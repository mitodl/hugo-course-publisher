# hugo-course-publisher

# Prerequisites
- docker-compose

# Running locally
To run the example course hugo site locally, open a terminal at the root of the repository and run `docker-compose up`.  This will download hugo in a docker container and run `hugo server` inside of it, exposing the site to your local machine.  Once the server is running, it will be available at http://localhost:1313/.
