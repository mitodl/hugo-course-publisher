  This resource tells to explore the relationship between driven current and
  driving emf in three simple circuits that contain: (1) only resistance; (2)
  only inductance; and (3) only capacitance, to examine these same relationships
  in the general case where R, L, and C are all present, and to do two sample
  problems on the LRC circuits.
