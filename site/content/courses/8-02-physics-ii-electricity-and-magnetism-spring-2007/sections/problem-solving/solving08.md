description: >-
  This resource tells to  gain intuition for the behavior of DC circuits with
  both resistors and capacitors or inductors. In this particular problem solving
  you will be working with an RC circuit. You should carefully consider what
  would change if the capacitor were replaced with an inductor and to calculate
  the time dependent currents in such circuits.
