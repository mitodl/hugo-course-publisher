  This resource tells  about using Ampere?s Law for calculating magnetic fields
  from symmetric current distributions, to find an expression for the magnetic
  field of a cylindrical current-carrying shell of inner radius a and outer
  radius b using Ampere?s Law and to find an expression for the magnetic field
  of a slab of current using Ampere?s Law.
