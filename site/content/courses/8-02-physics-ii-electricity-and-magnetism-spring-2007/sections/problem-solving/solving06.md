  This resource tell about To look at the behavior of a charged particle in a
  uniform magnetic field by studying the operation of a mass spectrometer, to
  calculate the torque on a rectangular loop of current-carrying wire sitting in
  an external magnetic field and define the magnetic dipole moment of a loop of
  current-carrying wire and write the torque on the loop in terms of that vector
  and the external magnetic field.
