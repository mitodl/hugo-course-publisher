description: >-
  This resource tells about to explore a particular situation that can lead to a
  changing magnetic flux through the open surface bounded by an electric
  circuit, to calculate the rate of change of magnetic flux through the open
  surface bounded by that circuit in this situation, to determine the sense of
  the induced current in the circuit from Lenz?s Law and to look at the forces
  on the current carrying wires in our circuit and determine the effects of
  these forces on the dynamics of the circuit.
