  This resource tells to introduce the "displacement current" term that Maxwell
  added to Ampere?s Law, to find the magnetic field inside a charging
  cylindrical capacitor using this new term in Ampere?s Law, to introduce the
  concept of energy flow through space in the electromagnetic field, to quantify
  that energy flow by introducing the Pointing vector and to do a calculation of
  the rate at which energy flows into a capacitor when it is charging, and show
  that it accounts for the rate at which electric energy stored in the capacitor
  is increasing.
