  <p>Magnet Levitating Above A Superconducting Ring: The image shows a permanent
  magnet levitating above a conducting non-magnetic ring with zero resistance.
  The magnet is levitated by eddy currents induced in the ring by the
  approaching magnet. These currents are always such as to repel the magnet, by
  Lenz's Law. (Image by&nbsp;Mark Bessette.)</p>

This freshman-level course is the second semester of introductory physics. The focus is on electricity and magnetism. The subject is taught using the TEAL (Technology Enabled Active Learning) format which utilizes small group interaction and current technology. The TEAL/Studio Project at MIT is a new approach to physics education designed to help students develop much better intuition about, and conceptual models of, physical phenomena.
