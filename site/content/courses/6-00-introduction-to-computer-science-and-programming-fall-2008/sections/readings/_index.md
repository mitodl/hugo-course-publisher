Below, you'll find a set of online resources designed to accompany the 6.00 lectures. We've found that the readings are generally more effective when done after the lecture, though you are of course welcome to read them at any time.

General References
------------------

A textbook for 6.00 is now available. The book and the course lectures parallel each other, though there is more detail in the book about some topics. The book is NOT required. We will not be referring to it in assignments or depending upon it to cover holes in the lectures.

If you choose not to purchase this book, you will probably find it useful to buy or borrow another book that covers Python. You might check your local public library's resources, or search online for a free Python text, such as [_How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) or ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[_An Introduction to Python (PDF)_](http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/Python.pdf).
