course_description: >-
  <p>The tools of probability theory, and of the related field of statistical
  inference, are the keys for being able to analyze and make sense of data.
  These tools underlie important advances in many fields, from the basic
  sciences to engineering and management.</p> <p>This resource is a companion
  site to <a href="./resolveuid/bb36e37dde28d3a69c2e7565384a0c62">6.041SC
  Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability</a>. It covers the same
  content, using videos developed for an <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edX
