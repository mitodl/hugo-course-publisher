title: Lecture Overview
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='1230'>In this lecture, we provide a quick introduction into
  the</span> <span m='4490'>conceptual framework of classical statistics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='7990'>We use the words "classical" to make the distinction
  from</span> <span m='11710'>the Bayesian framework that we have been using so
  far.</span> </p><p><span m='15540'>Recall that in the Bayesian framework,
  unknown quantities</span> <span m='18890'>are viewed as random variables that
  have a certain prior</span> <span m='22110'>distribution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='23690'>In contrast, in the classical setting an unknown quantity is</span>
  <span m='27770'>viewed as a non-random constant that just happens to</span>
  <span m='31560'>be unknown.</span> </p><p><span m='33930'>We can still carry
  out estimation without assuming a</span> <span m='36950'>prior for the unknown
  quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='39650'>For example, if the unknown theta is
  the mean of a certain</span> <span m='43190'>distribution, we can generate
  many samples from that</span> <span m='46630'>distribution and form the sample
  mean.</span> </p><p><span m='49960'>The weak law of large numbers then tells
  us that this</span> <span m='53110'>estimate will approach in the limit as n
  increases the true</span> <span m='57690'>value of theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='60010'>After going through this argument, we will then take</span> <span
  m='63440'>the occasion to introduce some terminology that is often used</span>
  <span m='66960'>in connection with classical estimation methods.</span>
  </p><p><span m='71010'>Now, the sample mean provides us a point estimate for
  the</span> <span m='74940'>unknown theta, but does not tell us how accurate
  that</span> <span m='78720'>estimate is.</span> </p><p><span m='80510'>To give
  a sense of the accuracy involved, we</span> <span m='83400'>introduce the
  concept of a confidence interval, which is</span> <span m='87180'>an interval
  that has high probability of containing the</span> <span m='91110'>true
  theta.</span> </p><p><span m='93140'>In general, it is a common practice to
  report not just</span> <span m='96560'>estimates, but also confidence
  intervals.</span> </p><p><span m='99950'>But as we will discuss, one has to be
  careful in</span> <span m='103120'>interpreting what exactly a confidence
  interval tells us.</span> </p><p><span m='108300'>We will see that we can
  easily calculate confidence intervals</span> <span m='111650'>using the
  central limit theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='113800'>And we will discuss in
  some detail some extra steps that</span> <span m='117250'>need to be taken if
  we do not know the variance of the</span> <span m='120930'>random variables
  involved.</span> </p><p><span m='124630'>We will then continue in the
  direction of greater</span> <span m='127080'>generality.</span> </p><p><span
  m='128410'>We will see that by repeated use of various sample means,</span>
  <span m='132550'>we can also estimate more complicated quantities, such</span>
  <span m='136210'>as, for example, the correlation coefficient</span> <span
  m='138970'>between two random variables.</span> </p><p><span m='142160'>We
  will conclude by introducing a general</span> <span m='144990'>estimation
  methodology, the so-called maximum likelihood</span> <span
  m='149120'>estimation method.</span> </p><p><span m='150940'>This is a method
  that applies always, even when the unknown</span> <span m='155300'>parameter
  of interest cannot be interpreted as an</span> <span
  m='158240'>expectation.</span> </p><p><span m='159650'>It is a
  universally-applicable method.</span> </p><p><span m='162200'>And fortunately,
  has some very desirable properties.</span> </p><p></p>
