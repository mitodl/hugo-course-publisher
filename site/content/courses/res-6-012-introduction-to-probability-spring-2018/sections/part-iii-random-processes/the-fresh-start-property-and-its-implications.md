title: The Fresh Start Property and Its Implications
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='530'>This segment is probably the most critical one</span> <span
  m='3500'>for the purpose of understanding what the Poisson process
  really</span> <span m='7040'>is and how it behaves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='9260'>There will be almost no mathematical formulas.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12050'>But the segment will be quite dense</span> <span m='14560'>in terms
  of conceptual reasoning.</span> </p><p><span m='16960'>So pay a lot of
  attention.</span> </p><p><span m='20100'>In a nutshell, we will argue that the
  Poisson process has</span> <span m='24360'>memorylessness properties that are
  entirely similar to those</span> <span m='28470'>that we have seen for the
  Bernoulli process.</span> </p><p><span m='30862'>This should not be
  surprising, since the Poisson process can</span> <span m='34190'>be thought of
  as a limiting case of the Bernoulli process.</span> </p><p><span m='37710'>We
  will reason through these properties,</span> <span m='39660'>not in the style
  of a formal mathematical proof,</span> <span m='42610'>but with an intuitive
  argument.</span> </p><p><span m='44960'>But I would like to assure you that
  the intuitive argument can</span> <span m='48240'>be translated into a
  rigorous proof.</span> </p><p><span m='52690'>The first property is the
  following.</span> </p><p><span m='55050'>The process starts at time 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='57970'>You come in and start watching at let's say time
  7.</span> </p><p><span m='63130'>Or more generally, instead of time 7,</span>
  <span m='65519'>suppose that you come in and start</span> <span
  m='67500'>watching at some time, little t.</span> </p><p><span m='70250'>The
  important thing here is that little t is a constant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='73900'>It's a deterministic number.</span> </p><p><span m='76500'>Starting
  at that time, what will you see?</span> </p><p><span m='82590'>Well, the
  original process was Poisson.</span> </p><p><span m='86210'>This means that
  disjoint intervals</span> <span m='89140'>in the original process are
  independent.</span> </p><p><span m='93229'>Therefore, disjoint intervals in
  the process</span> <span m='96450'>that you will be seeing will also be
  independent.</span> </p><p><span m='101360'>Furthermore, during any little
  interval of length</span> <span m='105100'>delta in the process that you
  see</span> <span m='107509'>will still have probability lambda times</span>
  <span m='109880'>delta, approximately, of seeing and arrival.</span>
  </p><p><span m='113330'>Therefore, what you see also satisfies the
  properties</span> <span m='116650'>of a Poisson process, and is itself a
  Poisson process.</span> </p><p><span m='121220'>Second, the original process
  was Poisson.</span> </p><p><span m='125860'>So different intervals are
  independent.</span> </p><p><span m='128509'>So whatever happens in this
  interval</span> <span m='130520'>is independent from whatever happens in that
  interval.</span> </p><p><span m='133180'>But that interval corresponds to the
  future of the process,</span> <span m='136550'>and therefore, the future of
  the process, what you get to see,</span> <span m='141079'>is independent from
  the past history.</span> </p><p><span m='143990'>And so the conclusion is that
  the process that you get to see</span> <span m='147900'>is a Poisson process,
  which is independent of the history</span> <span m='152180'>until the time
  that you started watching.</span> </p><p><span m='155150'>And we say,
  therefore, that what you see</span> <span m='157970'>is a fresh starting
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='162520'>The Poisson process starts fresh at
  time t.</span> </p><p><span m='166280'>We have the fresh start
  property.</span> </p><p><span m='168640'>And similar to the language we use
  for the Bernoulli process,</span> <span m='171360'>the fresh start property
  means that you see a process that's</span> <span m='175340'>independent of the
  past and which</span> <span m='177630'>has the same statistical properties as
  if this was time</span> <span m='181890'>0, as if the process was just
  starting right now.</span> </p><p><span m='186930'>One consequence of this
  fresh start property</span> <span m='189810'>is the following.</span>
  </p><p><span m='191230'>You start watching at time t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='193600'>And you're interested in the time</span> <span m='195720'>it takes
  until the next arrival.</span> </p><p><span m='199820'>What are the properties
  of this random variable?</span> </p><p><span m='203640'>Well, since you have a
  fresh starting Poisson process</span> <span m='206490'>at this time, this is
  the time until the first arrival</span> <span m='210410'>in this fresh
  starting Poisson process.</span> </p><p><span m='214270'>And the time until
  the first arrival</span> <span m='216940'>in a process that is just
  starting,</span> <span m='219079'>we know that it has an exponential
  distribution.</span> </p><p><span m='222760'>So this is going to be an
  exponential random variable</span> <span m='226090'>with the same parameter,
  lambda.</span> </p><p><span m='228579'>Furthermore, because the process starts
  fresh,</span> <span m='231329'>whatever happens in the future is independent
  from the past.</span> </p><p><span m='235120'>And so this random variable, the
  remaining time,</span> <span m='238310'>is independent of whatever happened in
  the past until time</span> <span m='243010'>t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='249810'>Now let us look at a somewhat different situation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='253480'>You start watching the process at time T1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='259000'>Time T1 is the time of the first arrival.</span>
  </p><p><span m='263600'>And you start watching from here on.</span>
  </p><p><span m='267130'>What is it that you're going to see?</span>
  </p><p><span m='269530'>Suppose that the first arrival happens,</span> <span
  m='271860'>let's say, at time equal to 3.</span> </p><p><span m='274760'>So
  we're conditioning on this event.</span> </p><p><span m='277659'>In that case,
  you start watching the process at time 3.</span> </p><p><span m='281290'>And
  you also know that the first arrival happened at time 3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='285540'>But this fact about the first arrival happening at time 3</span>
  <span m='289220'>belongs to the history of the process until time 3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='293710'>This is information about the past,</span> <span
  m='295850'>and does not affect what is going to happen after time 3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='300400'>The process after time 3 will be independent from the
  history</span> <span m='304710'>until time 3 and whatever happened until that
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='308120'>So starting at that particular time 3,
  what you see</span> <span m='311840'>is a Poisson process that is independent
  from the past.</span> </p><p><span m='315860'>Now, this argument is valid even
  if I</span> <span m='318830'>were to use here a 3.5 or 3.4 or 3.7.</span>
  </p><p><span m='324260'>No matter when this first arrival occurred,</span>
  <span m='328130'>what I see starting from this time</span> <span m='330820'>is
  a Poisson process which is independent from the past.</span> </p><p><span
  m='336860'>At the time of the first arrival,</span> <span m='338850'>the
  process just starts fresh.</span> </p><p><span m='343230'>As a consequence of
  this, and by repeating the argument that we</span> <span m='347070'>carried
  out for the remaining time until the next arrival</span> <span m='350260'>up
  here, we can repeat this argument</span> <span m='352900'>and argue that the
  time until the next arrival</span> <span m='356590'>in this fresh starting
  process, this</span> <span m='360440'>will also be an exponential random
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='365490'>Now, this time until the next
  arrival</span> <span m='367780'>is the difference between the second
  arrival</span> <span m='370890'>time and the first arrival time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='373380'>And we denote it by T2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='376310'>What we just argued is that this time until the next arrival</span>
  <span m='381280'>is going to be an exponential random variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='385230'>And also, it is independent from the past.</span>
  </p><p><span m='389620'>And in particular, it is independent from T1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='395620'>So the time until the second arrival,</span> <span
  m='398270'>starting from the first arrival, the second inter-arrival
  time</span> <span m='402500'>is a random variable that has an exponential
  distribution that</span> <span m='406350'>is the same distribution as that of
  T1,</span> <span m='409190'>and is independent from T1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='412030'>Now we can extend this argument and look at the kth</span> <span
  m='414870'>inter-arrival time.</span> </p><p><span m='416550'>For example, if
  the arrival numbered k minus 1</span> <span m='420410'>occurred here, and the
  k arrival occurs here,</span> <span m='423960'>this difference, here we denote
  it by Tk,</span> <span m='428650'>and by arguing in a similar way that the
  process starts</span> <span m='432270'>fresh at this particular time, the time
  until the next arrival</span> <span m='436490'>will also be an exponential
  random variable</span> <span m='439400'>with the same distribution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='441510'>And furthermore, will be independent</span> <span
  m='443660'>from the past history, and therefore,</span> <span
  m='446540'>independent from the earlier inter-arrival times.</span>
  </p><p><span m='451000'>And this has lots of important implications.</span>
  </p><p><span m='454730'>For example, the time until the kth arrival,</span>
  <span m='458840'>which is the sum of the first k inter-arrival times,</span>
  <span m='463260'>is the sum of independent, identically distributed,</span>
  <span m='467850'>exponential random variables.</span> </p><p><span
  m='470920'>In particular, this means that we can find the PDF of Yk</span>
  <span m='475170'>by convolving the exponential PDF</span> <span m='478370'>of
  these inter-arrival times, convolving this exponential PDF</span> <span
  m='483350'>with itself k times.</span> </p><p><span m='485570'>And this is
  indeed one way to find the PDF of Yk.</span> </p><p><span m='489490'>But
  fortunately for us, we were able to find it</span> <span m='492340'>with a
  much simpler argument.</span> </p><p><span m='493970'>And we already know what
  it is.</span> </p><p><span m='496590'>But this property here is also useful
  for finding</span> <span m='500490'>the mean and the variance of Yk.</span>
  </p><p><span m='502790'>The mean of the sum is the sum of the means.</span>
  </p><p><span m='505850'>And since the random variables are independent,</span>
  <span m='507960'>the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.</span>
  </p><p><span m='510980'>We know what is the mean and the variance of an
  exponential.</span> </p><p><span m='514280'>And so by multiplying that by k,
  we</span> <span m='517308'>obtain the mean of the kth arrival time</span>
  <span m='520429'>and the variance of the kth arrival time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='523630'>And so we now know the mean and variance</span> <span m='525720'>of
  the Erlang PDF of order k.</span> </p><p><span m='529820'>A second implication
  of this property</span> <span m='533290'>is more theoretical, more
  conceptual.</span> </p><p><span m='536150'>Recall that we defined the Poisson
  process</span> <span m='538960'>in terms of an independence assumption</span>
  <span m='541320'>and an assumption on the probability of arrivals</span> <span
  m='544540'>during a small interval.</span> </p><p><span m='546340'>But we
  could have defined the Poisson process as follows.</span> </p><p><span
  m='551780'>Consider a sequence of independent, identically</span> <span
  m='554600'>distributed exponentials.</span> </p><p><span m='556830'>Call them
  Tk.</span> </p><p><span m='558650'>And use these to define the arrival
  times.</span> </p><p><span m='563370'>This is a way of constructing a
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='567140'>What we argued in this segment
  is</span> <span m='569880'>that a Poisson process under the original
  definition</span> <span m='573500'>satisfies this new definition.</span>
  </p><p><span m='576970'>One can complete the argument to show</span> <span
  m='578830'>that the two definitions are equivalent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='580770'>It is possible to argue that if we define an arrival</span> <span
  m='584260'>process in this manner, this arrival process will also</span> <span
  m='588570'>satisfy the basic properties of the Poisson process.</span>
  </p><p><span m='592490'>This argument can indeed be carried out,</span> <span
  m='594720'>but we will not go through it.</span> </p><p><span m='597810'>A
  final implication, which is a little more practical.</span> </p><p><span
  m='601720'>If you want to simulate the Poisson process,</span> <span
  m='604440'>how would you do it?</span> </p><p><span m='606590'>Given what we
  now know, the most natural way is the following.</span> </p><p><span
  m='611130'>We generate independent, identically distributed,</span> <span
  m='615320'>exponential random variables, using</span> <span m='617560'>for
  example a random number generator.</span> </p><p><span m='620070'>And then use
  these exponential random variables</span> <span m='623730'>to construct the
  values of the inter arrival times.</span> </p><p><span m='627530'>And this
  way, construct a complete time history</span> <span m='630710'>of the Poisson
  process.</span> </p>
