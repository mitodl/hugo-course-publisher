title: Random Incidence in a Nonâ€“Poisson Process
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='670'>In this segment, we go through another random
  incidence</span> <span m='4420'>example, one that does not involve the Poisson
  process,</span> <span m='7710'>but a much simpler arrival process.</span>
  </p><p><span m='10950'>We do this for two reasons.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12860'>One is because of the simplicity of the example,</span> <span
  m='15490'>perhaps the intuition will be a little more transparent.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18880'>And the second reason is to illustrate</span> <span
  m='21170'>that we're dealing with a phenomenon that's</span> <span
  m='23030'>not specific to the Poisson process,</span> <span m='24980'>but is
  much more general.</span> </p><p><span m='26850'>The example is as
  follows.</span> </p><p><span m='28570'>We have an arrival process, in
  which</span> <span m='31060'>arrivals happen at random.</span> </p><p><span
  m='33100'>And the consecutive interarrival times</span> <span m='35600'>are
  independent, identically distributed, random variables.</span> </p><p><span
  m='39400'>However, unlike the Poisson process,</span> <span m='42060'>these
  interarrival times are not exponential random variables.</span> </p><p><span
  m='45960'>But instead, we assume that they are either</span> <span m='47940'>5
  or 10 minutes with equal probability.</span> </p><p><span m='51480'>So we have
  an arrival.</span> </p><p><span m='53550'>The next arrival may happen five
  minutes later.</span> </p><p><span m='56980'>The next arrival may again happen
  five minutes later.</span> </p><p><span m='60620'>Then maybe we get an
  interarrival interval of length</span> <span m='64120'>10, then maybe another
  interarrival interval of length</span> <span m='68110'>10, followed by one of
  five, and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='74820'>What is the expected value of
  the kth interarrival time?</span> </p><p><span m='79650'>Well, an interarrival
  time is with probability 1/2 of length</span> <span m='85539'>five and with
  probability 1/2 of length 10.</span> </p><p><span m='90500'>So the average
  interarrival time is 7.5.</span> </p><p><span m='97380'>Now, you show up at a
  random time.</span> </p><p><span m='100940'>And by random we mean a time
  that's</span> <span m='103289'>completely uncoordinated with the arrival
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='107900'>You show up at some point in
  time,</span> <span m='110259'>and you look at the interarrival interval in
  which you fall.</span> </p><p><span m='114000'>And you're interested in the
  length</span> <span m='116000'>of that particular interarrival
  interval.</span> </p><p><span m='119000'>What is the probability that you fall
  inside a five minute</span> <span m='122770'>interarrival interval?</span>
  </p><p><span m='126630'>Since intervals of length five are as likely</span>
  <span m='130259'>as intervals of length 10, in the long run,</span> <span
  m='133150'>there's going to be roughly as many five minute intervals</span>
  <span m='136760'>as there will be 10 minute intervals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='139520'>On the other hand, the 10 minute intervals</span> <span
  m='142360'>occupy twice as much space on the real line.</span> </p><p><span
  m='146750'>And for this reason, it is 2 times more likely</span> <span
  m='149570'>that you will fall in a 10 minute interval rather</span> <span
  m='152320'>than a five minute interval.</span> </p><p><span m='154500'>In
  other words, the probability of falling in a five minute</span> <span
  m='157720'>interval is going to be 1/3.</span> </p><p><span m='160160'>Whereas
  the probability of following in a 10 minute</span> <span m='162500'>interval
  is going to be 2/3.</span> </p><p><span m='164790'>For this reason, the
  expected length</span> <span m='166850'>of the interarrival interval that
  you</span> <span m='169050'>get to see when you arrive is equal to, with
  probability 1/3,</span> <span m='174420'>you see a five.</span> </p><p><span
  m='175760'>And with probability 2/3, you see a 10.</span> </p><p><span
  m='179370'>And this number evaluates approximately to 8.3,</span> <span
  m='184400'>which is indeed larger than 7.5.</span> </p><p><span m='188930'>The
  conclusion from this example is similar to the one</span> <span
  m='192330'>that we had for the Poisson process.</span> </p><p><span
  m='196010'>Although the average interarrival time</span> <span m='198500'>is
  7.5, when you show up at a random time</span> <span m='202280'>you are more
  likely to fall in a larger interval.</span> </p><p><span m='205480'>And for
  that reason, on the average,</span> <span m='207630'>you will be seeing longer
  interarrival intervals.</span> </p><p><span m='211860'>The calculations that
  we carried through in that simple example</span> <span m='214970'>can be
  generalized for more general arrival</span> <span m='217610'>processes, called
  renewal processes.</span> </p><p><span m='220180'>In a renewal process, once
  more the consecutive interarrival</span> <span m='224300'>times are
  independent, identically distributed,</span> <span m='227060'>random
  variables.</span> </p><p><span m='228370'>But they have a general
  distribution.</span> </p><p><span m='231180'>For this case, there's a formula
  again</span> <span m='233380'>that tells us the length or the expected</span>
  <span m='236490'>length of the interarrival interval that you get to
  see.</span> </p><p><span m='240720'>But the main message from this
  example</span> <span m='244610'>is that it does make a difference how you
  sample,</span> <span m='248280'>how you choose what to watch and what to
  measure.</span> </p><p><span m='252480'>It makes a difference whether
  you</span> <span m='254080'>decide to measure the kth interarrival time and
  it's</span> <span m='258190'>average value or to decide to measure</span>
  <span m='261940'>an interarrival time that's chosen</span> <span m='264140'>by
  showing up at a random time.</span> </p><p><span m='267170'>The two methods of
  sampling give you different results.</span> </p><p><span m='270350'>And we
  will see next a few examples</span> <span m='272800'>that have this particular
  flavor.</span> </p><p></p>
