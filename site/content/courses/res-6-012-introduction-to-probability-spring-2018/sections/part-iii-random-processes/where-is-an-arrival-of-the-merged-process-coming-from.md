title: Where is an Arrival of the Merged Process Coming From?
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='540'>As before, we have a red Poisson process and a green
  Poisson</span> <span m='6060'>process.</span> </p><p><span m='7730'>We merge
  these two processes, and we only</span> <span m='10410'>observe the merged
  process.</span> </p><p><span m='13090'>Here's an interesting question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='14830'>This is an arrival of the merged process.</span>
  </p><p><span m='17320'>Where did it come from?</span> </p><p><span
  m='18880'>Is it red, or is it green?</span> </p><p><span m='22170'>We cannot
  know, but can we tell what is the probability that it</span> <span
  m='26020'>came from the red stream?</span> </p><p><span m='28990'>The way to
  answer this question is</span> <span m='31350'>to look at the table of all the
  things</span> <span m='34340'>that can happen during a little interval</span>
  <span m='37810'>around that particular time in which we had an arrival.</span>
  </p><p><span m='42640'>We are told that there was an arrival at time t or an
  arrival</span> <span m='47390'>during an interval, a small interval around
  time t.</span> </p><p><span m='51760'>This means that we're told that this
  event here has happened.</span> </p><p><span m='58270'>Given this information,
  what is the conditional probability</span> <span m='62520'>that actually this
  event here occurred?</span> </p><p><span m='67340'>This is just the fraction
  of this probability divided</span> <span m='72080'>by the total probability of
  the conditioning event.</span> </p><p><span m='75370'>So the answer is lambda
  1 divided</span> <span m='78270'>by lambda 1 plus lambda 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='81789'>Does this answer make sense?</span> </p><p><span
  m='83730'>Well, suppose that lambda 1 and lambda 2 were equal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='87310'>In that case, by symmetry, when an arrival
  comes,</span> <span m='91070'>it should be equally likely to have come either
  from the red</span> <span m='94530'>or from the green stream.</span>
  </p><p><span m='96580'>And this is consistent with this answer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='100650'>We can reason similarly for a slightly different
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='105080'>You wait until the kth arrival, let's
  say the third arrival.</span> </p><p><span m='109620'>Where did that arrival
  come from?</span> </p><p><span m='112140'>Well, that case, arrival
  occurred</span> <span m='115000'>during a specific little time interval and
  conditioning</span> <span m='119700'>on it having occurred during that
  particular time interval,</span> <span m='123170'>we can then repeat the
  reasoning that we had here and argue</span> <span m='128190'>that given that
  we had an arrival-- it just happens</span> <span m='131370'>to be the third
  arrival during that time interval--</span> <span m='134270'>there's going to
  be this particular conditional</span> <span m='136680'>probability that it
  came from the red stream.</span> </p><p><span m='140050'>So we obtained the
  same answer once more.</span> </p><p><span m='144730'>Now, this arrival came
  from one of the two streams</span> <span m='149650'>with some
  probabilities.</span> </p><p><span m='151079'>This arrival came from one of
  the two streams</span> <span m='153420'>with some probabilities.</span>
  </p><p><span m='154930'>Does the origin of this arrival affect or
  depend</span> <span m='159140'>on the origin of that arrival?</span>
  </p><p><span m='161790'>Because we have assumed independence</span> <span
  m='164220'>across time for each one of the processes</span> <span
  m='166710'>that we started with-- and therefore, we also</span> <span
  m='168780'>have the same thing for the merged process-- whatever</span> <span
  m='172010'>has to do with events during this interval</span> <span
  m='176630'>is independent from anything that</span> <span m='178710'>has to do
  with events in that interval.</span> </p><p><span m='181500'>And because of
  this, one could argue formally--</span> <span m='184670'>but hopefully, this
  is intuitive enough--</span> <span m='187250'>that the origin of this arrival
  and the origin of that arrival</span> <span m='192310'>are independent
  events.</span> </p><p><span m='195690'>And now that we have this
  property,</span> <span m='198600'>we can answer questions such as the
  following.</span> </p><p><span m='202390'>We've had 10 arrivals so far.</span>
  </p><p><span m='205060'>What is the probability that exactly four out of these
  10</span> <span m='208930'>are red?</span> </p><p><span m='212610'>Each one of
  those arrivals has this probability of being red.</span> </p><p><span
  m='218750'>The origin of different arrivals are independent of each
  other.</span> </p><p><span m='223130'>So essentially, we're dealing with 10
  Bernoulli trials,</span> <span m='227240'>each of which has two possible
  outcomes, red or green,</span> <span m='232370'>and is red with this
  particular probability.</span> </p><p><span m='235160'>Therefore, the answer
  is going to be</span> <span m='237910'>given by the binomial probabilities,
  which</span> <span m='241090'>is the probability of having four successes in
  10 trials.</span> </p><p><span m='246780'>And we obtain lambda 1 over lambda 1
  plus lambda 2.</span> </p><p><span m='251580'>That's the probability of a red
  to the number of red arrivals.</span> </p><p><span m='256810'>And then the
  remaining probability,</span> <span m='258730'>1 minus that, which is lambda 2
  over lambda 1</span> <span m='264160'>plus lambda 2 to the remaining power,
  which is equal to 6.</span> </p><p><span m='270270'>So to summarize.</span>
  </p><p><span m='272110'>Each one of the arrivals in the merged process</span>
  <span m='275140'>has a certain probability of being</span> <span m='277680'>a
  red arrival or a green arrival.</span> </p><p><span m='281750'>Which one of
  the two is the case?</span> </p><p><span m='283940'>We can think of it as an
  outcome of Bernoulli trial,</span> <span m='287130'>and the Bernoulli trials
  associated</span> <span m='289580'>with different arrivals are independent of
  each other</span> <span m='293670'>as a consequence of the independence of
  Poisson</span> <span m='296880'>processes across time.</span> </p>
