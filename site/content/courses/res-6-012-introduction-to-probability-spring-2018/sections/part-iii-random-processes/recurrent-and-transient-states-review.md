title: 'Recurrent and Transient States: Review'
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="800">The other thing that we discussed in the last lecture</span>
  <span m="3220">was a classification of the different states of the
  Markov</span> <span m="6410">chain into different types.</span></p><p><span
  m="9270">A Markov chain in general has states</span> <span m="11440">that are
  recurrent, which means that from that recurrent state,</span> <span
  m="15740">you can go somewhere else and then from that somewhere else</span>
  <span m="19380">you can always come back to it.</span></p><p><span
  m="22090">So if you have a Markov chain of this form</span> <span
  m="25080">and you start in state nine, the options for you</span> <span
  m="27910">is to either go to state three or to state five.</span></p><p><span
  m="32000">But no matter what, if you go to three,</span> <span m="34630">you
  can come back always, and if you go to five,</span> <span m="37036">you can
  always come back as well.</span></p><p><span m="38410">So clearly nine here
  would be a recurrent state, and three</span> <span m="42830">for the same
  reason, and five as well.</span></p><p><span m="45890">Now, if you look at the
  state six or seven,</span> <span m="49120">it is the same
  thing.</span></p><p><span m="50180">Starting from six, the only way that you
  can go to</span> <span m="53600">is to either stay at six or go to seven, and
  then in that case</span> <span m="57400">you always come
  back.</span></p><p><span m="58360">And same thing from seven, you can either
  go to six</span> <span m="61620">and that's it's, actually, and come
  back.</span></p><p><span m="63540">So both of these are recurrent as
  well.</span></p><p><span m="67520">So in a case the state is not
  recurrent,</span> <span m="69930">we will call it
  transient.</span></p><p><span m="71030">So let's look at for example state
  one.</span></p><p><span m="74220">From state one, if you go from one to two
  and then go to six,</span> <span m="78260">there is no way to come back to
  one.</span></p><p><span m="80080">So the state 1 is transient, and for the
  same reason</span> <span m="83810">the state four will be transient,</span>
  <span m="85520">and the state 2 will be transient.</span></p><p><span
  m="87620">What about eight?</span></p><p><span m="88810">Well, the same
  reason, the state is transient as well.</span></p><p><span m="92900">So what
  we have seen also is the notion of a recurrent class.</span></p><p><span
  m="96440">A recurrent class is, again, a collection</span> <span m="99630">of
  recurrent states that can communicate between each other.</span></p><p><span
  m="103320">So here, for this specific example, we have two
  classes.</span></p><p><span m="107550">This is one class, right, so it's a
  class one.</span></p><p><span m="112970">Let's call it recurrent class
  one.</span></p><p><span m="116140">And this is a recurrent class, recurrent
  class two.</span></p><p><span m="122550">So here again we have two classes
  instead of one,</span> <span m="125610">because if you are in one of these
  classes,</span> <span m="130788">there is no way that you can find a path to
  go to one state</span> <span m="133970">here and vice
  versa.</span></p><p><span m="135710">If you are in one of these states
  here,</span> <span m="138480">there is no path that would lead you to that
  recurrent class.</span></p><p><span m="142670">In the case where you have two
  recurrent classes, like here</span> <span m="145950">or more, it is pretty
  clear that in the long run,</span> <span m="149980">the steady state behavior
  of the Markov chain</span> <span m="152200">will really depend on where you
  started.</span></p><p><span m="154980">So for example, if your Markov
  chain</span> <span m="157960">started in that recurrent class, there is no
  probability</span> <span m="162720">that in the long run it will be in that
  class, and vice versa.</span></p><p><span m="166500">If it started here, the
  probability</span> <span m="168600">of being in that recurrent class in the
  long run is zero.</span></p><p><span m="172800">So the long run behavior of
  the Markov chain</span> <span m="176390">will depend on the initial
  condition.</span></p><p><span m="180260">In the case where you have only one
  recurrent class,</span> <span m="183685">let's forget about that portion, for
  example,</span> <span m="186420">and you have only that portion
  here.</span></p><p><span m="189330">Then maybe the initial condition will
  not</span> <span m="192470">matter in the long run, but in fact it's</span>
  <span m="194970">not going to be always the case, depending</span> <span
  m="197470">on the recurrent class being periodic</span> <span m="199920">or
  not as we will see in the next clip.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
