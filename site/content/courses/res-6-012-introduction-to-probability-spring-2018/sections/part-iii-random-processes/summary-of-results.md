  <p><span m='560'>Let us now take stock and summarize</span> <span
  m='2850'>what we have done for these two processes, the Bernoulli</span> <span
  m='5690'>and the Poisson process, and their relation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8520'>The Poisson process runs in continuous time,</span> <span
  m='11350'>whereas, for the Bernoulli process,</span> <span m='13070'>time is
  discrete and is divided into slots.</span> </p><p><span m='16790'>The Poisson
  process is defined by a single parameter, lambda,</span> <span m='20440'>which
  is the intensity or arrival rate,</span> <span m='23220'>and tells us the
  expected number of arrivals per unit time.</span> </p><p><span m='27350'>For
  the Bernoulli process, we have, again,</span> <span m='29460'>one basic
  parameter, which is the probability of success</span> <span m='32520'>at any
  given trial, or the probability</span> <span m='35170'>of an arrival during
  each one of the slots.</span> </p><p><span m='39790'>Based on our model, we
  were interested in three kinds</span> <span m='43950'>of quantities.</span>
  </p><p><span m='45470'>And we found the distributions of them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='47810'>The first quantity is the number of arrivals</span>
  <span m='50620'>during a certain time interval.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52820'>For the discrete case, the number of arrivals</span> <span
  m='55630'>has a binomial distribution, whereas for the one Poisson</span>
  <span m='58730'>case, the distribution is that of a Poisson random
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='63740'>Then we looked at the time until the
  first arrival,</span> <span m='67880'>or the time between consecutive
  arrivals.</span> </p><p><span m='71000'>For the Bernoulli process, that
  distribution is geometric.</span> </p><p><span m='73820'>For the Poisson
  process, that distribution is exponential.</span> </p><p><span m='77180'>Note
  that in this instance, we're</span> <span m='78630'>dealing with a discrete
  random variable,</span> <span m='80500'>but, here, with a continuous random
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='83060'>And then, as a generalization,
  we</span> <span m='84970'>could find the time until a kth arrival, which, in
  the Poisson</span> <span m='89570'>case, is given by an Erlang
  distribution.</span> </p><p><span m='93090'>And for the Bernoulli case, we
  developed</span> <span m='95140'>one particular formula.</span> </p><p><span
  m='96500'>And that formula is actually known</span> <span m='98220'>under the
  name of the Pascal distribution.</span> </p><p><span m='102420'>All of these
  results, for the Poisson case,</span> <span m='106060'>were obtained because
  we used an approximation argument.</span> </p><p><span m='110530'>That is, we
  had the results for the Bernoulli case.</span> </p><p><span m='113960'>But
  then we argued that the Poisson process</span> <span m='116360'>is a limiting
  case of the Bernoulli process</span> <span m='119850'>in which we take time,
  divide it into a large number of slots,</span> <span m='125080'>during each
  one of the slots, however,</span> <span m='126870'>we have a small probability
  of an arrival.</span> </p><p><span m='129560'>And this is done in a way so
  that the product of these two</span> <span m='132970'>numbers stays a
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='135500'>By using a finer and finer
  discretization,</span> <span m='138590'>we could approach the Poisson process
  arbitrarily</span> <span m='142990'>close by a Bernoulli process.</span>
  </p><p><span m='145250'>And then we used the Bernoulli formulas</span> <span
  m='147360'>in which we took the limit as delta was going to zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='151130'>And this gave us the result for the Poisson
  case.</span> </p>
