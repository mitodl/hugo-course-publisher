title: The Time of the K-th Arrival
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='499'>An interesting random variable associated with the
  Bernoulli</span> <span m='3600'>process is the time of the kth success</span>
  <span m='6840'>or the time of the kth arrival, depending</span> <span
  m='9340'>on what kind of context we have in mind.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12290'>So the picture is as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='13700'>The
  process starts and we wait until the first arrival occurs,</span> <span
  m='21040'>and the time that it occurs, we call that time Y1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='25380'>Then we keep observing the process,</span> <span
  m='27990'>and there's a time at which a second arrival comes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='31670'>We call that time Y2.</span> </p><p><span m='34080'>The
  process continues, and there is a certain time</span> <span m='37660'>that the
  third arrival comes.</span> </p><p><span m='40000'>We call that time
  Y3.</span> </p><p><span m='44860'>Now, the time that the first arrival
  comes,</span> <span m='49390'>this is also what we called T1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='54154'>T1 is this length.</span> </p><p><span m='56150'>It's
  the time until the first arrival.</span> </p><p><span m='59890'>Let us give a
  name to the time it takes from the first</span> <span m='64120'>to the second
  arrival, and we call that time T2,</span> <span m='68789'>which is the second
  inter-arrival time.</span> </p><p><span m='71670'>And similarly, we will call
  T3 the time</span> <span m='75600'>between the second and the third
  arrival.</span> </p><p><span m='79710'>So we define in general Tk to be the
  difference between two</span> <span m='83770'>consecutive arrival
  times.</span> </p><p><span m='86900'>And of course, the time of the third
  arrival</span> <span m='89770'>is the sum of T1 plus T2 plus T3, the first
  three</span> <span m='93270'>inter-arrival times.</span> </p><p><span
  m='94880'>And more generally, Yk is going to be the sum of these k</span>
  <span m='99259'>inter-arrival times.</span> </p><p><span m='101550'>So in
  order to study the random variable Yk and its properties,</span> <span
  m='106370'>the way that we can proceed is to understand</span> <span
  m='108950'>first the random variables Ti.</span> </p><p><span m='112250'>What
  kind of random variables are they?</span> </p><p><span m='115130'>Well, we
  know that T1, the time until the first arrival,</span> <span m='118850'>has a
  geometric distribution with parameter p.</span> </p><p><span m='122300'>Now,
  at the time of the first arrival,</span> <span m='124930'>the process starts
  fresh.</span> </p><p><span m='127340'>So after this time, there will be</span>
  <span m='130009'>a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials,</span> <span
  m='133550'>and T2 will be the number of Bernoulli trials</span> <span
  m='136040'>it takes until an arrival.</span> </p><p><span m='139290'>So T2
  will also be geometric with the same parameter, p.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143530'>Furthermore, because the process starts fresh,</span> <span
  m='146520'>whatever happens in the future after this time</span> <span
  m='150340'>is independent from whatever happened in the past,</span> <span
  m='153950'>and so the random variable T2 will be independent from T1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='158670'>And then by a similar argument, T3</span> <span
  m='161800'>will be independent from T1 and T2</span> <span m='165110'>and will
  also have the same geometric distribution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='169990'>Based on these properties, we can now</span> <span m='173390'>go
  ahead and calculate properties of Yk.</span> </p><p><span m='176730'>Yk is the
  sum of random variables.</span> </p><p><span m='179530'>The expected value of
  Yk is the sum</span> <span m='181810'>of the expected values of the Ts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='184030'>Each one of the Ts has a geometric distribution</span>
  <span m='187320'>with parameter p, and in particular</span> <span
  m='189270'>has a mean of 1 over p.</span> </p><p><span m='192000'>By adding
  those means, we obtain that the mean of Yk</span> <span m='195410'>is k over
  p.</span> </p><p><span m='196740'>Similarly, the variance of Yk will</span>
  <span m='199730'>be equal to the sum of the variances</span> <span
  m='201960'>of the Tis, the reason being that the Tis are independent,</span>
  <span m='206620'>and so to find the variance of the sum,</span> <span
  m='208660'>it's enough to just add the variances.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211350'>And we have a formula for the variance of a geometric,</span> <span
  m='214220'>and using that formula and multiplying it by k,</span> <span
  m='216980'>we obtain the variance of Yk.</span> </p><p><span
  m='219450'>Finally, we would like to calculate the PMF of Yk.</span>
  </p><p><span m='223890'>So we would like to find this probability here,</span>
  <span m='227430'>the probability that Yk takes on a specific value equal to
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='233130'>Notice that in this argument, we're</span>
  <span m='235610'>thinking of k as a fixed, given number.</span> </p><p><span
  m='238610'>For example, we're interested in the time of the fifth
  arrival.</span> </p><p><span m='242840'>This is a random variable that can
  take different values,</span> <span m='245790'>t, and we want to find the
  probabilities</span> <span m='248510'>of those different values, t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='250400'>So think of k as being fixed and t as a parameter that
  varies,</span> <span m='255140'>and we want to carry out this
  calculation</span> <span m='257310'>for all possible choices of t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='260269'>Now, what is this event here?</span> </p><p><span
  m='262320'>This is the event that the kth arrival occurs at time t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='269360'>So this means that at time t, we have an
  arrival.</span> </p><p><span m='273720'>But for this to be the kth
  arrival,</span> <span m='276409'>we must have k minus 1 arrivals in the
  previous time</span> <span m='283090'>slots, of which there's t minus 1 of
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='290100'>The probability that Yk is equal to
  t</span> <span m='292695'>is the probability that these two events happen,
  k</span> <span m='296070'>minus 1 arrivals in t minus 1 slots and one
  arrival</span> <span m='301010'>at slot number t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='304200'>So we are looking at the probability</span> <span m='306080'>that
  these two events occur.</span> </p><p><span m='309220'>Now this event, k minus
  1 arrivals in t minus 1 slots,</span> <span m='313460'>is an event that's
  completely determined</span> <span m='315480'>by whatever happens in the first
  t minus 1 time slots,</span> <span m='319860'>whereas the event of an arrival
  at slot time t</span> <span m='322830'>refers to whatever happens during slot
  time t.</span> </p><p><span m='326210'>Because of our assumptions on the
  Bernoulli process, whatever</span> <span m='329900'>happens during these t
  minus 1 time slots</span> <span m='334080'>is independent from what happens in
  slot number t.</span> </p><p><span m='338270'>So the probability of these two
  events happening,</span> <span m='342140'>because of independence, will be the
  probability</span> <span m='346170'>of the first event happening, k minus 1
  arrivals in time</span> <span m='354370'>t minus 1, times the probability of
  an arrival at time t.</span> </p><p><span m='368980'>Now, the first
  probability is given by the binomial formula.</span> </p><p><span
  m='373840'>In t minus 1 time slots, we want to have k minus 1 arrivals.</span>
  </p><p><span m='378630'>And the binomial formula gives us</span> <span
  m='380960'>an exponent, p to this power times 1 minus p</span> <span
  m='386370'>to the power that's the difference of these two</span> <span
  m='388510'>numbers, which is t minus k.</span> </p><p><span m='390920'>And
  then finally, we multiply with the probability</span> <span m='393280'>of an
  arrival at time t, which is equal to p.</span> </p><p><span m='396930'>This p
  will cancel the exponent of minus 1 up here</span> <span m='401100'>and leads
  us to this formula for the probability</span> <span m='404820'>that the kth
  arrival happens at time t.</span> </p><p><span m='408490'>Notice the range of
  the random variable Yk.</span> </p><p><span m='412085'>The kth arrival cannot
  happen before time k.</span> </p><p><span m='416780'>You need at least k time
  slots to obtain k arrivals,</span> <span m='420320'>so this probability will
  be positive</span> <span m='423890'>only starting at time k and for future
  times.</span> </p><p><span m='428560'>So this random variable Yk, in
  general,</span> <span m='432220'>will have a PMF of this form.</span>
  </p><p><span m='437000'>It's zero for ts smaller than k, and then at time k,
  in general,</span> <span m='445790'>it's going to be a positive entry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='448340'>And for future values of t, it will also</span> <span
  m='452300'>have positive entries.</span> </p><p><span m='454020'>And this PMF
  extends all the way to infinity</span> <span m='458320'>because it is possible
  that the kth arrival takes</span> <span m='462240'>an arbitrarily long time to
  occur.</span> </p><p><span m='466520'>If we consider different values of k, of
  course</span> <span m='469770'>we will get a different PMF.</span>
  </p><p><span m='472350'>The PMF of Y3 is different than the PMF of Y2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='477990'>And the PMF of Y3 will generally sit</span> <span
  m='481160'>to the right of the PMF of Y2 because the third arrival</span>
  <span m='486100'>generally will take longer to occur than the second
  arrival.</span> </p><p></p>
