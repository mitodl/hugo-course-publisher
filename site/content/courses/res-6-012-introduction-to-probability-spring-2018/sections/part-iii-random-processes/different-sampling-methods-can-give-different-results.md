title: Different Sampling Methods Can Give Different Results
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="510">In this segment, we want to reinforce the message</span>
  <span m="3300">that how you choose to sample can give different
  results,</span> <span m="7780">and the choice of sampling is
  important.</span></p><p><span m="10180">Suppose you're interested in measuring
  the average family</span> <span m="13810">size in some
  population.</span></p><p><span m="16260">Suppose that there are families that
  are small</span> <span m="19450">and have just one person in them,</span>
  <span m="22890">and there's also a family that has many people in
  it.</span></p><p><span m="31770">What does it mean to measure the average
  family size?</span></p><p><span m="35250">One possibility is to pick at random
  a family, each family</span> <span m="40760">being chosen with equal
  probability,</span> <span m="43750">and talk about the expected value that you
  get,</span> <span m="46810">or the average value if you sample that
  way.</span></p><p><span m="50190">In this particular example with probability
  1/4,</span> <span m="54410">you get a 1, with probability 1/4, you get a
  1</span> <span m="57190">with probability 1/4, you get a 1.</span></p><p><span
  m="59480">So the answer would be with probability 3/4 you get a 1,</span>
  <span m="63420">and with probability 1/4, you get a 6.</span></p><p><span
  m="69360">But suppose that instead, you pick a person at random</span> <span
  m="74120">and you ask for that person, how big is your
  family?</span></p><p><span m="78680">What's the expected value of the answer
  you're going to get?</span></p><p><span m="82420">Here we have nine
  people.</span></p><p><span m="84630">Out of those nine people, 3 of
  them</span> <span m="87940">will give you an answer my family has size
  one,</span> <span m="91870">and six of those people will give you an
  answer,</span> <span m="96229">my family has a size of six.</span></p><p><span
  m="99970">And this number is going to be larger</span> <span m="102770">than
  the previous number.</span></p><p><span m="104330">You're going to get
  different answers.</span></p><p><span m="106920">So it is possible to have a
  situation where</span> <span m="109220">you can make a statement such as the
  following.</span></p><p><span m="112340">The average family size is
  three,</span> <span m="116759">but the average person lives in a family of
  size four.</span></p><p><span m="122070">There is no contradiction between
  these two statements</span> <span m="124840">because we're measuring different
  things.</span></p><p><span m="127730">Another example of the same
  flavor.</span></p><p><span m="130259">You're interested in the average bus
  occupancy.</span></p><p><span m="133250">You're interested in whether buses
  are crowded or not</span> <span m="136500">in your city.</span></p><p><span
  m="138050">One way of carrying out this calculation</span> <span m="141850">is
  to pick buses at random, each bus</span> <span m="145400">is equally likely to
  be picked, and see</span> <span m="147530">how many people are riding this
  bus.</span></p><p><span m="150640">Another possibility is to take a typical
  passenger,</span> <span m="155030">a random passenger, and ask them, how
  crowded was your bus?</span></p><p><span m="160290">Take an extreme
  case.</span></p><p><span m="161930">Suppose that half of the buses have 0
  people in them,</span> <span m="165860">and half of the buses have 50 people
  in them.</span></p><p><span m="170440">If you look at random buses, then the
  average occupancy</span> <span m="175050">would be 25.</span></p><p><span
  m="177150">But if you ask passengers, all of the passengers</span> <span
  m="180720">would report 50, and it would be, again, a different
  answer.</span></p><p><span m="186020">A similar situation is if you're talking
  about average class</span> <span m="189900">sizes.</span></p><p><span
  m="191280">One method is to look at all the classes,</span> <span
  m="194060">see how many students there are in each class,</span> <span
  m="196410">and take the average.</span></p><p><span m="198079">Another method
  would be to ask a typical student,</span> <span m="202860">how large is your
  class?</span></p><p><span m="205150">Because more students are in large
  classes, when</span> <span m="209240">you pick a student at random, you</span>
  <span m="211430">are likely to get a higher answer, as opposed</span> <span
  m="214710">to when you look at a random class.</span></p><p><span
  m="217770">The moral from all these examples</span> <span m="220250">is that
  it is very important to be</span> <span m="222450">careful about what you
  choose to sample.</span></p><p><span m="225730">When you pick at random, what
  exactly</span> <span m="227860">are you picking at random?</span></p><p><span
  m="229720">And you need to be aware that different sampling</span> <span
  m="232390">methods measure different things,</span> <span m="235000">and will
  generally give you different results.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
