transcript: >-
  <p><span m="400">As an introduction to the main topic of this lecture</span>
  <span m="2890">sequence, let us go through a simple example and on the
  way,</span> <span m="6520">review what we have learned so
  far.</span></p><p><span m="8830">The example that we're going to consider
  involves three</span> <span m="11670">tosses of a biased
  coin.</span></p><p><span m="14660">It's a coin that results in heads with
  probability p.</span></p><p><span m="19150">We're going to make this a little
  more precise.</span></p><p><span m="21350">And the coin is biased in the sense
  that this number p is</span> <span m="24560">not necessarily the same as one
  half.</span></p><p><span m="27250">We represent this particular probabilistic
  experiment in</span> <span m="31130">terms a tree that shows us the different
  stages of the</span> <span m="35290">experiment.</span></p><p><span
  m="36570">Each particular branch corresponds to a sequence of</span> <span
  m="39710">possible results in the different stages, and the</span> <span
  m="42710">leaves of this tree correspond to the possible
  outcomes.</span></p><p><span m="46500">The branches of this tree are annotated
  by certain numbers,</span> <span m="50030">and these numbers are to be
  interpreted appropriately as</span> <span m="52810">probabilities or
  conditional probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="55360">So for example, this
  number here is interpreted as the</span> <span m="59190">probability of heads
  in the first toss, an event that we</span> <span m="62930">denote as
  H1.</span></p><p><span m="65140">This number here is to be interpreted as a
  conditional</span> <span m="68800">probability.</span></p><p><span
  m="70150">It's the conditional probability of obtaining heads</span> <span
  m="72760">in the second toss given that the first</span> <span m="75900">toss
  resulted in heads.</span></p><p><span m="78230">And finally, this number here
  is to be interpreted as the</span> <span m="81900">conditional probability of
  heads in the third toss, given</span> <span m="87650">that the first toss
  resulted in heads and the second toss</span> <span m="91510">also resulted in
  heads.</span></p><p><span m="96210">Let us now continue with some
  calculations.</span></p><p><span m="102160">First, we're going to practice the
  multiplication rule, which</span> <span m="107070">allows us to calculate the
  probability</span> <span m="109539">of a certain outcome.</span></p><p><span
  m="112400">In this case, the outcome of interest is tails followed by</span>
  <span m="116690">heads followed by tails.</span></p><p><span m="118990">So
  we're talking about this particular outcome here.</span></p><p><span
  m="122070">According to the multiplication rule, to find</span> <span
  m="124580">the probability of a particular final outcome, we</span> <span
  m="128320">multiply probabilities and conditional probabilities</span> <span
  m="131590">along the path that leads to this particular
  outcome.</span></p><p><span m="134980">So in this case, it's (1 minus p) times
  p times (1 minus p).</span></p><p><span m="141790">Let us now calculate the
  probability</span> <span m="144280">of a certain event.</span></p><p><span
  m="146210">The event of interest is the event that we obtain exactly</span>
  <span m="149760">one head in the three tosses.</span></p><p><span
  m="152579">This is an event that can happen in multiple
  ways.</span></p><p><span m="155200">Here is one possibility where we have a
  single head.</span></p><p><span m="159280">Here's another
  possibility.</span></p><p><span m="161360">And here's a third
  one.</span></p><p><span m="162860">These are the three possible ways that we
  can have exactly</span> <span m="166740">one head, depending on where
  exactly</span> <span m="170160">that single head appears.</span></p><p><span
  m="172210">Is it in the first toss, in the second, or in the
  third.</span></p><p><span m="175550">To find the total probability of this
  event, we need to add</span> <span m="179520">the probability of the different
  outcomes that</span> <span m="181950">correspond to this
  event.</span></p><p><span m="184450">The probability of this outcome is p
  times (1 minus p)</span> <span m="187490">squared, the probability of this
  outcome is what we</span> <span m="190420">calculated.</span></p><p><span
  m="191180">It's, again, p times (1 minus p) squared.</span></p><p><span
  m="193490">And the probability of the third one is also p times 1</span> <span
  m="196460">minus p squared.</span></p><p><span m="197829">So the answer is 3p
  times (1 minus p) squared.</span></p><p><span m="202290">Notice that each one
  of the 3 different ways that this event</span> <span m="207390">can happen
  have the same probability.</span></p><p><span m="210620">So these 3 outcomes
  are equally likely.</span></p><p><span m="214270">Finally, let us calculate a
  conditional probability.</span></p><p><span m="219390">And this is essentially
  the Bayes rule.</span></p><p><span m="222420">Suppose that we were told that
  there was exactly one head.</span></p><p><span m="226250">So in particular,
  the blue event has occurred.</span></p><p><span m="230590">And we're
  interested in the probability that the first</span> <span m="233820">toss is
  heads, which corresponds</span> <span m="237940">to this event
  here.</span></p><p><span m="240080">These are all the outcomes in which the
  first</span> <span m="242710">toss is equal to heads.</span></p><p><span
  m="246140">So given that the blue event happened, what is the</span> <span
  m="249350">probability that the green event happens?</span></p><p><span
  m="253710">You can guess the answer, that it should be 1/3.</span></p><p><span
  m="256579">Why is that?</span></p><p><span m="257870">Each one of these blue
  outcomes has the same</span> <span m="262420">probability.</span></p><p><span
  m="263440">So when you condition on the blue outcome having happened,</span>
  <span m="267250">the conditional probability of each one of</span> <span
  m="269710">these should be 1/3.</span></p><p><span m="271810">So given that
  the blue outcome happened, there's probability</span> <span m="275100">1/3
  that this particular one has happened.</span></p><p><span m="280010">And this
  is the only one that makes the green event happen.</span></p><p><span
  m="283450">But let us see if we can derive this</span> <span m="285550">answer
  in a formal manner.</span></p><p><span m="287330">Let's see if we're going to
  get 1/3.</span></p><p><span m="289740">We use the definition of conditional
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="292520">The conditional probability is
  the ratio, first, of the</span> <span m="296360">probability that both events
  happen, divided by the</span> <span m="303920">probability of the conditioning
  event, which is</span> <span m="307610">the probability of 1
  head.</span></p><p><span m="314620">Now, the probability of both events
  happening.</span></p><p><span m="318620">That we have exactly one head and the
  first toss is heads.</span></p><p><span m="322910">This is the intersection of
  the blue event and the green</span> <span m="325950">event which can happen
  only in this particular outcome,</span> <span m="329150">namely the sequence
  heads, tails, tails.</span></p><p><span m="332360">And has probability p times
  (1 minus p) squared.</span></p><p><span m="337230">The denominator is
  something that we have already</span> <span
  m="339840">calculated.</span></p><p><span m="340680">It's 3p times (1 minus p)
  squared.</span></p><p><span m="343930">And so the final answer is 1/3 as we
  had guessed.</span></p><p><span m="351030">Let me now make a few comments
  about this particular example.</span></p><p><span m="356100">This particular
  example is pretty special in the</span> <span m="359310">following
  respect.</span></p><p><span m="361400">We have that of the probability of H2,
  heads in</span> <span m="366375">the second toss, given that the first one was
  heads, is</span> <span m="369610">equal to p.</span></p><p><span
  m="371190">And the same is true for the conditional probability of</span>
  <span m="375100">heads in the second toss given that the first one was
  tails.</span></p><p><span m="382390">In other words, our beliefs about what
  may happen in the</span> <span m="386540">second toss remain the
  same.</span></p><p><span m="389130">There's a probability, p, of obtaining
  heads no matter what</span> <span m="393690">happened in the first
  toss.</span></p><p><span m="395900">Telling you the result of the first toss
  doesn't change your</span> <span m="398880">beliefs about what may happen, and
  with what probability, in</span> <span m="403450">the second
  toss.</span></p><p><span m="404930">And if you were to calculate the
  unconditional probability</span> <span m="408470">of heads in the second toss,
  what you would get using the</span> <span m="414310">total probability theorem
  would be the following.</span></p><p><span m="417370">It's probability of
  heads in the first toss times the</span> <span m="420450">probability of heads
  in the second, given heads in the</span> <span m="424330">first, plus the
  probability of tails in the first toss times</span> <span m="430710">the
  probability of heads in the second toss, given tails</span> <span
  m="434900">in the first.</span></p><p><span m="436320">And if you do the
  algebra, this turns out to</span> <span m="439910">be equal to p
  again.</span></p><p><span m="443560">So the unconditional probability of heads
  in the</span> <span m="446660">second toss turns out to be the same as the
  conditional</span> <span m="450180">probabilities.</span></p><p><span
  m="451500">Again, knowing what happened in the first toss doesn't</span> <span
  m="455000">change your beliefs about the second toss, which were</span> <span
  m="458780">associated with this particular probability, p.</span></p><p><span
  m="461890">So what we're going to do next is to generalize this special</span>
  <span m="466490">situation by giving a definition of independence of</span>
  <span m="470190">events, and then discuss various properties and</span> <span
  m="474920">concepts associated with independence.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
