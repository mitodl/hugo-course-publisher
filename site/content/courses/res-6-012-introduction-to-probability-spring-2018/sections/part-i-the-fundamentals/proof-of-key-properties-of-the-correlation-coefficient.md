title: Proof of Key Properties of the Correlation Coefficient
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='570'>In this segment, we justify some of the property is
  that</span> <span m='3350'>the correlation coefficient that we</span> <span
  m='5230'>claimed a little earlier.</span> </p><p><span m='7780'>The most
  important properties of the correlation coefficient</span> <span
  m='10560'>lies between minus 1 and plus 1.</span> </p><p><span m='13780'>We
  will prove this property for the special case where we</span> <span
  m='16950'>have random variables with zero means and unit variances.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20950'>So standard deviations are also 1, so most of the
  terms</span> <span m='24670'>here disappear and the correlation coefficient
  is</span> <span m='27560'>simply the expected value of X times Y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='30690'>We will show that in this special case the
  expected</span> <span m='33280'>value of X times Y lies between minus 1 and
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='37370'>But the proof of this fact remains valid with
  a little</span> <span m='42630'>bit of more algebra along similar lines</span>
  <span m='45790'>for the general case.</span> </p><p><span m='48501'>What we
  will do is we will consider this quantity here</span> <span m='53350'>and
  expand this quadratic and write it as</span> <span m='57200'>expected value of
  X squared.</span> </p><p><span m='59790'>Then there's a cross term, which is
  minus 2 rho, the</span> <span m='63160'>expected value of X times Y, plus rho
  squared, expected</span> <span m='70070'>value of Y squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='73560'>Now since we assume that the random variables have 0
  mean,</span> <span m='77840'>this is the same as the variance and we assume
  that</span> <span m='80370'>the variance is 1, so this term here is equal to
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='85100'>Now, the expected value of X times Y is the
  same as the</span> <span m='89050'>correlation coefficient in this
  case.</span> </p><p><span m='91170'>So we have minus 2 rho squared and
  from</span> <span m='95190'>here we have rho squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='96870'>And by the previous argument, again this quantity, according</span>
  <span m='100030'>to our assumptions, is equal to 1 so we're left with
  this</span> <span m='103740'>expression, which is 1 minus rho squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='109830'>Now, notice that this is the expectation of a
  non-negative</span> <span m='112979'>random variable so this quantity here
  must be</span> <span m='117210'>non-negative.</span> </p><p><span
  m='118560'>Therefore, 1 minus rho squared is non-negative, which means</span>
  <span m='126470'>that rho squared is less than or equal to 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='131850'>And that's the same as requiring that rho lie
  between</span> <span m='135230'>minus 1 and plus 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='137820'>And so we have established this important property, at</span> <span
  m='141310'>least for the special case of 0 means and unit variances.</span>
  </p><p><span m='144150'>But as I mentioned, it remains valid more
  generally.</span> </p><p><span m='148250'>Now let us look at an extreme case,
  when the absolute value</span> <span m='152920'>of rho is equal to 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155410'>What happens in this case?</span> </p><p><span
  m='156986'>In that case, this term is 0 and this implies that the</span> <span
  m='163410'>expected value of the square of this random variable is</span>
  <span m='166870'>equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='168250'>Now here we have a
  non-negative random variable,</span> <span m='171770'>and its expected value
  is 0, which means that when we</span> <span m='175390'>calculate the expected
  value of this there will be no</span> <span m='178470'>positive contributions
  and so the only contributions must be</span> <span m='182710'>equal to
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='184000'>This means that X minus rho Y has to be
  equal to 0 with</span> <span m='189100'>probability 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='191860'>So X is going to be equal to rho times Y and this will</span> <span
  m='197260'>happen with essential certainty.</span> </p><p><span m='199700'>Now
  also because the absolute value overall is equal to 1,</span> <span
  m='203250'>this means that we have either X equal to Y or X equals to</span>
  <span m='210490'>minus Y, in case rho is equal to minus 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='215210'>So we see that if the correlation coefficient has an</span> <span
  m='218100'>absolute value of 1, then X and Y are related to each</span> <span
  m='222280'>other according to a simple linear relation, and it's an</span>
  <span m='227620'>extreme form of dependence between</span> <span
  m='229579'>the two random variables.</span> </p><p></p>
