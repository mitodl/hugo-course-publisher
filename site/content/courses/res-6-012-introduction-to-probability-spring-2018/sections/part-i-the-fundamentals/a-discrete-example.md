  <p><span m="760">Let us now move from the abstract to the
  concrete.</span></p><p><span m="4940">Recall the example that we discussed
  earlier where we</span> <span m="7590">have two rolls of a tetrahedral
  die.</span></p><p><span m="10200">So there are 16 possible outcomes</span>
  <span m="12380">illustrated in this diagram.</span></p><p><span m="15070">To
  continue, now we need to specify a probability law,</span> <span
  m="19370">some kind of probability assignment.</span></p><p><span m="22070">To
  keep things simple, we're going to make the assumption</span> <span
  m="25620">that the 16 possible outcomes are all equally
  likely.</span></p><p><span m="30390">And each outcome has a probability of 1
  over 16.</span></p><p><span m="35570">Given this assumption, we will now
  proceed to calculate</span> <span m="38870">certain
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="41330">Let us look first at the
  probability that X, which</span> <span m="46190">stands the result of the
  first roll, is equal to 1.</span></p><p><span m="50790">The way to calculate
  this probability is to identify</span> <span m="54590">what exactly that event
  is in our picture of the sample</span> <span m="59330">space, and then
  calculate.</span></p><p><span m="62130">The event that X is equal to 1 can
  happen in four different</span> <span m="66600">ways that correspond to these
  four particular outcomes.</span></p><p><span m="72930">Each one of these
  outcomes has a probability of 1 over 16.</span></p><p><span m="77330">The
  probability of this event is the sum of the</span> <span
  m="81470">probabilities of the outcomes that it contains.</span></p><p><span
  m="84130">So it is 4 times 1 over 16, equal to one fourth.</span></p><p><span
  m="92740">Let now Z stand for the smaller of the two numbers</span> <span
  m="97780">that came up in our two rolls.</span></p><p><span m="100550">So for
  example, if X is 2 and Y is equal to 3, then Z is</span> <span
  m="109460">equal to 2, which is the smaller of the two.</span></p><p><span
  m="113860">Let us try to calculate the probability that the smaller</span>
  <span m="117400">of the two outcomes is equal to 4.</span></p><p><span
  m="121050">Now for the smaller of the two outcomes to be equal to 4, we</span>
  <span m="125380">must have that both X and Y are equal to
  4.</span></p><p><span m="130370">So this outcome here is the only way that
  this particular</span> <span m="135000">event can happen.</span></p><p><span
  m="137030">Since there's only one outcome that makes the event happen,</span>
  <span m="140940">the probability of this event is the probability of
  that</span> <span m="143760">outcome and is equal to 1 over
  16.</span></p><p><span m="149310">For another example, let's calculate the
  probability that</span> <span m="152760">the minimum is equal to
  2.</span></p><p><span m="155220">What does it mean that the minimum is equal
  to 2?</span></p><p><span m="157670">It means that one of the dice resulted in
  a 2, and the other</span> <span m="162490">die resulted in a number that's 2
  or larger.</span></p><p><span m="166100">So we could have both equal to
  2.</span></p><p><span m="168850">We could have X equal to 2, but Y
  larger.</span></p><p><span m="173340">Or we could have Y equal to 2 and X
  something larger.</span></p><p><span m="179100">This green event, this green
  set, is the set of all</span> <span m="183360">outcomes for which the minimum
  of the two</span> <span m="186770">rolls is equal to 2.</span></p><p><span
  m="188300">There's a total of five such outcomes.</span></p><p><span
  m="191060">Each one of them has probably 1 over 16.</span></p><p><span
  m="194610">And we have discussed that for finite sets, the probability</span>
  <span m="198480">of a finite set is the sum of the probabilities of the</span>
  <span m="202370">elements of that set.</span></p><p><span m="203780">So we
  have five elements here, each one with</span> <span m="206720">probability 1
  over 16.</span></p><p><span m="208760">And this is the answer to this
  problem.</span></p><p><span m="213210">This particular example that we saw
  here is a special case</span> <span m="219130">of what is called a discrete
  uniform law.</span></p><p><span m="222920">In a discrete uniform law, we have
  a sample</span> <span m="225770">space which is finite.</span></p><p><span
  m="230630">And it has n elements.</span></p><p><span m="233260">And we assume
  that these n elements are equally likely.</span></p><p><span m="238030">Now
  since the probability of omega, the probability of the</span> <span
  m="241100">entire sample space, is equal to 1, this means that each one</span>
  <span m="246170">of these elements must have probability 1 over
  n.</span></p><p><span m="250980">That's the only way that the sum of the
  probabilities of</span> <span m="254220">the different outcomes would be equal
  to 1 as required by</span> <span m="258610">the normalization
  axiom.</span></p><p><span m="261329">Consider now some subset of the sample
  space, an event A</span> <span m="265630">that, exactly k
  elements.</span></p><p><span m="267840">What is the probability of the set
  A?</span></p><p><span m="271320">It's the sum of the probabilities of its
  elements.</span></p><p><span m="274980">There are k
  elements.</span></p><p><span m="277340">And each one of them has a probability
  of 1 over n.</span></p><p><span m="281760">And this way we can find the
  probability of the set A.</span></p><p><span m="285570">So when we have a
  discrete uniform probability law, we</span> <span m="291070">can calculate
  probabilities by simply counting the number of</span> <span
  m="295110">elements of omega, which is n, finding the number n, and</span>
  <span m="299120">counting the number of elements of the set A. That's</span>
  <span m="302510">the reason why counting will turn out to be</span> <span
  m="304740">an important skill.</span></p><p><span m="306110">And there will be
  a whole lecture devoted to this</span> <span m="309740">particular
  topic.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
