title: Independence of Random Variables
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="520">We now come to a very important concept, the concept</span>
  <span m="4090">of independence of random variables.</span></p><p><span
  m="7010">We are already familiar with the notion of independence of</span>
  <span m="9930">two events.</span></p><p><span m="11190">We have the
  mathematical definition, and the</span> <span m="13940">interpretation is that
  conditional probabilities are</span> <span m="17550">the same as unconditional
  ones.</span></p><p><span m="20170">Intuitively, when you are told that B
  occurred, this does not</span> <span m="25770">change your beliefs about A,
  and so the conditional</span> <span m="29030">probability of A is the same as
  the unconditional</span> <span m="32290">probability.</span></p><p><span
  m="33960">We have a similar definition of independence of a random</span>
  <span m="37000">variable and an event A. The mathematical definition is</span>
  <span m="42410">that event A and the event that X takes on a specific</span>
  <span m="48610">value, that these two events are independent in the</span>
  <span m="52880">ordinary sense.</span></p><p><span m="54140">So the
  probability of both of these events happening is the</span> <span
  m="57280">product of their individual probabilities.</span></p><p><span
  m="59930">But we require this to be true for all values of little
  x.</span></p><p><span m="66410">Intuitively, if I tell you that A occurred,
  this is not</span> <span m="73440">going to change the distribution of the
  random</span> <span m="76600">variable x.</span></p><p><span m="82730">This is
  one interpretation of what independence means in</span> <span m="86730">this
  context.</span></p><p><span m="87970">And this has to be true for all values
  of little x, that</span> <span m="94570">is, when [the]</span> <span
  m="95390">event occurs, the probabilities of any</span> <span
  m="98550">particular little x [are]</span> <span m="100280">going to be the
  same as the original unconditional</span> <span
  m="103400">probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="104940">We also have a
  symmetrical interpretation.</span></p><p><span m="108020">If I tell you the
  value of X, then the conditional</span> <span m="112440">probability of event
  A is not going to change.</span></p><p><span m="117140">It's going to be the
  same as the unconditional probability.</span></p><p><span m="120860">And
  again, this is going to be the case for all values of X.</span></p><p><span
  m="126260">So, no matter what they tell you about X, your beliefs</span> <span
  m="129780">about A are not going to change.</span></p><p><span m="133820">We
  can now move and define the notion of independence of two</span> <span
  m="137100">random variables.</span></p><p><span m="139060">The mathematical
  definition is that the event that X takes on</span> <span m="143160">a value
  little x and the event that Y takes on a value little</span> <span
  m="147180">y, these two events are independent, and this is true</span> <span
  m="151490">for all possible values of little x and little
  y.</span></p><p><span m="156610">In PMF notation, this relation here can
  be</span> <span m="160420">written in this form.</span></p><p><span
  m="162020">And basically, the joint PMF factors out as a product of</span>
  <span m="167700">the marginal PMFs of the two random
  variables.</span></p><p><span m="171440">Again, this relation has to be true
  for all possible little x</span> <span m="175890">and little
  y.</span></p><p><span m="177630">What does independence
  mean?</span></p><p><span m="179990">When I tell you the value of y, and no
  matter what value I</span> <span m="186880">tell you, your beliefs about X
  will not change.</span></p><p><span m="192010">So that the conditional PMF of
  X given Y is going to be the</span> <span m="198440">same as the unconditional
  PMF of X. And this has to be true</span> <span m="204810">for any values of
  the arguments of these PMFs.</span></p><p><span m="213120">There is also a
  symmetric interpretation, which is that</span> <span m="217190">the
  conditional PMF of Y given X is going to be the same as</span> <span
  m="224930">the unconditional PMF of Y. We have the symmetric</span> <span
  m="229250">interpretation because, as we can see from this definition,</span>
  <span m="232710">X and Y have symmetric roles.</span></p><p><span
  m="236230">Finally, we can define the notion of independence of</span> <span
  m="239310">multiple random variables by a similar relation.</span></p><p><span
  m="243880">Here, the definition is for the case of three random</span> <span
  m="247020">variables, but you can imagine how the definition for any</span>
  <span m="251380">finite number of random variables will go.</span></p><p><span
  m="254150">Namely, the joint PMF of all the random variables can be</span>
  <span m="258360">expressed as the product of the</span> <span
  m="261050">corresponding marginal PMFs.</span></p><p><span m="264510">What is
  the intuitive interpretation of</span> <span m="266380">independence
  here?</span></p><p><span m="268270">It means that information about some of
  the random</span> <span m="271320">variables will not change your beliefs, the
  probabilities,</span> <span m="275900">about the remaining random
  variables.</span></p><p><span m="278980">Any conditional probabilities and any
  conditional PMFs will</span> <span m="283600">be the same as the unconditional
  ones.</span></p><p><span m="287590">In the real world, independence models
  situations</span> <span m="291530">where each of the random variables is
  generated in a</span> <span m="296110">decoupled manner, in a separate
  probabilistic</span> <span m="298960">experiment.</span></p><p><span
  m="299940">And these probabilistic experiments do not interact</span> <span
  m="302970">with each other and have no common sources of
  uncertainty.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
