title: Independence of Random Variables Versus Independence of Events
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="460">By now, we have defined the notion of independence of</span>
  <span m="4310">events and also the notion of</span> <span
  m="6480">independence of random variables.</span></p><p><span m="9080">The two
  definitions look fairly similar, but the</span> <span m="12130">details are
  not exactly the same, because the two</span> <span m="14820">definitions refer
  to different situations.</span></p><p><span m="18190">For two events, we know
  what it means for them to be</span> <span
  m="21370">independent.</span></p><p><span m="22420">The probability of their
  intersection is the product of</span> <span m="25250">their individual
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="27490">Now, to make a relation with
  random variables, we introduce</span> <span m="32240">the so-called indicator
  random variables.</span></p><p><span m="35430">So for example, the random
  variable X is defined to be</span> <span m="38910">equal to 1 if event A
  occurs and to be equal</span> <span m="43660">to 0 if event [A]</span> <span
  m="45870">does not occur.</span></p><p><span m="47640">And there is a similar
  definition for random variable</span> <span m="50660">Y.</span></p><p><span
  m="51720">In particular, the probability that random variable X takes</span>
  <span m="55130">the value of 1, this is the probability</span> <span
  m="57260">that event A occurs.</span></p><p><span m="61960">It turns out that
  the independence of the two</span> <span m="65610">events, A and B, is
  equivalent to the independence of the two</span> <span m="70670">indicator
  random variables.</span></p><p><span m="73789">And there is a similar
  statement, which</span> <span m="75780">is true more
  generally.</span></p><p><span m="77730">That is, n events are independent if
  and only if the</span> <span m="82450">associated n indicator random variables
  are independent.</span></p><p><span m="88520">This is a useful statement,
  because it allows us to</span> <span m="93670">sometimes, instead of
  manipulating events, to</span> <span m="96950">manipulate random variables,
  and vice versa.</span></p><p><span m="99810">And depending on the context, one
  maybe</span> <span m="102100">easier than the other.</span></p><p><span
  m="103950">Now, the intuitive content is that events A and B are</span> <span
  m="107289">independent if the occurrence of event A does not change</span>
  <span m="110320">your beliefs about B. And in terms of random variables,
  one</span> <span m="114720">random variable taking a certain value, which
  indicates</span> <span m="118110">whether event A has occurred or not does not
  give you any</span> <span m="121580">information about the other random
  variable, which would</span> <span m="124480">tell you whether event B has
  occurred or not.</span></p><p><span m="129720">It is instructive now to go
  through the derivation of this</span> <span m="133430">fact, at least for the
  case of two events, because it gives</span> <span m="138030">us perhaps some
  additional understanding about the</span> <span m="141050">precise content of
  the definitions we have</span> <span m="143710">introduced.</span></p><p><span
  m="145440">So let us suppose that random variables X and Y are</span> <span
  m="148850">independent.</span></p><p><span m="150070">What does that
  mean?</span></p><p><span m="151320">Independence means that the joint PMF of
  the two random</span> <span m="154680">variables, X and Y, factors as a
  product of the corresponding</span> <span m="160160">marginal
  PMFs.</span></p><p><span m="162480">And this factorization must be true no
  matter what arguments</span> <span m="168670">we use inside the joint
  PMF.</span></p><p><span m="172840">And the combination of X and Y in this
  instance have a total</span> <span m="177030">of four possible
  values.</span></p><p><span m="180240">These are the combinations of zeroes
  and</span> <span m="182130">ones that we can form.</span></p><p><span
  m="183740">And for this reason, we have a total of four
  equations.</span></p><p><span m="187420">These four equalities are what is
  required for X and Y to be</span> <span
  m="191510">independent.</span></p><p><span m="193130">So suppose that this is
  true, that the random variables are</span> <span
  m="196780">independent.</span></p><p><span m="198320">Let us take this first
  relation and write it in</span> <span m="201329">probability
  notation.</span></p><p><span m="203860">The random variable X taking the value
  of 1, that's the</span> <span m="206710">same as event A
  occurring.</span></p><p><span m="209740">And random variable Y taking the
  value of 1, that's the</span> <span m="213329">same as event B
  occurring.</span></p><p><span m="216400">So the joint PMF evaluated at 1, 1 is
  the probability that</span> <span m="220960">events A and B both
  occur.</span></p><p><span m="224170">On the other side of the equation, we
  have the</span> <span m="226040">probability that X is equal to 1, which is
  the probability</span> <span m="228860">that A occurs, and similarly, the
  probability that B occurs.</span></p><p><span m="233980">But if this is true,
  then by definition, A and B are</span> <span m="239690">independent
  events.</span></p><p><span m="242910">So we have verified one direction of
  this statement.</span></p><p><span m="245840">If the random variables are
  independent, then events A and</span> <span m="249310">B are
  independent.</span></p><p><span m="251430">Now, we would like to verify the
  reverse statement.</span></p><p><span m="255180">So suppose that events A and
  B are independent.</span></p><p><span m="259170">In that case, this relation
  is true.</span></p><p><span m="263560">And as we just argued, this relation is
  the same as this</span> <span m="268060">relation but just written in
  different notation.</span></p><p><span m="271650">So we have shown that if A
  and B are independent, this</span> <span m="275500">relation will be
  true.</span></p><p><span m="277890">But how about the remaining three
  relations?</span></p><p><span m="280530">We have more work to
  do.</span></p><p><span m="284400">Here's how we can
  proceed.</span></p><p><span m="286870">If A and B are independent, we have
  shown some time ago that</span> <span m="292260">events A and B complement
  will also be independent.</span></p><p><span m="298670">Intuitively, A doesn't
  tell you anything about</span> <span m="301560">B occuring or
  not.</span></p><p><span m="303330">So A does not tell you anything about
  whether B</span> <span m="306270">complement will occur or
  not.</span></p><p><span m="309060">Now, these two events being independent, by
  the definition</span> <span m="312200">of independence, we have that the
  probability of A</span> <span m="315640">intersection with B complement is the
  product of the</span> <span m="319190">probabilities of A and of B
  complement.</span></p><p><span m="326250">And then we realize that this
  equality, if written in PMF</span> <span m="331620">notation, corresponds
  exactly to this equation here.</span></p><p><span m="337409">Event A
  corresponds to X taking the value of 1, event B</span> <span
  m="341760">complement corresponds to the event that Y takes</span> <span
  m="344770">the value of 0.</span></p><p><span m="347830">By a similar
  argument, B and A complement will be</span> <span
  m="352980">independent.</span></p><p><span m="355780">And we translate that
  into probability notation.</span></p><p><span m="369850">And then we translate
  this equality into PMF notation.</span></p><p><span m="374250">And we get this
  relation.</span></p><p><span m="376380">Finally, using the same property that
  we used to do</span> <span m="381880">the first step here, we have that A
  complement and B</span> <span m="386270">complement are also
  independent.</span></p><p><span m="388820">And by following the same line of
  reasoning, this implies the</span> <span m="392170">fourth relation as
  well.</span></p><p><span m="395300">So we have verified that if events A and B
  are</span> <span m="398310">independent, then we can argue that all of these
  four</span> <span m="401590">equations will be true.</span></p><p><span
  m="403970">And therefore, random variables X and Y will also be</span> <span
  m="407830">independent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
