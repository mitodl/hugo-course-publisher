transcript: >-
  <p><span m="1400">We end this lecture sequence by stepping back to
  discuss</span> <span m="4860">what probability theory really is and what
  exactly is the</span> <span m="9020">meaning of the word
  probability.</span></p><p><span m="11990">In the most narrow view, probability
  theory is just a</span> <span m="14990">branch of
  mathematics.</span></p><p><span m="16590">We start with some
  axioms.</span></p><p><span m="18590">We consider models that satisfy these
  axioms, and we</span> <span m="22080">establish some consequences, which are
  the</span> <span m="24410">theorems of this theory.</span></p><p><span
  m="27110">You could do all that without ever asking the question of</span>
  <span m="30730">what the word &quot;probability&quot; really
  means.</span></p><p><span m="34170">Yet, one of the theorems of probability
  theory, that we</span> <span m="37730">will see later in this class, is that
  probabilities can be</span> <span m="41900">interpreted as frequencies, very
  loosely speaking.</span></p><p><span m="46250">If I have a fair coin, and I
  toss it infinitely many times,</span> <span m="50120">then the fraction of
  heads that I will</span> <span m="52580">observe will be one
  half.</span></p><p><span m="55170">In this sense, the probability of an event,
  A, can be</span> <span m="58880">interpreted as the frequency with which event
  A will occur</span> <span m="63160">in an infinite number of repetitions of
  the experiment.</span></p><p><span m="67880">But is this all there
  is?</span></p><p><span m="70780">If we're dealing with coin tosses, it makes
  sense to</span> <span m="73090">think of probabilities as
  frequencies.</span></p><p><span m="75410">But consider a statement such as the
  &quot;current president of</span> <span m="80230">my country will be reelected
  in the next election with</span> <span m="83620">probability
  0.7&quot;.</span></p><p><span m="86390">It's hard to think of this number,
  0.7, as a frequency.</span></p><p><span m="90180">It does not make sense to
  think of infinitely many</span> <span m="93020">repetitions of the next
  election.</span></p><p><span m="95789">In cases like this, and in many others,
  it is better to</span> <span m="99750">think of probabilities as just some way
  of</span> <span m="103210">describing our beliefs.</span></p><p><span
  m="105300">And if you're a betting person, probabilities can be</span> <span
  m="108920">thought of as some numerical guidance into what kinds of</span>
  <span m="112460">bets you might be willing to make.</span></p><p><span
  m="116780">But now if we think of probabilities as beliefs, you</span> <span
  m="121440">can run into the argument that, well, beliefs are</span> <span
  m="124590">subjective.</span></p><p><span m="125820">Isn't probability theory
  supposed to be an objective</span> <span m="129860">part of math and
  science?</span></p><p><span m="132270">Is probability theory just an exercise
  in subjectivity?</span></p><p><span m="136260">Well, not
  quite.</span></p><p><span m="138540">There's more to it.</span></p><p><span
  m="140250">Probability, at the minimum, gives us some rules for</span> <span
  m="144210">thinking systematically about uncertain
  situations.</span></p><p><span m="149310">And if it happens that our
  probability model, our</span> <span m="152450">subjective beliefs, have some
  relation with the real world,</span> <span m="156380">then probability theory
  can be a very useful tool for making</span> <span m="159910">predictions and
  decisions that apply to the real world.</span></p><p><span m="165000">Now,
  whether your predictions and decisions will be any good</span> <span
  m="168750">will depend on whether you have chosen a good
  model.</span></p><p><span m="173120">Have you chosen a model that's provides a
  good enough</span> <span m="175640">representation of the real
  world?</span></p><p><span m="179079">How do you make sure that this is the
  case?</span></p><p><span m="181660">There's a whole field, the field of
  statistics, whose</span> <span m="185020">purpose is to complement probability
  theory by using</span> <span m="189270">data to come up with good
  models.</span></p><p><span m="192750">And so we have the following diagram
  that summarizes the</span> <span m="197340">relation between the real world,
  statistics, and</span> <span m="200200">probability.</span></p><p><span
  m="201250">The real world generates data.</span></p><p><span m="203920">The
  field of statistics and inference uses these data to</span> <span
  m="207230">come up with probabilistic models.</span></p><p><span
  m="209680">Once we have a probabilistic model, we use probability</span> <span
  m="212720">theory and the analysis tools that it provides to
  us.</span></p><p><span m="216390">And the results that we get from this
  analysis lead to</span> <span m="220360">predictions and decisions about the
  real world.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
