title: The Sum of Independent Discrete Random Variables
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='710'>The subject of this segment is the calculation of the PMF
  of</span> <span m='4010'>the sum of two independent, discrete random
  variables.</span> </p><p><span m='9040'>This is the simplest example of a
  function of two random</span> <span m='11750'>variables, a function of the
  form of g of X and Y, where</span> <span m='16050'>the function g happens to
  be just the</span> <span m='18480'>sum of the two arguments.</span>
  </p><p><span m='21080'>This is a very important example, because there
  are</span> <span m='23140'>many situations where random variables get</span>
  <span m='25340'>added to each other.</span> </p><p><span m='26960'>We work
  with discrete random variables as a warm up.</span> </p><p><span m='29890'>And
  later, we will consider the case of</span> <span m='32020'>continuous random
  variables.</span> </p><p><span m='34170'>So suppose that we know the PMFs of X
  and Y and that we</span> <span m='38020'>want to compute the probability that
  the sum is</span> <span m='40720'>equal to 3.</span> </p><p><span m='42250'>It
  always helps to have a picture.</span> </p><p><span m='44840'>The sum of X and
  Y will be equal to 3.</span> </p><p><span m='49110'>This is an event that can
  happen in many ways.</span> </p><p><span m='51720'>For example, x could be 3
  and Y could be 0, or X could be 1</span> <span m='56010'>and Y equal to
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='58910'>The probability of the event of interest,
  that the sum is</span> <span m='61530'>equal to 3, is going to be the sum of
  the probabilities of</span> <span m='64800'>all the different ways that this
  event can happen.</span> </p><p><span m='68390'>So it is going to be a sum of
  various terms.</span> </p><p><span m='72060'>And the typical term would be the
  probability, let's say of</span> <span m='75800'>this outcome, which is that X
  is equal to 0 and</span> <span m='80210'>Y is equal to 3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='82370'>Another typical term in the sum will be the probability of</span>
  <span m='85930'>this outcome here, the probability that X is equal to</span>
  <span m='89270'>1, Y is equal to 2, and so on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='95479'>Now, here comes an important step.</span> </p><p><span
  m='98350'>Because we have assumed that X and Y are independent, the</span>
  <span m='101560'>probability of these two events happening is the</span> <span
  m='103910'>product of the probabilities of each one of these events.</span>
  </p><p><span m='108180'>So it is the product of the probability that X is
  equal to</span> <span m='111570'>0, where now I'm using PMF notation, times
  the</span> <span m='115440'>probability that Y is equal to 3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='118600'>Similarly, the next term is the probability that X
  is</span> <span m='121720'>equal to 1 times the probability that</span> <span
  m='124190'>Y is equal to 2.</span> </p><p><span m='125900'>Again, we can do
  this because we are assuming that our two</span> <span m='129220'>random
  variables are independent of each other.</span> </p><p><span m='132510'>Now,
  let us generalize.</span> </p><p><span m='135846'>In the general case, the
  probability that the sum takes</span> <span m='143260'>on a particular value
  little z can be calculated as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='148610'>We look
  at all the different ways that the sum of little z</span> <span m='151420'>can
  be obtained.</span> </p><p><span m='152980'>One way is that the random
  variable X takes on a specific</span> <span m='156920'>value little X. And at
  the same time, the random variable</span> <span m='160480'>Y takes the value
  that's needed so that the sum of the</span> <span m='164890'>two is equal to
  little Z. For a given value of little X, we</span> <span m='172200'>have a
  particular way that the sum is equal to Z. And this</span> <span
  m='176400'>particular way has a certain probability.</span> </p><p><span
  m='179579'>But little X could be anything.</span> </p><p><span m='181660'>And
  different choices of little x give us different</span> <span m='184730'>ways
  that the event of interest can happen.</span> </p><p><span m='187640'>So we
  add those probabilities over all possible X's.</span> </p><p><span
  m='192740'>And then we proceed as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='195800'>We
  invoke independence of X and Y to derive this</span> <span
  m='198630'>probability as a product of two probabilities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='201350'>And then we use PMF notation instead of probability</span> <span
  m='205560'>notation to obtain this expression here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='213010'>This formula is called the convolution formula.</span> </p><p><span
  m='219540'>It is the convolution of two PMFs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='222320'>What convolution means is that somebody gives us the PMF of</span>
  <span m='227420'>one random variable, gives us also the PMF of</span> <span
  m='231079'>another random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='232640'>And when we
  say we're given the PMF, it means we're given</span> <span m='235540'>the
  values of the PMFs for all the possible choices of little</span> <span
  m='239360'>X and little y, the arguments of the two PMFs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='242570'>Then the convolution formula does a certain calculation and</span>
  <span m='246790'>spits out now a new PMF, which is the PMF of the
  random</span> <span m='251690'>variable Z. Let's now take a closer look at
  what it takes</span> <span m='257459'>to carry out of the calculations
  involved in this</span> <span m='260350'>convolution formula.</span>
  </p><p><span m='262450'>Let's proceed by a simple example that will
  illustrate</span> <span m='265210'>the methodology.</span> </p><p><span
  m='266140'>We're given two PMFs of two random variables.</span> </p><p><span
  m='269410'>And assuming that they are independent, the PMF of their</span>
  <span m='272159'>sum is determined by this formula here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='275400'>And we want to see what those terms in this</span> <span
  m='277920'>summation would be.</span> </p><p><span m='279500'>Suppose that
  we're interested in the probability that the</span> <span m='281640'>sum is
  equal to 3.</span> </p><p><span m='283220'>Now, the sum is going to be equal
  to 3.</span> </p><p><span m='286140'>This can happen in several ways.</span>
  </p><p><span m='288330'>We could have X equal to 1 and and Y equal to
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='294580'>This combination is one way that the</span>
  <span m='296750'>sum of 3 can be obtained.</span> </p><p><span m='298700'>And
  that combination has a probability of 1/3 times 3/6.</span> </p><p><span
  m='303030'>And that would be one of the terms in this summation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='306010'>Another way that the sum of 3 can be obtained is by
  having X</span> <span m='309320'>equal to 4 and y equal to minus 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='312630'>And by multiplying this probability 2/3 with 2/6,
  we</span> <span m='317750'>obtain another contribution to this
  summation.</span> </p><p><span m='321900'>However, keeping track of these
  correspondences here can</span> <span m='325690'>become a little complicated
  if we have richer our PMFs.</span> </p><p><span m='329970'>So an alternative
  way of arranging the calculation is</span> <span m='333460'>the
  following.</span> </p><p><span m='334940'>Let us take the PMF of Y, flip it
  along this vertical axis.</span> </p><p><span m='341930'>So these two terms
  would go to the left side, and this term</span> <span m='344870'>will go to
  the right hand side.</span> </p><p><span m='346860'>And then draw it
  underneath the PMF of X.</span> </p><p><span m='349850'>This is what we
  obtain.</span> </p><p><span m='352150'>Then let us take this drawing here and
  shift it to</span> <span m='356500'>the right by 3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='358590'>So the entry of minus 2 goes to 1, minus 1 goes to 2,</span> <span
  m='362140'>and 1 goes to 4.</span> </p><p><span m='363990'>So what have we
  accomplished by these two transformations?</span> </p><p><span
  m='368710'>Well, the term that had probability 3/6 and which were</span> <span
  m='376810'>to be multiplied with the probability 1/3 on that side,</span>
  <span m='381940'>now this 3/6 sits here.</span> </p><p><span m='385520'>So we
  have this correspondence.</span> </p><p><span m='388260'>And we need to
  multiply 1/3 by 3/6.</span> </p><p><span m='391850'>Similarly, the
  multiplication of 2/3 with 2/6 corresponds to</span> <span m='396170'>the
  multiplication of this probability here times the</span> <span
  m='399980'>probability of this term here.</span> </p><p><span m='403110'>So
  when the diagrams are arranged this way, then we</span> <span m='407100'>have
  a simpler job to do.</span> </p><p><span m='409320'>We look at corresponding
  terms, those that sit on top</span> <span m='413380'>of each other, multiply
  them, do that for all the possible</span> <span m='418150'>choices, and then
  add those products together.</span> </p><p><span m='422450'>And this is what
  we do if we're shifting by 3.</span> </p><p><span m='425430'>Now, if we wanted
  to find the probability that Z equal to 4,</span> <span m='429470'>we would be
  doing the same thing, except that this</span> <span m='432320'>diagram would
  need to be shifted by one more unit to</span> <span m='436270'>the right so
  that we have a total shift of 4.</span> </p><p><span m='440100'>So we just
  repeat this procedure for all possible</span> <span m='443500'>values of Z
  which corresponds to taking this diagram here</span> <span m='448540'>and
  shifting it progressively by different amounts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='452790'>This turns out to be a fairly simple and systematic way of</span>
  <span m='456680'>arranging the calculations, at least if you're</span> <span
  m='458830'>doing them by hand.</span> </p><p><span m='460430'>Of course, an
  alternative is to carry out the calculations</span> <span m='463920'>on a
  computer.</span> </p><p><span m='465040'>This is a pretty simple formula that
  is not hard to</span> <span m='469000'>implement on a computer.</span>
