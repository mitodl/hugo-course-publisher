title: The PDF of a Function of Multiple Random Variables
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='385'>In all of the examples that we have seen so far, we
  have</span> <span m='4180'>calculated the distribution of a random variable,
  Y, which is</span> <span m='8210'>defined as a function of another random
  variable, X.</span> </p><p><span m='11950'>What about the case where we define
  a random variable, Z,</span> <span m='15880'>as a function of multiple random
  variables?</span> </p><p><span m='19000'>For example, here is the
  function</span> <span m='20820'>of two random variables.</span> </p><p><span
  m='22170'>How can we find a distribution of Z?</span> </p><p><span
  m='24710'>The general methodology is exactly the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='27980'>We somehow calculate the CDF of the random variable Z and</span>
  <span m='32680'>then differentiate to find its PDF.</span> </p><p><span
  m='35340'>Let us illustrate this methodology</span> <span m='37160'>with a
  simple example.</span> </p><p><span m='39020'>So suppose that X and Y are
  independent random variables</span> <span m='43060'>and each one of them is
  uniform on the unit interval.</span> </p><p><span m='46780'>So their joint
  distribution is going to be a uniform PDF on</span> <span m='51340'>the unit
  square.</span> </p><p><span m='53210'>We're interested in the random variable,
  which is defined as</span> <span m='55790'>the ratio of Y divided by X.</span>
  </p><p><span m='59430'>So we will now calculate the CDF of Z and then</span>
  <span m='63220'>differentiate.</span> </p><p><span m='65019'>It is useful to
  work in terms of a diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='67670'>This is essentially
  our sample space, the unit square.</span> </p><p><span m='71340'>The PDF of X
  is 1 on the unit interval.</span> </p><p><span m='74950'>The PDF of Y is 1 on
  the unit interval.</span> </p><p><span m='77420'>Because of independence, the
  joint PDF is the product of</span> <span m='80350'>their individual
  PDFs.</span> </p><p><span m='82440'>So the joint PDF is equal to 1 throughout
  this unit square.</span> </p><p><span m='87580'>So now let us write an
  expression for the CDF of Z,</span> <span m='92890'>which, by definition, is
  the probability that the random</span> <span m='96280'>variable Z, which in
  our case is Y divided by X, is less</span> <span m='101789'>than or equal than
  a certain number, little z.</span> </p><p><span m='106680'>What is the
  probability of this event?</span> </p><p><span m='109310'>Let us consider a
  few different cases.</span> </p><p><span m='111539'>Suppose that z is
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='114310'>What is the probability that this
  ratio is negative?</span> </p><p><span m='117050'>Well, since X and Y are
  non-negative numbers, there's</span> <span m='120530'>no way that the ratio is
  going to be negative.</span> </p><p><span m='123220'>So if little z is a
  negative number, the probability of</span> <span m='129410'>this event is
  going to be equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='133160'>This is the easier
  case.</span> </p><p><span m='135170'>Now suppose that z is a positive
  number.</span> </p><p><span m='138610'>Let us draw a line that has a slope of
  little z.</span> </p><p><span m='146607'>y/z being less than or equal to
  little z is the same as</span> <span m='150670'>saying that y is less than or
  equal to little z times x.</span> </p><p><span m='156250'>This is the line on
  which y is equal to z times x.</span> </p><p><span m='162920'>So below that
  line, y is going to be less than or</span> <span m='165930'>equal to z times
  x.</span> </p><p><span m='168870'>So the event of interest is actually this
  triangle here.</span> </p><p><span m='173440'>And the probability of this
  event, since we're dealing</span> <span m='176090'>with a uniform distribution
  on the unit square, is just the</span> <span m='179500'>area of this
  triangle.</span> </p><p><span m='182440'>Now, since this line rises at slope
  z, this point here, this</span> <span m='186700'>intercept is at z.</span>
  </p><p><span m='189480'>And so the sides of the triangle are 1 and z.</span>
  </p><p><span m='193800'>And so this formula here gives us the value of the CDF
  for</span> <span m='199740'>the case where little z is positive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='205060'>And the same formula would also be true if z also
  were</span> <span m='208220'>equal to 0, in which case, we get 0
  probability.</span> </p><p><span m='212060'>But is this correct for all
  positive z's?</span> </p><p><span m='214880'>Well, not really.</span>
  </p><p><span m='216680'>This calculation was based on this picture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='218980'>And in this picture, this line intercepted this side
  of the</span> <span m='223600'>unit square.</span> </p><p><span m='225030'>And
  for that to happen, this slope must be less than or</span> <span
  m='230180'>equal to 1.</span> </p><p><span m='232000'>So this formula is only
  correct in the case where we</span> <span m='235380'>have a slope of less than
  or equal to 1.</span> </p><p><span m='238660'>And now we need to deal with the
  remaining case in which</span> <span m='243010'>little z is strictly larger
  than 1.</span> </p><p><span m='246940'>In this case, we get a somewhat
  different picture.</span> </p><p><span m='250210'>If we draw a line with
  slope, again, little z, because</span> <span m='259200'>little z is bigger
  than 1, it's going to intercept this</span> <span m='263140'>side of the
  rectangle.</span> </p><p><span m='265230'>Now, the event that Y/X is less than
  or equal to little z</span> <span m='268900'>is, again, the event that the
  pair, X, Y, lies below this</span> <span m='274110'>line that has a slope of
  z.</span> </p><p><span m='276290'>So all we need is to find the area of this
  region.</span> </p><p><span m='279909'>One way of finding the area of this
  region is to take the</span> <span m='282690'>area of the entire unit square,
  which is equal to 1,</span> <span m='286840'>and subtract the area of this
  triangle.</span> </p><p><span m='289730'>What is the area of this
  triangle?</span> </p><p><span m='292120'>Well, since this line has a slope of
  z, in order for it to</span> <span m='295580'>rise to a value of 1, x must be
  equal to 1 over little z.</span> </p><p><span m='302750'>Therefore, this side
  of the triangle is 1/z.</span> </p><p><span m='309730'>And therefore, the area
  of the triangle is 1/2 times 1/z,</span> <span m='316790'>which is this
  expression here.</span> </p><p><span m='319390'>And so we have found the value
  of the CDF for all possible</span> <span m='323430'>choices of little
  z.</span> </p><p><span m='326390'>We can draw the CDF.</span> </p><p><span
  m='337860'>And the picture is as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='340770'>For z
  negative, the CDF is equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='344980'>For z between
  0 and 1, the CDF rises linearly</span> <span m='351170'>at a slope of
  1/2.</span> </p><p><span m='353010'>And so when z is equal to 1, the CDF has
  risen</span> <span m='356810'>to a value of 1/2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='359300'>And then as z goes to infinity, this term disappears</span> <span
  m='363590'>and the CDF will converge to 1.</span> </p><p><span m='369110'>So
  it converges to 1 monotonically but in a</span> <span m='371940'>non-linear
  fashion.</span> </p><p><span m='373180'>So we get a picture of this
  type.</span> </p><p><span m='377580'>The next step, the final step, is to
  differentiate the CDF</span> <span m='383810'>and obtain the PDF.</span>
  </p><p><span m='393792'>In this region, the CDF is constant, so its derivative
  is</span> <span m='397990'>going to be equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='399850'>In this region, the CDF is linear, so its derivative is</span>
  <span m='404420'>equal to this factor of 1/2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='407140'>So the CDF is equal to 1/2 for z's between 0 and 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='415420'>And finally, in this region, this is the</span> <span
  m='417909'>formula for the CDF.</span> </p><p><span m='419210'>When we take
  the derivative, we get the expression 1 over</span> <span m='424100'>2z
  squared, which is a function that decreases as z</span> <span m='430630'>goes
  to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m='431810'>So it has a shape like this
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='434250'>So we have completed the solution to this
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='436600'>We found the CDF, and we found the
  corresponding PDF.</span> </p><p><span m='440410'>This methodology works more
  generally for more complicated</span> <span m='444640'>functions of X and Y
  and for more complicated distributions</span> <span m='448360'>for X and Y. Of
  course, when the functions or the</span> <span m='451250'>distributions are
  more complicated, the calculus</span> <span m='453680'>involved and the
  geometry may require a lot more work.</span> </p><p><span m='457600'>But
  conceptually, the methodology</span> <span m='459510'>is exactly the
  same.</span> </p><p></p>
