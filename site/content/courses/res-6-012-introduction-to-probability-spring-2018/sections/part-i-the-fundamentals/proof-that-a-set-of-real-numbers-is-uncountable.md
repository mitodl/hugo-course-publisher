title: Proof that a Set of Real Numbers is Uncountable
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="500">For those of you who are curious, we will go through
  an</span> <span m="3800">argument that establishes that the set of real
  numbers is an</span> <span m="7420">uncountable set.</span></p><p><span
  m="8830">It's a famous argument known as Cantor's</span> <span
  m="11060">diagonalization argument.</span></p><p><span m="13570">Actually,
  instead of looking at the set of all real</span> <span m="16480">numbers, we
  will first look at the set of all numbers, x,</span> <span m="22190">that
  belong to the open unit interval--</span> <span m="26110">so numbers between 0
  and 1--</span> <span m="28880">and such that their decimal expansion
  involves</span> <span m="34230">only threes and fours.</span></p><p><span
  m="40980">Now, the choice of three and four is somewhat
  arbitrary.</span></p><p><span m="45305">It doesn't matter.</span></p><p><span
  m="46840">What really matters is that we do not have</span> <span
  m="49700">long strings of nines.</span></p><p><span m="52280">So suppose that
  this set was countable.</span></p><p><span m="57300">If the set was countable,
  then that set could be written as</span> <span m="64440">equal to a set of
  this form, x1, x2, x3 and so on, where</span> <span m="71720">each one of
  these is a real number inside that set.</span></p><p><span m="78280">Now,
  suppose that this is the case.</span></p><p><span m="80860">Let us take those
  numbers and write them</span> <span m="83690">down in decimal
  notation.</span></p><p><span m="86620">For example, one number could be this
  one, and</span> <span m="91760">it continues forever.</span></p><p><span
  m="92920">Since we're talking about real numbers, their decimal</span> <span
  m="95330">expansion will go on forever.</span></p><p><span m="98210">Suppose
  that the second number is of this kind, and it has</span> <span m="103979">its
  own decimal expansion.</span></p><p><span m="108150">Suppose that the third
  number is, again, with some decimal</span> <span m="113430">expansion and so
  on.</span></p><p><span m="115690">So we have assumed that our set is countable
  and</span> <span m="120790">therefore, the set is equal to that
  sequence.</span></p><p><span m="123930">So this sequence exhausts all the
  numbers in that set.</span></p><p><span m="129470">Can it do
  that?</span></p><p><span m="132270">Let's construct a new number in the
  following fashion.</span></p><p><span m="136220">The new number looks at this
  digit and</span> <span m="139579">does something different.</span></p><p><span
  m="140840">Looks at this digit, the second digit of the second</span> <span
  m="144010">number, and does something different.</span></p><p><span
  m="146420">Looks at the third digit of the third number and does</span> <span
  m="149840">something different.</span></p><p><span m="150980">And we continue
  this way.</span></p><p><span m="153200">This number that we have constructed
  here is different</span> <span m="156829">from the first
  number.</span></p><p><span m="158120">They differ in the first
  digit.</span></p><p><span m="159820">It's different from the second
  number.</span></p><p><span m="161520">They differ in the second
  digit.</span></p><p><span m="163470">It's different from the third number
  because it's different</span> <span m="166370">in the third digit and so
  on.</span></p><p><span m="168780">So this is a number, and this number is
  different</span> <span m="175900">from xi for all i.</span></p><p><span
  m="181310">So we have an element of this set which does not belong to</span>
  <span m="187510">this sequence.</span></p><p><span m="188800">Therefore, it
  cannot be true that this set is equal to the</span> <span m="193970">set
  formed by that sequence.</span></p><p><span m="196980">And so this is a
  contradiction to the initial assumption that</span> <span m="201610">this set
  could be written in this form, and this</span> <span m="205100">contradiction
  establishes that since this is not possible,</span> <span m="209560">that the
  set that we have here is an uncountable set.</span></p><p><span
  m="214520">Now, this set is a subset of the set of real
  numbers.</span></p><p><span m="218560">Since this one is uncountable, it is
  not hard to show that</span> <span m="222030">the set of real numbers, which
  is a bigger set, will also be</span> <span
  m="226060">uncountable.</span></p><p><span m="227940">And so this is this
  particular famous argument.</span></p><p><span m="231440">We will not need it
  or make any arguments of this type in</span> <span m="234570">this class, but
  it's so beautiful that it's worth for</span> <span m="238340">everyone to see
  it once in their lifetime.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
