title: More Properties of Probabilities
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="2110">We will now continue and derive some additional</span> <span
  m="4830">properties of probability laws which are, again, consequences</span>
  <span m="8560">of the axioms that we have introduced.</span></p><p><span
  m="11680">The first property is the following.</span></p><p><span m="14140">If
  we have two sets and one set is</span> <span m="17490">smaller than the
  other--</span> <span m="20170">so we have a picture as
  follows.</span></p><p><span m="22270">We have our sample
  space.</span></p><p><span m="24120">And we have a certain set,
  A.</span></p><p><span m="27080">And then we have a certain set, B, which is
  even bigger.</span></p><p><span m="32780">So the set B is the bigger blue
  set.</span></p><p><span m="38230">So if B is a set which is larger than A,
  then,</span> <span m="44890">naturally, the probability that the outcome falls
  inside</span> <span m="48200">B should be at least as big as the probability
  that the</span> <span m="51290">outcome falls inside A.</span></p><p><span
  m="53380">How do we prove this formally?</span></p><p><span m="56120">The set
  B can be expressed as a union of two pieces.</span></p><p><span m="62410">One
  piece is the set A itself.</span></p><p><span m="66290">The second piece is
  whatever elements of B there are, that</span> <span m="73300">do not belong in
  A. What are these elements?</span></p><p><span m="78030">They are elements
  that belong to B. And they do not belong</span> <span m="83789">to A, which
  means that they belong to the complement of A.</span></p><p><span m="87720">So
  we have expressed the set B as the union of two pieces.</span></p><p><span
  m="92050">Now this piece is A. This piece here is outside A. So</span> <span
  m="96930">these two pieces are disjoint.</span></p><p><span m="98979">And so
  we can apply the additivity axiom, and write</span> <span m="102190">that the
  probability of B is equal to the probability of A</span> <span m="107470">plus
  the probability of the other set.</span></p><p><span m="113570">And since
  probabilities are non-negative, this expression</span> <span m="117960">here
  is at least as large as the probability of A. And this</span> <span
  m="122860">concludes the proof of the property that</span> <span m="124710">we
  wanted to show.</span></p><p><span m="125640">Indeed, the probability of A is
  less than or equal to the</span> <span m="128978">probability of
  B.</span></p><p><span m="132770">The next property we will show is the
  following.</span></p><p><span m="136200">It allows us to write the probability
  of the union of</span> <span m="139960">two sets for the case now, where the
  two sets are not</span> <span m="144040">necessarily
  disjoint.</span></p><p><span m="146520">So the picture is as
  follows.</span></p><p><span m="151460">We have our two sets, A and B. These
  sets are</span> <span m="160440">not necessarily disjoint.</span></p><p><span
  m="163370">And we want to say something about the probability of the</span>
  <span m="165950">union of A and B.</span></p><p><span m="170880">Now the union
  of A and B consists of three pieces.</span></p><p><span m="174770">One piece
  is this one here.</span></p><p><span m="179440">And that piece consists of
  those elements of A that do</span> <span m="186100">not belong to B. So they
  belong to B complement.</span></p><p><span m="192080">This set has a certain
  probability, let's call it</span> <span m="195340">little a and indicate it on
  this diagram.</span></p><p><span m="199840">So a is the probability of this
  piece.</span></p><p><span m="203410">Another piece is this one here, which is
  the</span> <span m="206300">intersection of A and B. It has a certain
  probability that</span> <span m="210329">we denote by little
  b.</span></p><p><span m="212370">This is the probability of A intersection
  B.</span></p><p><span m="216510">And finally, there's another piece, which is
  out here.</span></p><p><span m="220730">And that piece has a certain
  probability c.</span></p><p><span m="223950">It is the probability of that
  set.</span></p><p><span m="226280">And what is that set?</span></p><p><span
  m="228010">That set is the following.</span></p><p><span m="230030">It's that
  part of B that consists of elements that do</span> <span m="233850">not belong
  in A. So it's B intersection with the</span> <span m="238520">complement of
  A.</span></p><p><span m="242470">Now let's express the two sides of this
  equality here in</span> <span m="246250">terms of little a, little b, and
  little c, and see whether</span> <span m="249280">we get the same
  thing.</span></p><p><span m="251190">So the probability of A union B. A union
  B consists of these</span> <span m="257800">three pieces that have
  probabilities little a, little</span> <span m="262000">b, and little c,
  respectively.</span></p><p><span m="264810">And by the additivity axiom, the
  probability of the union</span> <span m="267710">of A and B is the sum of the
  probabilities</span> <span m="270000">of these three
  pieces.</span></p><p><span m="272200">Let's look now at the right hand side of
  that equation and</span> <span m="276480">see whether we get the same
  thing.</span></p><p><span m="278800">The probability of A plus the probability
  of B, minus the</span> <span m="283070">probability of A intersection B is
  equal to the following.</span></p><p><span m="289150">A consists of two pieces
  that have probabilities little a</span> <span m="292480">and little
  b.</span></p><p><span m="295540">The set B consists of two pieces that have
  probabilities</span> <span m="298240">little b and little
  c.</span></p><p><span m="302630">And then we subtract the probability of
  the</span> <span m="304800">intersection, which is b.</span></p><p><span
  m="307960">And we notice that we can cancel here one b</span> <span
  m="313740">with another b.</span></p><p><span m="315210">And what we are left
  with is a plus b plus c.</span></p><p><span m="323290">So this
  checks.</span></p><p><span m="325210">And indeed we have this equality
  here.</span></p><p><span m="330470">We have verified that it is
  true.</span></p><p><span m="333330">One particular consequence of the equality
  that we derived</span> <span m="337720">is the following.</span></p><p><span
  m="339140">Since this term here is always non-negative, this means that</span>
  <span m="348409">the probability of A union B is always less than or
  equal</span> <span m="353390">to the probability of A plus the probability of
  B. This</span> <span m="357430">inequality here is quite useful whenever we
  want to</span> <span m="360760">argue that a certain probability is</span>
  <span m="362610">smaller than something.</span></p><p><span m="363850">And it
  has a name.</span></p><p><span m="365460">It's called the union
  bound.</span></p><p><span m="373020">We finally consider one last consequence
  of our axioms.</span></p><p><span m="377650">And namely, we are going to
  derive an expression, a way of</span> <span m="381530">calculating the
  probability of the union of three sets, not</span> <span
  m="386470">necessarily disjoint.</span></p><p><span m="388830">So we have our
  sample space.</span></p><p><span m="391890">And within the sample space there
  are three sets-- set A,</span> <span m="397652">set B, and set
  C.</span></p><p><span m="406630">We are going to use a set theoretic
  relation.</span></p><p><span m="410170">We are going to express the union of
  these three sets as</span> <span m="415840">the union of three disjoint
  pieces.</span></p><p><span m="420370">What are these disjoint
  pieces?</span></p><p><span m="423900">One piece is the set A
  itself.</span></p><p><span m="433050">The second piece is going to be that
  part of B which is</span> <span m="439500">outside A. So this is the
  intersection of B with the</span> <span m="446740">complement of
  A.</span></p><p><span m="450860">The third piece is going to be whatever is
  left in order to</span> <span m="458590">form the union of the three
  sets.</span></p><p><span m="460400">What is left is that part of C that does
  not belong to A and</span> <span m="465980">that does not belong to B. So that
  part is C intersection</span> <span m="473020">with A complement and B
  complement.</span></p><p><span m="478170">Now this set here, of course, is the
  same as that set</span> <span m="482380">because intersection of two sets is
  the same no matter in</span> <span m="485230">which order we take the two
  sets.</span></p><p><span m="487430">And similarly, the set that we have here
  is the same one that</span> <span m="491410">appears in that
  expression.</span></p><p><span m="493900">Now we notice that these three
  pieces, the red, the blue, and</span> <span m="496840">the green, are disjoint
  from each other.</span></p><p><span m="499560">So by the additivity axiom, the
  probability of this union</span> <span m="505820">here is going to be the sum
  of the probabilities</span> <span m="511080">of the three
  pieces.</span></p><p><span m="513200">And that's exactly the expression</span>
  <span m="515470">the we have up here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
