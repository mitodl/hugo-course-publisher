title: The PDF of a General Function
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='700'>In this important segment, we will develop a method
  for</span> <span m='4110'>finding the PDF of a general function of a
  continuous</span> <span m='8119'>random variable, a function g of X, which, in
  general, could</span> <span m='11970'>be nonlinear.</span> </p><p><span
  m='13970'>The method is very general and involves two steps.</span>
  </p><p><span m='17780'>The first step is to find the CDF of Y. And then the
  second</span> <span m='22310'>step is to take the derivative of the CDF
  and</span> <span m='25290'>then find the PDF.</span> </p><p><span
  m='27210'>Most of the work lies here in finding the CDF of Y. And how</span>
  <span m='31130'>do we do that?</span> </p><p><span m='32530'>Well, since Y is
  a function of the random variable X, we</span> <span m='36630'>replace Y by g
  of X. And now we're dealing with a</span> <span m='41130'>probability problem
  that involves a random variable, X,</span> <span m='45080'>with a known
  PDF.</span> </p><p><span m='46810'>And we somehow calculate this
  probability.</span> </p><p><span m='50010'>So let us illustrate this
  procedure</span> <span m='52800'>through some examples.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56350'>In our first example, we let X be a random variable which is</span>
  <span m='61830'>uniform on the range from 0 to 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='68930'>And so the height of the PDF is 1/2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='74090'>And we wish to find the PDF of the random variable Y which is</span>
  <span m='78860'>defined as X cubed.</span> </p><p><span m='81720'>So since X
  goes all the way up to 2, Y goes all</span> <span m='85600'>the way up to
  8.</span> </p><p><span m='91780'>The first step is to find the CDF of Y. And
  since Y is a</span> <span m='104430'>specific function of X, we replace that
  functional form.</span> </p><p><span m='110580'>And we write it this
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='114759'>So we want to calculate the probability
  that x cubed is</span> <span m='117630'>less than or equal to a certain number
  y.</span> </p><p><span m='121550'>Let us take cubic roots of both sides of
  this inequality.</span> </p><p><span m='126500'>This is the same as the
  probability that X is less</span> <span m='130478'>than or equal to y to the
  1/3.</span> </p><p><span m='136480'>Now, we only care about values of y that
  are between 0 and 8.</span> </p><p><span m='142280'>So this calculation is
  going to be for those values of y.</span> </p><p><span m='146780'>For other
  values of y, we know that the PDF is equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='151710'>And there's no work that needs to be done there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155576'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='157430'>Now, y is less than
  or equal to 8, so the cubic root of y</span> <span m='163030'>is less than or
  equal to 2.</span> </p><p><span m='165070'>So y to the 1/3 is going to be a
  number</span> <span m='169550'>somewhere in this range.</span> </p><p><span
  m='171280'>Let's say this number.</span> </p><p><span m='174900'>We want the
  probability that X is less than or</span> <span m='177180'>equal to that
  value.</span> </p><p><span m='178640'>So that probability is equal to this
  area under the PDF of</span> <span m='184480'>X. And since it is uniform, this
  area is easy to find.</span> </p><p><span m='189330'>It's the height, which is
  1/2 times the base,</span> <span m='194080'>which is y to the 1/3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='196820'>So we continue this calculation, and we get 1/2</span>
  <span m='200750'>times y to the 1/3.</span> </p><p><span m='203620'>So this is
  the formula for the CDF of Y for values of little</span> <span m='208450'>y
  between 0 and 8.</span> </p><p><span m='211200'>This completes step
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='212730'>The second step is simple calculus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='216490'>We just need to take the derivative of the CDF.</span>
  </p><p><span m='224079'>And the derivative is 1/2 times 1/3, this exponent, y
  to</span> <span m='233340'>the power of minus 2/3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='238250'>Or in a cleaner form, 1/6 times 1 over y</span> <span m='245400'>to
  the power 2/3.</span> </p><p><span m='249740'>So the form of this PDF is not a
  constant anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='257209'>Y is not a uniform random
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='260070'>The PDF becomes larger and larger as
  y approaches 0.</span> </p><p><span m='264390'>And in fact, in this example,
  it even blows up when y</span> <span m='269280'>becomes closer and closer to
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='273159'>So this is the shape of the PDF of Y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='278050'>Our second example is as follows.</span> </p><p><span
  m='282150'>You go to the gym, you jump on the treadmill, and you set
  the</span> <span m='286840'>speed on the treadmill to some random value which
  we call X.</span> </p><p><span m='293210'>And that random value is somewhere
  between 5 and 10</span> <span m='298400'>kilometers per hour.</span>
  </p><p><span m='300000'>And the way that you set it is chosen at random and
  uniformly</span> <span m='303780'>over this interval.</span> </p><p><span
  m='306200'>So X is uniformly distributed on the interval</span> <span
  m='309520'>between 5 and 10.</span> </p><p><span m='312630'>You want to run a
  total of 10 kilometers.</span> </p><p><span m='315930'>How long is it going to
  take you?</span> </p><p><span m='318470'>Let the time it takes you be denoted
  by Y. And the time</span> <span m='324180'>it's going to take you is the
  distance you want to travel,</span> <span m='327120'>which is 10 divided by
  the speed with</span> <span m='330720'>which you will be going.</span>
  </p><p><span m='332240'>So the random variable y is defined in terms of x
  through</span> <span m='336070'>this particular expression.</span>
  </p><p><span m='338920'>We want to find the PDF of y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='342270'>First let us look at the range of the random variable Y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='349320'>Since x takes values between 5 and 10, Y takes
  values</span> <span m='354590'>between 1 and 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='362240'>Therefore, the PDF of Y is going to be 0</span> <span
  m='366140'>outside that range.</span> </p><p><span m='367990'>And let us now
  focus on values of Y that belong to this</span> <span m='372990'>interesting
  range.</span> </p><p><span m='374950'>So 1 less than y less than or equal to
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='378980'>And now we start with our two-step
  program.</span> </p><p><span m='381740'>We want to find the CDF of Y, namely,
  the probability that</span> <span m='387060'>capital Y takes a value less than
  or equal to a certain</span> <span m='391350'>little y in this range.</span>
  </p><p><span m='393950'>We recall the definition of capital Y. So now
  we're</span> <span m='399540'>dealing with a probability problem that involves
  the</span> <span m='402970'>random variable capital X, whose</span> <span
  m='405320'>distribution is given to us.</span> </p><p><span m='408470'>Now, we
  rewrite this event as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='413130'>We move X to the
  other side.</span> </p><p><span m='415409'>This is the probability that X is
  larger than or equal after</span> <span m='419730'>we move the little y also
  to the left-hand side.</span> </p><p><span m='423380'>X being larger than or
  equal to 10 over little y.</span> </p><p><span m='428540'>Now, y is between 1
  and 2.</span> </p><p><span m='432340'>10/y is going to be a number between 5
  and 10.</span> </p><p><span m='437160'>So 10/y is going to be somewhere in
  this range.</span> </p><p><span m='444210'>We're interested in the probability
  that X is larger</span> <span m='447230'>than or equal to that number.</span>
  </p><p><span m='449570'>And this probability is going to be the area of
  this</span> <span m='453760'>rectangle here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='456670'>And the area of that rectangle is equal to the height of the</span>
  <span m='462070'>rectangle--</span> <span m='463240'>now, the height of this
  rectangle is going to be 1/5.</span> </p><p><span m='466970'>This is the
  choice that makes the total area under this</span> <span m='469890'>curve be
  equal to 1--</span> <span m='474120'>times the base.</span> </p><p><span
  m='475600'>And the length of the base is this number</span> <span
  m='478240'>10 minus that number.</span> </p><p><span m='480770'>It's 10 minus
  10/y.</span> </p><p><span m='486640'>So this is the form of the CDF of Y for
  y's in this range.</span> </p><p><span m='493030'>To find the PDF of Y, we
  just take the derivative.</span> </p><p><span m='498420'>And we get 1/5 times
  the derivative of this term, which</span> <span m='504710'>is minus 10,
  divided by y squared.</span> </p><p><span m='514500'>But when we take the
  derivative of 1/y, that gives</span> <span m='517530'>us another minus
  sign.</span> </p><p><span m='519740'>The two minus signs cancel, and we</span>
  <span m='522110'>obtain 2 over y squared.</span> </p><p><span m='526410'>And
  if you wish to plot this, it starts at 2.</span> </p><p><span m='531790'>And
  then as y increases, the PDF actually decreases.</span> </p><p><span
  m='539500'>And this is the form of the PDF of the random variable y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='543990'>This is the form which is true when y lies between 1
  and 2.</span> </p><p><span m='549010'>And of course, the PDF is going to be 0
  for other</span> <span m='553340'>choices of little y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='558990'>So what we have seen here is a pretty systematic approach</span>
  <span m='563410'>towards finding the PDF of the random variable Y. Again,
  the</span> <span m='567820'>first step is to look at the CDF, write the CDF in
  terms of</span> <span m='572450'>the random variable X, whose distribution is
  known, and</span> <span m='576050'>then solve a probability problem that
  involves this</span> <span m='578950'>particular random variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='581230'>And then in the last step, we just need to
  differentiate the</span> <span m='584230'>CDF in order to obtain the
  PDF.</span> </p><p></p>
