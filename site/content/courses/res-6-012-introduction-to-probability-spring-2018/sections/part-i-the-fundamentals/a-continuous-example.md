  <p><span m="170">We will now go through a probability calculation for</span>
  <span m="3400">the case where we have a continuous sample
  space.</span></p><p><span m="6750">We revisit our earlier example in which we
  were throwing a</span> <span m="10820">dart into a square target, the square
  target</span> <span m="14840">being the unit square.</span></p><p><span
  m="16010">And we were guaranteed that our dart would fall somewhere</span>
  <span m="18970">inside this set.</span></p><p><span m="20780">So our sample
  space is the unit square itself.</span></p><p><span m="24090">We have a
  description of the sample space, but we do not</span> <span m="27670">yet have
  a probability law.</span></p><p><span m="29140">We need to specify
  one.</span></p><p><span m="31340">The choice of a probability law could be
  arbitrary.</span></p><p><span m="35700">It's up to us to choose how to model a
  certain situation.</span></p><p><span m="39620">And to keep things simple,
  we're going to assume that our</span> <span m="42780">probability law is a
  uniform one, which means that the</span> <span m="48030">probability of any
  particular subset of the sample space is</span> <span m="51350">going to be
  the area of that subset.</span></p><p><span m="54040">So if we have some
  subset lying somewhere here and we</span> <span m="57770">ask what is the
  probability that we fall into that subset?</span></p><p><span m="61190">The
  probability is exactly the area of</span> <span m="64470">that particular
  subset.</span></p><p><span m="67010">Once more, this is an arbitrary choice of
  a</span> <span m="69860">probability law.</span></p><p><span m="71000">There's
  nothing in our assumptions so far that would</span> <span m="74140">force us
  to make this particular choice.</span></p><p><span m="76370">And we just use
  it for the purposes of this example.</span></p><p><span m="80300">So now let
  us calculate some probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="84370">Let us look at
  this event.</span></p><p><span m="86750">This is the event that the sum of the
  two numbers that we get</span> <span m="92539">in our experiment is less than
  or equal to 1/2.</span></p><p><span m="96440">It is always useful to work in
  terms of a picture and to</span> <span m="100090">depict that event in a
  picture of the sample space.</span></p><p><span m="104259">So in terms of that
  sample space, the points that make</span> <span m="108640">this event to be
  true are just a triangle that lies below the</span> <span m="115900">line,
  where this is the line, that's x plus y equals 1/2.</span></p><p><span
  m="122940">Anything below that line, these are the outcomes that</span> <span
  m="126860">make this event happen.</span></p><p><span m="128978">So we're
  trying to find the probability of this red event.</span></p><p><span
  m="132360">We have assumed that probability is equal to
  area.</span></p><p><span m="136040">Therefore, the probability we're trying to
  calculate is</span> <span m="139310">the area of a
  triangle.</span></p><p><span m="141180">And the area of a triangle is 1/2
  times the base of the</span> <span m="145880">triangle, which is 1/2 in our
  case, times the height of the</span> <span m="150220">triangle, which is again
  1/2 in our case.</span></p><p><span m="153650">And the end result is
  1/8.</span></p><p><span m="158850">Let us now calculate another
  probability.</span></p><p><span m="163390">Now, this is an event that consists
  of</span> <span m="166730">only a single element.</span></p><p><span
  m="169240">We take the point 0.5, 0.3, which sits somewhere
  here.</span></p><p><span m="175760">The event of interest is a set, but that
  set consists of</span> <span m="180220">a single point.</span></p><p><span
  m="181380">So we're asking for the probability that our dart</span> <span
  m="184260">falls exactly on top of that point.</span></p><p><span
  m="188470">What is it?</span></p><p><span m="189210">Well, it is the area of a
  set that</span> <span m="192260">consists of a single
  point.</span></p><p><span m="193750">What is the area of a single
  point?</span></p><p><span m="196050">It is 0.</span></p><p><span
  m="197910">And similarly for any other single point inside that</span> <span
  m="200990">sample space that we might have considered, the answer is</span>
  <span m="204090">going to be 0.</span></p><p><span m="207500">Let us now
  abstract from this example, as well as the</span> <span m="211430">previous
  one, and note the following.</span></p><p><span m="214850">Probability
  calculations involve a</span> <span m="217210">sequence of four
  steps.</span></p><p><span m="220050">Starting with a word description of a
  problem, of a</span> <span m="224000">probabilistic experiment, we first
  write</span> <span m="226670">down the sample space.</span></p><p><span
  m="229200">Then we specify a probability law.</span></p><p><span
  m="232490">Let me emphasize again here that this step has some</span> <span
  m="235270">arbitrariness in it.</span></p><p><span m="237030">You can choose
  any probability law you like, although for</span> <span m="239840">your
  results to be useful it would be good if your</span> <span
  m="242480">probability law captures the real-world phenomenon you're</span>
  <span m="245350">trying to model.</span></p><p><span m="247090">Typically
  you're interested in calculating the probability of</span> <span
  m="251010">some event.</span></p><p><span m="253170">That event may be
  described in some loose manner, so you need</span> <span m="256519">to
  describe it mathematically.</span></p><p><span m="258720">And if possible,
  it's always good to describe it in terms</span> <span m="262570">of a
  picture.</span></p><p><span m="263690">Pictures are immensely useful when
  going</span> <span m="266300">through this process.</span></p><p><span
  m="268350">And finally, the last step is to go ahead and calculate the</span>
  <span m="272970">probability of the event of interest.</span></p><p><span
  m="275890">Now, a probability law in principle specifies the</span> <span
  m="278690">probability of every event, and there's</span> <span
  m="280930">nothing else to do.</span></p><p><span m="282860">But quite often
  the probability law will be given</span> <span m="285670">in some implicit
  manner, for example, by specifying the</span> <span m="289540">probabilities
  of only some of the events.</span></p><p><span m="292390">In that case, you
  may have to do some additional work to</span> <span m="295310">find the
  probability of the particular event</span> <span m="298010">that you care
  about.</span></p><p><span m="299870">This last step sometimes will be
  easy.</span></p><p><span m="303840">Sometimes it may be
  complicated.</span></p><p><span m="306340">But in either case, by following
  this four-step</span> <span m="310820">procedure and by being systematic you
  will always be</span> <span m="314790">able to come up with a single correct
  answer.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
