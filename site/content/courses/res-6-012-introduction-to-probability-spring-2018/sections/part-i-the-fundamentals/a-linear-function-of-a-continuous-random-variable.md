title: A Linear Function of a Continuous Random Variable
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='1110'>We now move to the case of continuous random
  variables.</span> </p><p><span m='4280'>We will start with a special case
  where we want to find the</span> <span m='7660'>PDF of a linear function of a
  continuous random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='12810'>We will start by
  considering a simple example, and study it</span> <span m='17780'>using an
  intuitive argument.</span> </p><p><span m='20410'>And afterwards, we will
  justify our conclusions</span> <span m='23580'>mathematically.</span>
  </p><p><span m='24870'>So we start with a random variable X that has a PDF
  over</span> <span m='28190'>the form shown in this figure so that it is a
  piecewise</span> <span m='31560'>constant PDF.</span> </p><p><span
  m='33510'>We then consider a random variable z, which is defined</span> <span
  m='36650'>to be 2 times X. The random variable x takes values</span> <span
  m='42180'>between minus 1 and 1.</span> </p><p><span m='44250'>So z takes
  values between minus 2 and 2.</span> </p><p><span m='51560'>Now, values of X
  between minus 1 and 0 correspond to values</span> <span m='56500'>of Z between
  minus 2 and 0.</span> </p><p><span m='59810'>The different values of X in this
  range are, in some sense,</span> <span m='63780'>equally likely, because we
  have a constant PDF.</span> </p><p><span m='66750'>And that argues that the
  corresponding values of Z</span> <span m='69300'>should also be, in some
  sense, equally likely.</span> </p><p><span m='72200'>So the PDF should be
  constant over this range.</span> </p><p><span m='76180'>By a similar argument,
  the PDF of Z should also be constant</span> <span m='80930'>over the range
  from 0 to 2.</span> </p><p><span m='83480'>And the PDF must, of course, be 0
  outside this range,</span> <span m='88200'>because these are values of Z that
  are impossible.</span> </p><p><span m='91780'>Let us now try to figure out the
  parameters of this PDF.</span> </p><p><span m='95759'>The probability that X
  is positive is the</span> <span m='100729'>area of this rectangle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='102979'>And the area of this rectangle is 2/3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='106000'>So the area of this rectangle should also be
  2/3.</span> </p><p><span m='110710'>And that means that the height of this
  rectangle should be</span> <span m='114810'>equal to 1/3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='116830'>Similarly, the probability that X is negative is the area</span>
  <span m='120770'>of this rectangle, and the area of this rectangle is</span>
  <span m='124070'>equal to 1/3.</span> </p><p><span m='125920'>When X is
  negative, Z is also negative, so the probability</span> <span m='129130'>of a
  negative value should be equal to 1/3.</span> </p><p><span m='131960'>And for
  the area of this rectangle to be 1/3, it means</span> <span m='135650'>that
  the height of this rectangle should be 1/6.</span> </p><p><span m='140240'>So
  what happened here?</span> </p><p><span m='141530'>We started with a PDF of X
  and essentially stretched it out</span> <span m='146420'>by a factor of 2
  while keeping the same shape.</span> </p><p><span m='151100'>However, we also
  scaled it down by a</span> <span m='155300'>corresponding amount.</span>
  </p><p><span m='156880'>So 2/3 became 1/3, and 1/3 became 1/6.</span>
  </p><p><span m='161660'>The reason for this scaling down is because we need
  the</span> <span m='165590'>total probability, the total area under this PDF,
  to be</span> <span m='169870'>equal to 1.</span> </p><p><span m='172270'>If we
  now add a number, let's say 3, to the random variable</span> <span
  m='177540'>Z, what is going to happen?</span> </p><p><span m='180340'>The
  random variable Y now will take values from</span> <span m='183740'>minus 2
  plus 3--</span> <span m='185290'>this is plus 1--</span> <span m='187010'>all
  the way up to 2 plus 3, which is plus 5.</span> </p><p><span m='194170'>Values
  in the range from 1 to 3 correspond to values of Z in</span> <span
  m='200700'>the range from minus 2 to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='202590'>These
  values are all, in some sense, equally likely.</span> </p><p><span
  m='206360'>So they should also be equally likely here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='209290'>And by a similar argument, these values in the range from</span>
  <span m='213380'>3 to 5 should also be equally likely.</span> </p><p><span
  m='216600'>This rectangle corresponds to this rectangle here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='222280'>So the area should be the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='224030'>And therefore, the height should also be the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m='227320'>Therefore, the height here should be 1/6.</span>
  </p><p><span m='230090'>And by the same argument, the height here</span> <span
  m='232150'>should be equal to 1/3.</span> </p><p><span m='236130'>So what
  happens here is that when we add 3 to a random</span> <span
  m='240640'>variable, the PDF just gets shifted by 3 but otherwise</span> <span
  m='246590'>retains the same shape.</span> </p><p><span m='249510'>So the story
  is entirely similar to what happened in</span> <span m='252220'>the discrete
  case.</span> </p><p><span m='253520'>We start with a PDF of X. We stretch it
  horizontally by a</span> <span m='258660'>factor of 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='260360'>And then we shift it horizontally by 3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='264280'>The only difference is that here in the continuous case,</span>
  <span m='267640'>we also need to scale the plot in the vertical dimension by
  a</span> <span m='273820'>factor of 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='275330'>Actually, make it smaller by a factor of 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='278909'>And this needs to be done in order to keep the total area</span>
  <span m='282300'>under the PDF equal to 1.</span> </p><p><span m='286302'>Let
  us now go through a mathematical argument with the</span> <span
  m='289390'>purpose of also finding a formula that represents what</span> <span
  m='292700'>we just did in our previous example.</span> </p><p><span
  m='295730'>Let Y be equal to aX plus b.</span> </p><p><span m='298980'>Here, X
  is a random variable with a given PDF.</span> </p><p><span m='303350'>a and b
  are given constants.</span> </p><p><span m='306140'>Now, if a is equal to 0,
  then Y is identically equal to b.</span> </p><p><span m='311990'>So it is a
  constant random variable and</span> <span m='314020'>does not have a
  PDF.</span> </p><p><span m='315560'>So let us exclude this case and start by
  assuming that a</span> <span m='320080'>is a positive number.</span>
  </p><p><span m='323400'>We can try to work, as in the discrete case, and
  try</span> <span m='327490'>something like the following.</span> </p><p><span
  m='329440'>The probability that Y takes on a specific value is the</span>
  <span m='334120'>same as the probability that aX plus b takes on a
  specific</span> <span m='339430'>value, which is the same as the probability
  that X takes</span> <span m='344030'>on the specific value, y minus b divided
  by a.</span> </p><p><span m='348390'>This equality was useful in the discrete
  case.</span> </p><p><span m='350909'>Is it useful here?</span> </p><p><span
  m='352610'>Unfortunately not.</span> </p><p><span m='353850'>When we're
  dealing with continuous random variables,</span> <span m='356180'>the
  probability that the continuous random variable is</span> <span
  m='358710'>exactly equal to a given number, this probability is</span> <span
  m='362210'>going to be equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='363440'>And the same
  applies to this side as well.</span> </p><p><span m='365750'>So we have that 0
  is equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='368190'>And this is uninformative, and
  we have not made any progress.</span> </p><p><span m='372030'>So instead of
  working with probabilities of individual</span> <span m='375020'>points which
  will always be 0, we will work with</span> <span m='379110'>probabilities of
  intervals that generally have non-zero</span> <span
  m='383140'>probability.</span> </p><p><span m='384340'>The trick is to work
  with CDFs.</span> </p><p><span m='386930'>So let us try to find the CDF of Y.
  The CDF of the random</span> <span m='393690'>variable Y is defined as the
  probability that the random</span> <span m='397950'>variable is less than or
  equal to a certain number.</span> </p><p><span m='402000'>Now, in our case, Y
  is aX plus b.</span> </p><p><span m='409210'>We move b to the other side of
  the inequality and then divide</span> <span m='413310'>both sides of the
  inequality by a.</span> </p><p><span m='416230'>And we get that this is the
  same as the probability that X</span> <span m='420700'>is less than or equal
  to y minus b divided by a, which is</span> <span m='427010'>the same as the
  CDF of X evaluated at y minus b over a.</span> </p><p><span m='434350'>So we
  have a formula for the CDF of Y in terms of the CDF</span> <span m='438500'>of
  X.</span> </p><p><span m='440280'>How can we find the PDF?</span> </p><p><span
  m='442060'>Simply by differentiating.</span> </p><p><span m='444080'>We
  differentiate both sides of this equation.</span> </p><p><span m='448130'>The
  derivative of a CDF is a PDF.</span> </p><p><span m='451220'>And therefore,
  the PDF of Y is going to be equal to the</span> <span m='456890'>derivative of
  this side.</span> </p><p><span m='458730'>Here we need to use the chain
  rule.</span> </p><p><span m='461080'>First, we take the derivative of this
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='465380'>And the derivative of the CDF is a
  PDF, so the PDF of X</span> <span m='470930'>evaluated at this particular
  number.</span> </p><p><span m='475960'>But then we also need to take the
  derivative of the argument</span> <span m='479680'>inside with respect to
  y.</span> </p><p><span m='482230'>And that derivative is equal to 1/a.</span>
  </p><p><span m='486480'>And this gives us a formula for the PDF of Y in terms
  of</span> <span m='491130'>the PDF of X.</span> </p><p><span m='493680'>How
  about the case where a is less than 0?</span> </p><p><span m='498950'>What is
  going to change?</span> </p><p><span m='500370'>The first step up to here
  remains valid.</span> </p><p><span m='504570'>But now when we divide both
  sides of the inequality by a,</span> <span m='509140'>the direction of the
  inequality gets reversed.</span> </p><p><span m='512520'>So we obtain instead
  the probability that X is larger</span> <span m='518510'>than or equal to y
  minus b divided by a.</span> </p><p><span m='523850'>And this is 1 minus the
  probability that X is less</span> <span m='530840'>than y minus b over
  a.</span> </p><p><span m='534040'>Now, X is a continuous random variable, so
  the probability</span> <span m='537070'>is not going to change if here we make
  the inequality to be a</span> <span m='540860'>less than or equal sign.</span>
  </p><p><span m='546320'>And what we have here is 1 minus the CDF of X
  evaluated</span> <span m='552760'>at y minus b over a.</span> </p><p><span
  m='556890'>We use the chain rule once more, and we obtain that the</span>
  <span m='562300'>PDF of Y, in this case, is equal to minus the PDF of X</span>
  <span m='572920'>evaluated at y minus b over a times 1/a.</span> </p><p><span
  m='581420'>Now, when a is positive, a is the same as the</span> <span
  m='585240'>absolute value of a.</span> </p><p><span m='587052'>When a is
  negative and we have this formula, we have here a</span> <span
  m='590450'>minus a, which is the same as the absolute value of a.</span>
  </p><p><span m='594690'>So we can unify these two formulas by replacing
  the</span> <span m='599560'>occurrences of a and that minus sign by just using
  the</span> <span m='603150'>absolute value.</span> </p><p><span m='604670'>And
  this gives us this formula for the PDF of Y in terms of</span> <span
  m='610360'>the PDF of X. And it is a formula that's valid whether a</span>
  <span m='614270'>is positive or negative.</span> </p><p><span m='618510'>What
  this formula represents is the following.</span> </p><p><span
  m='622420'>Because of the factor of a that we have here, we take the</span>
  <span m='627700'>PDF of X and scale it horizontally by a factor of a.</span>
  </p><p><span m='632482'>Because of the term b that we have here, the PDF also
  gets</span> <span m='637040'>shifted horizontally by b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='639560'>And finally, this term here corresponds to a vertical</span> <span
  m='643380'>scaling of the plot that we have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='645920'>And the reason that this term is present is so that the PDF</span>
  <span m='649980'>of Y integrates to 1.</span> </p><p><span m='653750'>It is
  interesting to also compare with the corresponding</span> <span
  m='656730'>discrete formula that we derived earlier.</span> </p><p><span
  m='659620'>The discrete formula has exactly the same appearance</span> <span
  m='663940'>except that the scaling factor is not present.</span> </p><p><span
  m='667630'>So for the case of continuous random variables, we need to</span>
  <span m='670340'>scale vertically the PDF.</span> </p><p><span m='672880'>But
  in the discrete case, such a scaling is not present.</span> </p><p></p>
