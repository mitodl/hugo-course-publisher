  <p><span m="1700">This will be a short tutorial on infinite series,
  their</span> <span m="5190">definition and their basic
  properties.</span></p><p><span m="8470">What is an infinite
  series?</span></p><p><span m="10000">We're given a sequence of numbers ai,
  indexed by i,</span> <span m="14450">where i ranges from 1 to
  infinity.</span></p><p><span m="17410">So it's an infinite
  sequence.</span></p><p><span m="18730">And we want to add the terms of that
  sequence together.</span></p><p><span m="22470">We denote the resulting sum of
  that infinity of terms using</span> <span m="27220">this
  notation.</span></p><p><span m="28640">But what does that mean
  exactly?</span></p><p><span m="31080">What is the formal definition of an
  infinite series?</span></p><p><span m="33990">Well, the infinite series is
  defined as the limit, as n</span> <span m="37630">goes to infinity, of the
  finite series in which we add</span> <span m="42040">only the first n terms in
  the series.</span></p><p><span m="46160">However, this definition makes sense
  only as long as the</span> <span m="50590">limit exists.</span></p><p><span
  m="57890">This brings up the question, when does this limit
  exist?</span></p><p><span m="63910">The nicest case arises when all the terms
  are</span> <span m="66810">non-negative.</span></p><p><span m="68130">If all
  the terms are non-negative,</span> <span m="69760">here's what's
  happening.</span></p><p><span m="71710">We consider the partial sum of the
  first n terms.</span></p><p><span m="74870">And then we increase
  n.</span></p><p><span m="76630">This means that we add more
  terms.</span></p><p><span m="78620">So the partial sum keeps becoming bigger
  and bigger.</span></p><p><span m="82600">The sequence of partial sums is a
  monotonic sequence.</span></p><p><span m="87320">Now monotonic sequences
  always converge either to a finite</span> <span m="92130">number or to
  infinity.</span></p><p><span m="94090">In either case, this limit will
  exist.</span></p><p><span m="97810">And therefore, the series is well
  defined.</span></p><p><span m="101039">The situation is more complicated if
  the terms ai</span> <span m="105610">can have different
  signs.</span></p><p><span m="107830">In that case, it's possible that the
  limit does not exist.</span></p><p><span m="111600">And so the series is not
  well defined.</span></p><p><span m="114610">The more interesting and</span>
  <span m="115979">complicated case is the following.</span></p><p><span
  m="118570">It's possible that this limit exists.</span></p><p><span
  m="120880">However, if we rearrange the terms in the sequence, we</span> <span
  m="124860">might get a different limit.</span></p><p><span m="129259">When can
  we avoid those complicated situations?</span></p><p><span m="133300">We can
  avoid them if it turns out that the sum of the</span> <span
  m="138490">absolute value of the numbers sums to a finite
  number.</span></p><p><span m="144620">Now this series that we have here is an
  infinite series in</span> <span m="148900">which we add non-negative
  numbers.</span></p><p><span m="151579">And by the fact that we mentioned
  earlier, this</span> <span m="155170">infinite series is always well
  defined.</span></p><p><span m="157520">And it's going to be either finite or
  infinite.</span></p><p><span m="160590">If it turns out to be finite, then the
  original series is</span> <span m="166670">guaranteed to be well defined, to
  have a finite limit when we</span> <span m="173790">define it that way, and
  furthermore, that finite limit</span> <span m="177630">is the same even if we
  rearrange the different terms,</span> <span m="182450">if we rearrange the
  sequence with which we sum the</span> <span m="186320">different
  terms.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
