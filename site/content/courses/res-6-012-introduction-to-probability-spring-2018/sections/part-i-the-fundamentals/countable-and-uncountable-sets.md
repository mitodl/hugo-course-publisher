title: Countable and Uncountable Sets
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="680">Probability models often involve infinite sample</span> <span
  m="4170">spaces, that is, infinite sets.</span></p><p><span m="8780">But not
  all sets are of the same kind.</span></p><p><span m="12570">Some sets are
  discrete and we call them countable, and some</span> <span m="17530">are
  continuous and we call them uncountable.</span></p><p><span m="20960">But what
  exactly is the difference between these two</span> <span m="23470">types of
  sets?</span></p><p><span m="24860">How can we define it
  precisely?</span></p><p><span m="27760">Well, let us start by first giving a
  definition of what it</span> <span m="31320">means to have a countable
  set.</span></p><p><span m="33920">A set will be called countable if its
  elements can be put</span> <span m="37530">into a 1-to-1 correspondence with
  the positive integers.</span></p><p><span m="41450">This means that we look at
  the elements of that set, and we</span> <span m="45280">take one element-- we
  call it the first element.</span></p><p><span m="47990">We take another
  element-- we call it the second.</span></p><p><span m="50790">Another, we call
  the third element, and so on.</span></p><p><span m="54090">And this way we
  will eventually exhaust all of the</span> <span m="58980">elements of the set,
  so that each one of those elements</span> <span m="62920">corresponds to a
  particular positive integer, namely the</span> <span m="66840">index that
  appears underneath.</span></p><p><span m="69140">More formally, what's
  happening is that we take</span> <span m="73110">elements of that set that are
  arranged in a sequence.</span></p><p><span m="78810">We look at the set, which
  is the entire range of values of</span> <span m="84420">that sequence, and we
  want that sequence to exhaust the</span> <span m="88580">entire set
  omega.</span></p><p><span m="91470">Or in other words, in simpler terms, we
  want to be able to</span> <span m="97250">arrange all of the elements of omega
  in a sequence.</span></p><p><span m="103360">So what are some examples of
  countable sets?</span></p><p><span m="106800">In a trivial sense, the positive
  integers themselves</span> <span m="110330">are countable, because we can
  arrange them in a sequence.</span></p><p><span m="114960">This is almost
  tautological, by the definition.</span></p><p><span m="118110">For a more
  interesting example, let's look at the set</span> <span m="120820">of all
  integers.</span></p><p><span m="122370">Can we arrange them in a
  sequence?</span></p><p><span m="124610">Yes, we can, and we can do it in this
  manner, where we</span> <span m="129669">alternate between positive and
  negative numbers.</span></p><p><span m="133330">And this way, we're going to
  cover all of the integers, and</span> <span m="136880">we have arranged them
  in a sequence.</span></p><p><span m="140190">How about the set of all pairs of
  positive integers?</span></p><p><span m="144870">This is less
  clear.</span></p><p><span m="147280">Let us look at this
  picture.</span></p><p><span m="148480">This is the set of all pairs of
  positive integers, which we</span> <span m="152560">understand to continue
  indefinitely.</span></p><p><span m="155590">Can we arrange this sets in a
  sequence?</span></p><p><span m="159450">It turns out that we
  can.</span></p><p><span m="160870">And we can do it by tracing a path of this
  kind.</span></p><p><span m="170130">So you can probably get the sense of
  how</span> <span m="172990">this path is going.</span></p><p><span
  m="174820">And by continuing this way, over and over, we're going to</span>
  <span m="180090">cover the entire set of all pairs of positive
  integers.</span></p><p><span m="185370">So we have managed to arrange them in
  a sequence.</span></p><p><span m="187840">So the set of all such pairs is
  indeed a countable set.</span></p><p><span m="191870">And the same argument
  can be extended to argue for the set</span> <span m="195160">of all triples of
  positive integers, or the set of all</span> <span m="199816">quadruples of
  positive integers, and so on.</span></p><p><span m="203350">This is actually
  not just a trivial mathematical point</span> <span m="208550">that we discuss
  for some curious reason, but it is</span> <span m="212270">because we will
  often have sample spaces</span> <span m="215280">that are of this
  kind.</span></p><p><span m="216960">And it's important to know that they're
  countable.</span></p><p><span m="221490">Now for a more subtle
  example.</span></p><p><span m="224079">Let us look at all rational numbers
  within the range</span> <span m="228070">between 0 and 1.</span></p><p><span
  m="230640">What do we mean by rational numbers?</span></p><p><span
  m="233140">We mean those numbers that can be expressed as a</span> <span
  m="236340">ratio of two integers.</span></p><p><span m="239050">It turns out
  that we can arrange them in a sequence,</span> <span m="242240">and we can do
  it as follows.</span></p><p><span m="244540">Let us first look at rational
  numbers that have a</span> <span m="247050">denominator term of
  2.</span></p><p><span m="249450">Then, look at the rational numbers that have
  a</span> <span m="252120">denominator term of 3.</span></p><p><span
  m="256140">Then, look at the rational numbers, always within this</span> <span
  m="259500">range of interest, that have a denominator of 4.</span></p><p><span
  m="266270">And then we continue similarly--</span> <span m="268780">rational
  numbers that have a denominator of 5, and so on.</span></p><p><span
  m="273630">This way, we're going to exhaust all of</span> <span m="275909">the
  rational numbers.</span></p><p><span m="277710">Actually, this number here
  already appeared there.</span></p><p><span m="282650">It's the same
  number.</span></p><p><span m="284030">So we do not need to include this in a
  sequence, but that's</span> <span m="287720">not an issue.</span></p><p><span
  m="289020">Whenever we see a rational number that has already been</span>
  <span m="292920">encountered before, we just delete it.</span></p><p><span
  m="296060">In the end, we end up with a sequence that goes over all of</span>
  <span m="300480">the possible rational numbers.</span></p><p><span
  m="302090">And so we conclude that the set of all rational numbers is</span>
  <span m="305310">itself a countable set.</span></p><p><span m="307500">So what
  kind of set would be uncountable?</span></p><p><span m="311350">An uncountable
  set, by definition, is a set that is</span> <span m="314240">not
  countable.</span></p><p><span m="315570">And there are examples of uncountable
  sets, most</span> <span m="319480">prominent, continuous subsets of the real
  line.</span></p><p><span m="324560">Whenever we have an interval, the unit
  interval, or any</span> <span m="328110">other interval that has positive
  length, that interval</span> <span m="331710">is an uncountable
  set.</span></p><p><span m="334290">And the same is true if, instead of an
  interval, we</span> <span m="337370">look at the entire real line, or we look
  at the</span> <span m="340490">two-dimensional plane, or
  three-dimensional</span> <span m="343330">space, and so on.</span></p><p><span
  m="344760">So all the usual sets that we think of as continuous sets</span>
  <span m="348960">turn out to be uncountable.</span></p><p><span m="352040">How
  do we know that they are uncountable?</span></p><p><span m="355040">There is
  actually a brilliant argument that establishes that</span> <span
  m="358640">the unit interval is uncountable.</span></p><p><span m="361650">And
  then the argument is easily extended to other</span> <span m="364360">cases,
  like the reals and the plane.</span></p><p><span m="367150">We do not need to
  know how this argument goes, for the</span> <span m="370240">purposes of this
  course.</span></p><p><span m="371820">But just because it is so beautiful, we
  will actually be</span> <span m="375930">presenting it to
  you.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
