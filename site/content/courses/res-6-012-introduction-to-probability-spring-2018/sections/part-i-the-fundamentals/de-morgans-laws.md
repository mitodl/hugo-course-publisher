title: De Morgan's Laws
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="1230">We will now discuss De Morgan's laws that are some</span>
  <span m="3780">very useful relations between sets and their
  complements.</span></p><p><span m="8109">One of the De Morgan's laws takes
  this form.</span></p><p><span m="11500">If we take the intersection of two
  sets and then take the</span> <span m="14360">complement of this intersection,
  what we obtain</span> <span m="17500">is the union of the complements of the
  two sets.</span></p><p><span m="21070">Pictorially, here is the
  situation.</span></p><p><span m="23840">We have our universal
  set.</span></p><p><span m="26680">Inside that set, we have a set, S, which is
  this one.</span></p><p><span m="34210">And we have another set, T, which is
  this one.</span></p><p><span m="40340">Let us look at this
  side.</span></p><p><span m="42840">The complement of S is this part of the
  diagram.</span></p><p><span m="47950">The complement of T is this part of the
  diagram.</span></p><p><span m="52950">What is left?</span></p><p><span
  m="54450">What is left is just this region here, which is the</span> <span
  m="57680">intersection of S with T. So anything that does not belong</span>
  <span m="63740">here belongs to the intersection.</span></p><p><span
  m="67010">This means that the complement of the intersection is</span> <span
  m="70950">everything out there, which is the set.</span></p><p><span
  m="74570">If you're not convinced by this pictorial proof, let us</span> <span
  m="78180">go through an argument that is a little more
  formal.</span></p><p><span m="82470">What does it take for an element to
  belong</span> <span m="86360">to the first set?</span></p><p><span
  m="89870">In order to belong to that set, x belongs to the</span> <span
  m="92729">complement of S intersection T. This is the same as saying</span>
  <span m="97539">that x does not belong to the intersection [of]</span> <span
  m="102020">S with T.</span></p><p><span m="104450">What does that
  mean?</span></p><p><span m="106370">Since it is not in the intersection, this
  is the same</span> <span m="109500">as saying that x does not belong to S or x
  does not</span> <span m="116940">belong to T. But this is the same as saying
  that x belongs</span> <span m="124640">to the complement of S or x belongs to
  the complement of</span> <span m="130580">T. And this is equivalent to saying
  that x belongs to the</span> <span m="137650">union of the complement of S
  with the complement of T.</span></p><p><span m="143310">So this establishes
  this first De Morgan's law.</span></p><p><span m="149750">There's another De
  Morgan's law, which is obtained from</span> <span m="153350">this one by a
  syntactic substitution.</span></p><p><span m="156110">We're going to play the
  following trick.</span></p><p><span m="158450">Wherever we see an S, we're
  going to replace it by S</span> <span
  m="162520">complement.</span></p><p><span m="163410">And wherever we see an S
  complement, we will replace it</span> <span m="167290">with an
  S.</span></p><p><span m="168620">And similarly, whenever we see a T, we'll
  replace it by T</span> <span m="172440">complement.</span></p><p><span
  m="173150">And when we see a T complement, we will replace it</span> <span
  m="176470">by T. So doing this syntactic substitution, what we obtain</span>
  <span m="181770">is S complement intersection with T complement--</span> <span
  m="186100">everything gets complemented--</span> <span m="188280">is the same
  as S union T.</span></p><p><span m="194200">Now, let us take complements of
  both sides.</span></p><p><span m="196560">The complement of a complement is
  the set itself.</span></p><p><span m="199760">So we obtain
  this.</span></p><p><span m="202690">And now, we take the complement of the
  other side,</span> <span m="205880">which is this one.</span></p><p><span
  m="207970">And this is the second De Morgan's law.</span></p><p><span
  m="211640">It tells us that the complement of a union is the</span> <span
  m="215930">same as the intersection of the complements.</span></p><p><span
  m="219270">We derived it from the first De Morgan's law by a syntactic</span>
  <span m="223010">substitution.</span></p><p><span m="223980">If you're not
  convinced, it would be useful for you to go</span> <span m="227630">through an
  argument of this kind to show that something is</span> <span m="232040">an
  element of this set if and only if it is an element of</span> <span
  m="235400">that set as well.</span></p><p><span m="237870">Finally, it turns
  out that De Morgan's laws are valid when</span> <span m="242000">we take
  unions or intersections of</span> <span m="244530">more than two
  sets.</span></p><p><span m="246480">There is a more general
  form.</span></p><p><span m="248390">And the general form is as
  follows--</span> <span m="251390">an analogy with this one.</span></p><p><span
  m="253370">If we have a collection of sets, Sn, perhaps an infinite</span>
  <span m="257089">collection, we take the intersection of those sets and</span>
  <span m="260160">then the complement, what that is is the union of the</span>
  <span m="264580">complements.</span></p><p><span m="266350">So this is
  analygous to this law.</span></p><p><span m="268540">And this law extends to
  this one: if we have the union of</span> <span m="272840">certain sets and we
  take the complement of the union, what</span> <span m="276455">we obtain is
  the intersection of the complements.</span></p><p><span m="281220">We will
  have many occasions to use De Morgan's laws.</span></p><p><span
  m="284409">They're actually very useful.</span></p><p><span m="286370">They
  allow us, in general, to go back and forth between</span> <span
  m="290230">unions and intersections.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
