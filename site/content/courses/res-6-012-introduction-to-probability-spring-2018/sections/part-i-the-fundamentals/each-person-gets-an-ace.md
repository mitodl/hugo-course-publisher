title: Each Person Gets An Ace
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="1240">We will now apply our multinomial formula for</span> <span
  m="4270">counting the number of partitions to solve the</span> <span
  m="7270">following probability problem.</span></p><p><span m="9510">We have a
  standard 52-card deck, which we</span> <span m="12690">deal to four
  persons.</span></p><p><span m="14190">Each person gets 13 cards as, for
  example, in bridge.</span></p><p><span m="18890">What is the probability that
  each person</span> <span m="21360">gets exactly one ace?</span></p><p><span
  m="24710">Well, before we start, as always we will need a</span> <span
  m="27500">probability model.</span></p><p><span m="29170">We deal the cards
  fairly, and this is going to be our model.</span></p><p><span m="34700">But we
  still need to interpret our statement.</span></p><p><span m="37760">To give
  this interpretation, let us first think of the</span> <span m="41200">outcomes
  of the experiment.</span></p><p><span m="42640">What are the possible
  outcomes?</span></p><p><span m="44250">An outcome of this experiment is a
  partition of the 52 cards</span> <span m="49440">into the four persons so that
  each person</span> <span m="52720">gets exactly 13 cards.</span></p><p><span
  m="55360">Our statement about dealing the cards fairly will be an</span> <span
  m="60050">assumption that all partitions are equally
  likely.</span></p><p><span m="72180">So since all partitions, all outcomes of
  the experiment,</span> <span m="75280">are equally likely, this means that we
  can solve a</span> <span m="78030">probability question by
  counting.</span></p><p><span m="80750">We need to count the number of elements
  of our sample space,</span> <span m="84070">the number of possible outcomes,
  and then count the</span> <span m="87200">number of outcomes that make the
  event</span> <span m="89820">of interest to occur.</span></p><p><span
  m="92370">Let us start with the number of elements</span> <span m="94360">of
  the sample space.</span></p><p><span m="96680">This is the problem that we
  just dealt with a</span> <span m="99810">little while ago--</span> <span
  m="101020">the number of outcomes, the number of partitions of 52</span> <span
  m="105250">items into four persons, where we give 13 cards to person</span>
  <span m="112015">one, 13 cards to person two, 13 cards to person three,
  and</span> <span m="118150">13 cards to person four.</span></p><p><span
  m="120700">The number of possible ways of doing this is equal to this</span>
  <span m="124700">multinomial coefficient.</span></p><p><span m="127160">So now
  let us count the number of outcomes that belong to the</span> <span
  m="130360">event of interest, namely the outcomes where each person</span>
  <span m="133980">gets an ace.</span></p><p><span m="136250">We think of the
  process of constructing such an outcome</span> <span m="139400">as a
  multi-stage process.</span></p><p><span m="140870">And we count the number of
  choices that we</span> <span m="142740">have at each stage.</span></p><p><span
  m="144579">The process is as follows.</span></p><p><span m="146890">We first
  distribute the four aces.</span></p><p><span m="150390">We take the ace of
  spades and give it to one person.</span></p><p><span m="153820">In how many
  ways can we do it?</span></p><p><span m="155620">We can do it in four
  ways.</span></p><p><span m="158690">Then we take the next
  ace.</span></p><p><span m="160660">The next ace must be given to a different
  person.</span></p><p><span m="163170">And so at that stage, we have three
  different choices about</span> <span m="166530">who to give that ace
  to.</span></p><p><span m="168750">Then we consider the next
  ace.</span></p><p><span m="171200">At this point, two persons already have
  aces.</span></p><p><span m="174220">So we have two available choices for who
  can</span> <span m="177610">get the next ace.</span></p><p><span
  m="179760">And finally for the last ace, we do not have any
  choice.</span></p><p><span m="182660">We give it to the only remaining person
  who doesn't</span> <span m="185370">yet have an ace.</span></p><p><span
  m="188510">Having distributed the four aces, then we need to somehow</span>
  <span m="193990">distribute the remaining 48 cards to the four
  people.</span></p><p><span m="199590">But we can do that in any way we
  want.</span></p><p><span m="202050">So all we need to do is to just partition
  the 48 cards</span> <span m="205950">into four subsets of given
  cardinalities.</span></p><p><span m="208950">And this can be done by a number
  of ways, which is the</span> <span m="214680">number of such
  partitions.</span></p><p><span m="216190">We have already found what that
  number is.</span></p><p><span m="219350">And it is this particular multinomial
  coefficient.</span></p><p><span m="226880">So the number of ways that we can
  distribute the cards so</span> <span m="230440">that each person gets an ace,
  according to the counting</span> <span m="233940">principle, is going to be
  the number of ways that we can</span> <span m="236870">distribute the aces
  times the number of ways that we can</span> <span m="240150">distribute the
  remaining cards.</span></p><p><span m="242060">The product of this number
  gives us the count, gives us</span> <span m="245860">the cardinality, of the
  event of interest.</span></p><p><span m="249510">We also have the cardinality
  of the sample space.</span></p><p><span m="252860">So the desired probability
  can be found by</span> <span m="255680">dividing these two
  numbers.</span></p><p><span m="258000">And the final answer takes this
  form.</span></p><p><span m="264810">Let us now look at the same problem
  but</span> <span m="267300">in a different way.</span></p><p><span
  m="268910">Probability problems can often be solved in multiple
  ways.</span></p><p><span m="272560">And some can be faster than
  others.</span></p><p><span m="275120">So we want to look for a smarter
  solution that perhaps</span> <span m="278690">will get us in a faster way to
  the desired answer.</span></p><p><span m="282970">We will use the following
  trick.</span></p><p><span m="285750">We will think about a very specific way
  of dealing the</span> <span m="288990">cards which is the
  following.</span></p><p><span m="291230">We take the 52 cards, the card deck,
  and stack it so that the</span> <span m="296210">four aces are at the
  top.</span></p><p><span m="299180">So they are first.</span></p><p><span
  m="301200">And then we deal those cards to the players as
  follows.</span></p><p><span m="305970">We think of each player having 13 slots
  of his own.</span></p><p><span m="312480">And the cards will be placed
  randomly into</span> <span m="316630">the different slots.</span></p><p><span
  m="319290">So we can do this one card at a time, starting from the
  top.</span></p><p><span m="324060">We take the first ace and send it to a
  random location.</span></p><p><span m="331380">Then we will take the second
  ace, send it to a random</span> <span m="334050">location, and so
  on.</span></p><p><span m="335930">What we want to calculate is the probability
  that the four</span> <span m="339780">aces will end up in locations or in
  slots that are</span> <span m="345150">associated with different
  persons.</span></p><p><span m="348320">So let us calculate this
  probability.</span></p><p><span m="350610">The first ace can go
  anywhere.</span></p><p><span m="352290">It doesn't matter.</span></p><p><span
  m="353710">For the second ace, it has 51 slots to choose
  from.</span></p><p><span m="359720">It's 51 because we started with 52, but
  one slot has</span> <span m="363120">already been taken by that particular
  ace.</span></p><p><span m="366130">So for the ace of hearts, we have 51
  slots</span> <span m="370430">that it can go to.</span></p><p><span
  m="372910">And out of those 51, we have 39 of them that belong to</span> <span
  m="378500">people who do not yet have an ace.</span></p><p><span m="380970">So
  this is the probability that the ace of hearts gets</span> <span
  m="384820">placed into a slot that belongs to a person who is</span> <span
  m="389110">different than the person who got the first ace.</span></p><p><span
  m="394180">Now let us consider this ace.</span></p><p><span m="396570">What is
  the probability that this ace will get into a slot</span> <span
  m="400890">which belongs to either this person or that
  person?</span></p><p><span m="404620">It has 26 slots in which this
  desired</span> <span m="410330">event is going to happen.</span></p><p><span
  m="412220">And it's 26 out of the 50 available slots.</span></p><p><span
  m="417280">Finally, let us consider this ace.</span></p><p><span m="420300">So
  having placed that ace and assuming that it got to a</span> <span
  m="423410">different person, what is the probability now that this ace</span>
  <span m="428060">is going to go to this person who doesn't yet have
  one?</span></p><p><span m="432760">The probability of this happening is the
  number of</span> <span m="435050">slots associated with that person, which is
  equal to 13</span> <span m="440060">divided by the number of slots that
  this</span> <span m="445580">card can choose from.</span></p><p><span
  m="447320">And the number of slots is 52 minus the 3 slots that have</span>
  <span m="451710">already been taken, so it's 49.</span></p><p><span
  m="456310">And so this is the answer to our problem.</span></p><p><span
  m="460280">This expression looks very different from the expression</span>
  <span m="462909">that we derived a little earlier.</span></p><p><span
  m="465520">But you can do the algebra, the arithmetic, simplify the</span>
  <span m="469210">answer, and you will verify that indeed it's exactly
  the</span> <span m="472560">same answer.</span></p><p><span m="473860">And in
  case you're curious, the numerical value turns out</span> <span m="478520">to
  be 0.105.</span></p><p><span m="481130">So there's about 10% [chance]</span>
  <span m="482880">that when you deal the cards in bridge, each one of
  the</span> <span m="485820">players is going to end up having exactly one
  ace.</span></p><p><span m="492100">So this was a faster way of getting to the
  answer to our</span> <span m="496230">problem, compared to the previous
  one.</span></p><p><span m="498860">But it raises a legitimate
  question.</span></p><p><span m="501750">Is the way that we dealt the cards by
  putting the aces on</span> <span m="505560">top and then dealing them, is that
  way a fair way</span> <span m="509530">of dealing the
  cards?</span></p><p><span m="511340">Is it true that with this way of dealing
  the cards all</span> <span m="514990">partitions are equally
  likely?</span></p><p><span m="518090">It turns out that this is indeed the
  case.</span></p><p><span m="521120">But it does require a bit of
  thinking.</span></p><p><span m="525210">Maybe you can see it
  intuitively</span> <span m="527530">that this is the case.</span></p><p><span
  m="529020">But if not, then it is something that one can
  prove.</span></p><p><span m="533290">It can be proved formally as
  follows.</span></p><p><span m="535850">One first needs to check that all
  permutations, that is all</span> <span m="541360">possible allocations of
  cards into</span> <span m="543940">slots, are equally
  likely.</span></p><p><span m="547270">And because of this, one can then argue
  that any possible</span> <span m="552420">partition into subsets of
  [13]</span> <span m="556250">is also equally likely.</span></p><p><span
  m="558280">So this is an equivalent way of dealing the cards to the</span>
  <span m="562160">one that we considered earlier, which was that every</span>
  <span m="565330">partition is equally likely.</span></p><p><span
  m="567710">Therefore, we did indeed solve the same problem, and so this</span>
  <span m="571350">is a legitimate alternative way of getting to the
  answer.</span></p><p><span m="575650">And of course, it's reassuring to check
  that this numerical</span> <span m="579140">expression agrees with the
  numerical expression we had</span> <span m="581940">derived
  earlier.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
