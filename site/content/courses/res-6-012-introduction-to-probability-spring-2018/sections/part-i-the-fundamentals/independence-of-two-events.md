title: Independence of Two Events
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="840">In the previous example, we had a model where the
  result</span> <span m="3890">of the first coin toss did not affect the
  probabilities of</span> <span m="7620">what might happen in the second
  toss.</span></p><p><span m="10270">This is a phenomenon that we call
  independence and which we</span> <span m="13580">now proceed to
  define.</span></p><p><span m="15660">Let us start with a first attempt at the
  definition.</span></p><p><span m="18230">We have an event, B, that has a
  certain</span> <span m="20280">probability of occurring.</span></p><p><span
  m="22160">We are then told that event A occurred, but suppose that</span>
  <span m="26050">this knowledge does not affect our beliefs about B in
  the</span> <span m="31230">sense that the conditional probability remains the
  same</span> <span m="34800">as the original unconditional
  probability.</span></p><p><span m="38290">Thus, the occurrence of A provides
  no new information</span> <span m="41800">about B. In such a case, we may say
  that event B is</span> <span m="47230">independent from event
  A.</span></p><p><span m="50000">If this is indeed the case, notice that the
  probability</span> <span m="53420">that both A and B occur, which is always
  equal by the</span> <span m="62120">multiplication rule to the probability of
  A times the</span> <span m="65960">conditional probability of B given A. So
  this is a relation</span> <span m="71630">that's always
  true.</span></p><p><span m="72890">But if we also have this additional
  condition, then</span> <span m="77100">this simplifies to the probability of A
  times the</span> <span m="80810">probability of B.</span></p><p><span
  m="86280">So we can find the probability of both events happening by</span>
  <span m="90780">just multiplying their individual
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="95240">It turns out that this relation is
  a cleaner way of</span> <span m="99720">the defining formally the notion of
  independence.</span></p><p><span m="103420">So we will say that two events, A
  and B, are</span> <span m="107060">independent if this relation
  holds.</span></p><p><span m="111610">Why do we use this definition rather than
  the original one?</span></p><p><span m="116120">This formal definition has
  several advantages.</span></p><p><span m="119950">First, it is consistent with
  the earlier definition.</span></p><p><span m="124300">If this equality is
  true, then the conditional probability of</span> <span m="129960">event B
  given A, which is the ratio of this divided by that,</span> <span
  m="136400">will be equal to the probability of B. So if this</span> <span
  m="140510">relation holds, then this relation will also hold, and</span> <span
  m="145250">so this more formal definition is consistent with our
  earlier</span> <span m="150160">intuitive definition.</span></p><p><span
  m="152710">A more important reason is that this formal definition is</span>
  <span m="156370">symmetric with respect to the roles of A and B. So
  instead</span> <span m="160780">of saying that B is independent from A, based
  on</span> <span m="165210">this definition we can now say that events A and B
  are</span> <span m="169640">independent of each other.</span></p><p><span
  m="172420">And in addition, since this definition is symmetric and</span>
  <span m="176400">since it implies this condition, it must also imply</span>
  <span m="181440">the symmetrical relation.</span></p><p><span
  m="183010">Namely, that the conditional probability of A given B is</span>
  <span m="186230">the same as the unconditional probability of
  A.</span></p><p><span m="189770">Finally, on the technical side,
  conditional</span> <span m="193320">probabilities are only defined when the
  conditioning event</span> <span m="197000">has non-zero
  probability.</span></p><p><span m="199150">So this original definition would
  only make sense in those</span> <span m="203060">cases where the probability
  of the event A would be non-zero.</span></p><p><span m="208490">In contrast,
  this new definition makes sense even</span> <span m="212100">when we're
  dealing with zero probability events.</span></p><p><span m="215800">So this
  definition is indeed more general, and this also</span> <span m="219690">makes
  it more elegant.</span></p><p><span m="222490">Let us now build some
  understanding of what</span> <span m="224740">independence really
  is.</span></p><p><span m="226970">Suppose that we have two events, A and B,
  both of which</span> <span m="230870">have positive
  probability.</span></p><p><span m="234380">And furthermore, these two events
  are disjoint.</span></p><p><span m="237640">They do not have any common
  elements.</span></p><p><span m="239860">Are these two events
  independent?</span></p><p><span m="242380">Let us check the
  definition.</span></p><p><span m="244330">The probability that both A and B
  occur is zero because</span> <span m="251720">the two events are
  disjoint.</span></p><p><span m="253900">They cannot happen
  together.</span></p><p><span m="255760">On the other hand, the probability of
  A times the</span> <span m="259390">probability of B is positive, since each
  one of the two</span> <span m="263350">terms is positive.</span></p><p><span
  m="265890">And therefore, these two expressions are different from</span>
  <span m="269280">each other, and therefore this equality that's required
  by</span> <span m="273210">the definition of independence does not
  hold.</span></p><p><span m="276290">The conclusion is that these two events
  are not</span> <span m="279180">independent.</span></p><p><span m="280290">In
  fact, intuitively, these two events are as dependent as</span> <span
  m="283930">Siamese twins.</span></p><p><span m="285510">If you know that A
  occurred, then you are sure</span> <span m="288710">that B did not
  occur.</span></p><p><span m="290530">So the occurrence of A tells you a lot
  about the occurrence</span> <span m="295140">or non-occurrence of
  B.</span></p><p><span m="297700">So we see that being independent is
  something</span> <span m="300280">completely different from being
  disjoint.</span></p><p><span m="303680">Independence is a relation about
  information.</span></p><p><span m="307730">It is important to always keep in
  mind the intuitive meaning</span> <span m="311270">of
  independence.</span></p><p><span m="312450">Two events are independent if the
  occurrence of one event</span> <span m="316750">does not change our beliefs
  about the other.</span></p><p><span m="320660">It does not affect the
  probability that the other</span> <span m="323560">event also
  occurs.</span></p><p><span m="326600">When do we have independence in the real
  world?</span></p><p><span m="329640">The typical case is when the occurrence
  or non-occurrence</span> <span m="333650">of each of the two events A and B is
  determined by two</span> <span m="337590">physically distinct and
  non-interacting processes.</span></p><p><span m="341720">For example, whether
  my coin results in heads and whether</span> <span m="345230">it will be
  snowing on New Year's Day are two events that</span> <span m="348530">should
  be modeled as independent.</span></p><p><span m="351250">But I should also say
  that there are some cases where</span> <span m="353610">independence is less
  obvious and where it happens through a</span> <span m="356940">numerical
  accident.</span></p><p><span m="359610">You can now move on to answer some
  simple questions where</span> <span m="362730">you will have to check for
  independence using either the</span> <span m="365700">mathematical or
  intuitive definition.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
