transcript: >-
  <p><span m="620">We are defining a random variable as a real valued</span>
  <span m="3520">function on the sample space.</span></p><p><span m="5430">So
  this is a good occasion to make sure that we understand</span> <span
  m="7960">what a function is.</span></p><p><span m="10130">To define a
  function, we start with two sets.</span></p><p><span m="13670">One
  set--</span> <span m="14740">call it A--</span> <span m="16160">is the domain
  of the function.</span></p><p><span m="20420">And we have our second
  set.</span></p><p><span m="23520">Then a function is a rule that for any
  element of A</span> <span m="29800">associates an element of B. And we use a
  notation of this</span> <span m="36940">kind to indicate that we are dealing
  with a function f that</span> <span m="41700">maps elements of A into elements
  of B.</span></p><p><span m="47470">Now, two elements of A may be mapped to the
  same element of</span> <span m="52050">B. This is allowed.</span></p><p><span
  m="55640">What is important, however, is that every element of A is</span>
  <span m="60320">mapped to exactly one element of B, not
  more.</span></p><p><span m="64810">But it is also possible that we have some
  elements of B</span> <span m="68590">that do not correspond to any of the
  elements of A.</span></p><p><span m="73050">Now, I said that a function is a
  rule that assigns points of</span> <span m="76770">A to points in B. But what
  exactly do we mean by a rule?</span></p><p><span m="82240">If we want to be
  more precise, a function would</span> <span m="85410">be defined as
  follows.</span></p><p><span m="87270">It would be defined as a set of pairs of
  values.</span></p><p><span m="92690">It would be a set of pairs of the form x,
  y such that x is</span> <span m="99560">always an element of A, y is always an
  element of B, and</span> <span m="105890">also-- most important--</span> <span
  m="107740">each x in A appears in exactly one pair.</span></p><p><span
  m="120030">So this would be a formal definition of</span> <span
  m="122890">what a function is.</span></p><p><span m="124330">It is collection
  of ordered pairs of this kind.</span></p><p><span m="129000">As a concrete
  example, let us start with the set consisting</span> <span m="134590">of these
  elements here.</span></p><p><span m="138880">And let B be the set of real
  numbers.</span></p><p><span m="144079">And consider the function that
  corresponds to what we usually</span> <span m="149100">call the
  square.</span></p><p><span m="150610">So it's a function that squares its
  argument.</span></p><p><span m="154320">Then this function would be
  represented by the following</span> <span m="158030">collection of
  pairs.</span></p><p><span m="161710">So this is the value of
  x.</span></p><p><span m="165690">And this is the corresponding value of
  y.</span></p><p><span m="168820">Any particular x shows up just once in
  this</span> <span m="174130">collection of pairs.</span></p><p><span
  m="176890">But a certain y--</span> <span m="178250">for example, y equal to
  1--</span> <span m="180210">shows up twice, because minus 1 and plus 1 both
  map to the</span> <span m="184960">same element of B.</span></p><p><span
  m="188360">Now, this is a representation in terms of ordered
  pairs.</span></p><p><span m="193030">But we could also think of the function
  as being</span> <span m="196070">described by a table.</span></p><p><span
  m="198770">We could, for instance, put this information here in a</span> <span
  m="205340">form of a table of this kind and say that this table</span> <span
  m="210320">describes the function.</span></p><p><span m="211560">For any
  element x, it tells us what the</span> <span m="213800">corresponding element
  y is.</span></p><p><span m="216710">However, when the set A is an infinite set
  it is not clear</span> <span m="220450">what we might mean by saying a table,
  an infinite table,</span> <span m="224640">whereas this definition in terms
  of</span> <span m="226480">ordered pairs still applies.</span></p><p><span
  m="229310">For example, if you're interested in the function</span> <span
  m="233470">which is, again, the square function from the real</span> <span
  m="236490">numbers, the way you would specify that function</span> <span
  m="240790">abstractly would be as follows.</span></p><p><span m="243540">You
  could write, it's the set of all pairs of this form such</span> <span
  m="253480">that x is a real number.</span></p><p><span m="258420">And now such
  pairs, of course, belong to the two dimensional</span> <span m="263530">plane
  because it's a pair of numbers.</span></p><p><span m="266350">So this set here
  can be viewed as a formal definition or a</span> <span
  m="269880">specification of the squaring function.</span></p><p><span
  m="272960">Now, what this set is is something that we</span> <span
  m="276050">can actually plot.</span></p><p><span m="277540">If we go in the
  two dimensional plane, the points</span> <span m="280670">of this form are
  exactly the points that belong to the</span> <span m="284980">graph of the
  square function.</span></p><p><span m="287810">So this abstract definition,
  really all that it says is</span> <span m="291070">that a function is the same
  thing as the</span> <span m="293310">plot of that function.</span></p><p><span
  m="295550">But it's important here to make a distinction.</span></p><p><span
  m="298810">The function is the entire plot--</span> <span m="302720">so this
  set here is the function f--</span> <span m="306270">whereas if I tell you a
  specific number x, the</span> <span m="310400">corresponding value here would
  be f of x.</span></p><p><span m="314240">So here x is a number and f of x is
  also a number.</span></p><p><span m="319370">And those two values, x and f of
  x, define this particular</span> <span m="323510">point on this
  plot.</span></p><p><span m="325490">But the function itself is the entire
  plot.</span></p><p><span m="330141">Let us also take this occasion to talk a
  little bit about the</span> <span m="334159">notation and the proper way of
  talking about functions.</span></p><p><span m="338430">Here is the most common
  way that one</span> <span m="341510">would describe a
  function.</span></p><p><span m="343890">And this is an appropriate
  way.</span></p><p><span m="346320">We've described the
  domain.</span></p><p><span m="348520">We've described the set on which
  the</span> <span m="350780">function takes values.</span></p><p><span
  m="352480">And I'm telling you for any x in that set what the value of</span>
  <span m="356710">the function is.</span></p><p><span m="358596">On the other
  hand, sometimes people use a more loose</span> <span m="362060">language, such
  as for example, they would say,</span> <span m="365190">the function x
  squared.</span></p><p><span m="367250">What does that mean?</span></p><p><span
  m="368420">Well, what this means is exactly this statement.</span></p><p><span
  m="373700">Now let us consider this function.</span></p><p><span
  m="376310">The function f--</span> <span m="378850">again, from the reals to
  the reals--</span> <span m="380660">that's defined by f of z equal to z
  squared.</span></p><p><span m="384440">Is this a different function or is it
  the same function?</span></p><p><span m="387530">It's actually the same
  function, because these two</span> <span m="391870">involve the same
  sets.</span></p><p><span m="393710">And they produce their outputs, the values
  of f,</span> <span m="397680">using exactly the same rule.</span></p><p><span
  m="400010">They take an argument and they square that
  argument.</span></p><p><span m="403480">Now, if you were to use informal
  notation, you would</span> <span m="406860">be referring to that second
  function as</span> <span m="409430">the function z squared.</span></p><p><span
  m="412120">And now, if you use informal language, it's less clear that</span>
  <span m="415420">the function x squared and the function z squared are one
  and</span> <span m="418750">the same thing, whereas with this terminology
  here, it</span> <span m="422740">would be pretty clear that we're
  talking</span> <span m="425110">about the same function.</span></p><p><span
  m="427460">Finally, suppose that we have already defined a
  function.</span></p><p><span m="430960">How should we refer to it in
  general?</span></p><p><span m="434870">Should we call it the function f, or
  should we say the</span> <span m="438620">function f of x?</span></p><p><span
  m="440780">Well, when x is a number, f of x is also a
  number.</span></p><p><span m="444840">So f of x is not really a
  function.</span></p><p><span m="447760">The appropriate language is this
  one.</span></p><p><span m="450270">We talk about the function f, although
  quite often, people</span> <span m="454400">will abuse language and they will
  use this terminology.</span></p><p><span m="457590">But it's important to keep
  in mind what we really mean.</span></p><p><span m="461800">The idea is that we
  need to think of a function as some</span> <span m="465970">kind of box or
  even a computer program, if you wish, that</span> <span m="471520">takes
  inputs and produces outputs.</span></p><p><span m="475640">And there's a
  distinction between f, which is the box,</span> <span m="479770">from the
  value f of x that the function takes if we feed it</span> <span
  m="484310">with a specific argument.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
