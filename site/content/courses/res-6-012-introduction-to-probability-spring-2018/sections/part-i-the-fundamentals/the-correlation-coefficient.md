transcript: >-
  <p><span m='580'>The covariance between two random variables</span> <span
  m='3220'>tells us something about the strength</span> <span m='4930'>of the
  dependence between them.</span> </p><p><span m='7160'>But it is not so easy to
  interpret qualitatively.</span> </p><p><span m='9890'>For example, if I tell
  you that the covariance of X and Y</span> <span m='13100'>is equal to 5, this
  does not tell you</span> <span m='15690'>very much about whether X and Y are
  closely related or not.</span> </p><p><span m='20990'>Another difficulty is
  that if X and Y are in units,</span> <span m='25300'>let's say, of meters,
  then the covariance</span> <span m='27830'>will have units of meters
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='30760'>And this is hard to interpret.</span>
  </p><p><span m='32820'>A much more informative quantity is the so-called
  correlation</span> <span m='36160'>coefficient, which is a dimensionless
  version</span> <span m='39880'>of the covariance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='41960'>It is defined by this formula here.</span> </p><p><span m='45750'>We
  just take the covariance and divide it</span> <span m='48480'>by the product
  of the standard deviations of the two</span> <span m='51430'>random
  variables.</span> </p><p><span m='53210'>Now, if X has units of meters, then
  the standard deviation</span> <span m='57660'>also has units of meters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='60140'>And so this ratio will be dimensionless.</span>
  </p><p><span m='63430'>And it is not affected by the units that we're
  using.</span> </p><p><span m='66300'>The same is true for this ratio
  here,</span> <span m='68990'>and this is why the correlation coefficient does
  not</span> <span m='73100'>have any units of its own.</span> </p><p><span
  m='76090'>One remark-- if we're dealing with a random variable whose</span>
  <span m='80330'>standard deviation is equal to 0--</span> <span m='83450'>so
  its variance is also equal to 0--</span> <span m='85850'>then we have a random
  variable, which</span> <span m='87890'>is identically equal to a
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='90460'>Well, for such cases of degenerate
  random variables,</span> <span m='93620'>then the correlation coefficient is
  not</span> <span m='95700'>defined, because it would have involved a division
  by 0.</span> </p><p><span m='100450'>A very important property of the
  correlation coefficient</span> <span m='103500'>is the following.</span>
  </p><p><span m='104940'>It turns out that the correlation coefficient</span>
  <span m='107220'>is always between minus 1 and 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='110440'>And this allows us to judge whether a certain correlation</span>
  <span m='114130'>coefficient is big or not, because we now</span> <span
  m='116930'>have an absolute scale.</span> </p><p><span m='118789'>And so it
  does provide a measure of the degree to which two</span> <span
  m='123070'>random variables are associated.</span> </p><p><span m='125530'>To
  interpret the correlation coefficient,</span> <span m='127620'>let's now look
  at some extreme cases.</span> </p><p><span m='130820'>Suppose that X and Y are
  independent.</span> </p><p><span m='134820'>In that case, we know that the
  covariance</span> <span m='137570'>is going to be equal to 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='139490'>And therefore, the correlation coefficient</span>
  <span m='141480'>is also going to be equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143780'>And in that case, we say that the two random variables</span> <span
  m='146690'>are uncorrelated.</span> </p><p><span m='148590'>However, the
  converse statement is not true.</span> </p><p><span m='152810'>We have seen
  already an example in which we</span> <span m='155960'>have zero covariance
  and therefore zero correlation,</span> <span m='159310'>but yet the two random
  variables were dependent.</span> </p><p><span m='164220'>Let us now look at
  the other extreme,</span> <span m='166130'>where the two random variables
  are</span> <span m='168400'>as dependent as they can be.</span> </p><p><span
  m='171180'>So let's look at the correlation coefficient</span> <span
  m='173300'>of one random variable with itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='176840'>What is it going to be?</span> </p><p><span m='178520'>The
  covariance of a random variable with itself</span> <span m='181650'>is just
  the variance of that random variable, now,</span> <span m='187090'>sigma X is
  going to be the same as sigma Y,</span> <span m='189950'>because we're taking
  Y to be the same as X.</span> </p><p><span m='192900'>So we're dividing by
  sigma X squared.</span> </p><p><span m='195260'>But the square of the standard
  deviation is the variance.</span> </p><p><span m='198420'>So we obtain a value
  of 1.</span> </p><p><span m='201500'>So a correlation coefficient of 1</span>
  <span m='203579'>shows up in such a case of an extreme dependence.</span>
  </p><p><span m='207770'>If instead we had taken the correlation coefficient of
  X</span> <span m='211220'>with the negative of X, in that case,</span> <span
  m='214510'>we would have obtained a correlation coefficient</span> <span
  m='217200'>of minus 1.</span> </p><p><span m='221540'>A somewhat more general
  situation</span> <span m='223400'>than the one we considered here is the
  following.</span> </p><p><span m='227970'>If we have two random variables
  that</span> <span m='230800'>have a linear relationship-- that is, if I know
  Y</span> <span m='234560'>I can figure out the value of X with absolute
  certainty,</span> <span m='238540'>and I can figure it out by using a linear
  formula.</span> </p><p><span m='242600'>In this case, it turns out that the
  correlation coefficient</span> <span m='246840'>is either plus 1 or minus
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='249660'>And the converse is true.</span>
  </p><p><span m='251380'>If the correlation coefficient has absolute value of
  1,</span> <span m='254310'>then the two random variables obey</span> <span
  m='255820'>a deterministic linear relation between them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='259899'>So to conclude, an extreme value for the correlation
  coefficient</span> <span m='264380'>of plus or minus 1 is equivalent to
  having</span> <span m='268280'>a deterministic relation between the two random
  variables</span> <span m='271730'>involved.</span> </p><p><span m='273820'>A
  final remark about the algebraic properties</span> <span m='276500'>of the
  correlation coefficient- What can we</span> <span m='280530'>say about the
  correlation coefficient</span> <span m='282250'>of a linear function of a
  random variable with another?</span> </p><p><span m='286450'>Well, we already
  know something about what</span> <span m='288760'>happens to the covariance
  when we form a linear function.</span> </p><p><span m='292280'>And the
  covariance of aX plus b with Y is related this way</span> <span m='297430'>to
  the covariance of X with Y. Now, let us use this property</span> <span
  m='301980'>and calculate the correlation coefficient between aX</span> <span
  m='304830'>plus b and Y.</span> </p><p><span m='306630'>In the numerator, we
  have the covariance of aX</span> <span m='310010'>plus b with Y, which is
  equal to a times</span> <span m='313890'>the covariance of X with Y. At the
  denominator,</span> <span m='320640'>we have the standard deviation of this
  random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='327120'>Now, the standard deviation of
  this random variable</span> <span m='330310'>is equal to a times the standard
  deviation of X,</span> <span m='334450'>if a is positive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='336080'>If a is negative, then we need to put the minus sign.</span>
  </p><p><span m='339110'>But in either case, we will have here the absolute
  value</span> <span m='343450'>of a times the standard deviation</span> <span
  m='345940'>of X. And then we divide by the standard deviation</span> <span
  m='349030'>of the second random variable, which is Y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='352370'>And so what we obtain here is this ratio, which</span> <span
  m='357080'>is a correlation coefficient of X with Y times</span> <span
  m='361840'>this quantity, which is the sign of a.</span> </p><p><span
  m='367160'>So we have the sign of a times the correlation coefficient</span>
  <span m='371690'>of X with Y. So in particular, the magnitude</span> <span
  m='375950'>of the correlation coefficient is not</span> <span m='378050'>going
  to change when we replace X by aX plus b.</span> </p><p><span m='382370'>And
  this essentially means that if we</span> <span m='384210'>change the units of
  the random variable X,</span> <span m='387280'>for example, suppose that X was
  degrees</span> <span m='389300'>Celsius and aX plus b is degrees Fahrenheit,
  going</span> <span m='394180'>from one set of units, Celsius degrees,</span>
  <span m='397850'>to another set of units, degrees in Fahrenheit,</span> <span
  m='401490'>is not going to change the correlation</span> <span
  m='403570'>coefficient of the temperature with some other random</span> <span
  m='406909'>variable.</span> </p><p><span m='408690'>So this is a nice property
  of the correlation coefficient,</span> <span m='411380'>again, which reflects
  the fact that it's dimensionless,</span> <span m='414710'>it doesn't have any
  units of its own,</span> <span m='417490'>and it doesn't depend on what kinds
  of units</span> <span m='420120'>we use for each one of the random
  variables.</span> </p>
