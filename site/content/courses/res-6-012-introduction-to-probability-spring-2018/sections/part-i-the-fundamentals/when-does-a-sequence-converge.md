title: When Does a Sequence Converge?
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="1370">So we looked at the formal definition of what it
  means</span> <span m="4480">for a sequence to converge, but as a practical
  matter, how</span> <span m="8210">can we tell whether a given sequence
  converges or not?</span></p><p><span m="13080">There are two criteria that are
  the most commonly used for</span> <span m="16309">that purpose, and it's
  useful to be aware of them.</span></p><p><span m="20690">The first one deals
  with the case where we have a sequence</span> <span m="24210">of numbers that
  keep increasing, or at least, they</span> <span m="28500">do not go
  down.</span></p><p><span m="30380">In that case, those numbers may go up
  forever without any</span> <span m="37210">bound, so if you look at any
  particular value, there's</span> <span m="41180">going to be a time at which
  the sequence has</span> <span m="44740">exceeded that
  value.</span></p><p><span m="46700">In that case, we say that the
  sequence</span> <span m="49350">converges to infinity.</span></p><p><span
  m="51680">But if this is not the case, if it does not converge to</span> <span
  m="55810">infinity, which means that the entries of the</span> <span
  m="58800">sequence are bounded--</span> <span m="61180">they do not grow
  arbitrarily large--</span> <span m="64230">then, in that case, it is
  guaranteed that the sequence</span> <span m="69360">will converge to a certain
  number.</span></p><p><span m="72760">This is not something that we will
  attempt to prove, but it</span> <span m="76180">is a useful fact to
  know.</span></p><p><span m="79900">Another way of establishing convergence is
  to derive some</span> <span m="84580">bound on the distance or our sequence
  from the number that</span> <span m="89060">we suspect to be the
  limit.</span></p><p><span m="92440">If that distance becomes smaller and
  smaller, if we can</span> <span m="97039">manage to bound that distance by a
  certain number and that</span> <span m="101550">number goes down to 0, then it
  is guaranteed that since this</span> <span m="107789">distance goes down to 0,
  that the sequence, ai,</span> <span m="110900">converges to
  a.</span></p><p><span m="112850">And there's a variation of this argument,
  which is the</span> <span m="115400">so-called sandwich argument, and it goes
  as follows.</span></p><p><span m="120330">If we have a certain sequence that
  converges to some number,</span> <span m="125050">a, and we have another
  sequence that converges to</span> <span m="130090">that same number, a, and
  our sequence is somewhere</span> <span m="135070">in-between, then our
  sequence must also converge to that</span> <span m="140750">particular number,
  a.</span></p><p><span m="143620">So these are the usual ways of quickly saying
  something about</span> <span m="149040">the convergence of a given sequence,
  and we will be often</span> <span m="152970">using this type of argument in
  this class, but without making</span> <span m="157160">a big fuss about them,
  or without even referring to</span> <span m="162190">these facts in an
  explicit manner.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
