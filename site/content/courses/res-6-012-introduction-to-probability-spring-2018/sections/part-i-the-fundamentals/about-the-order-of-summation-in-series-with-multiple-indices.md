title: About the Order of Summation in Series with Multiple Indices
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="220">We now continue our discussion of infinite
  series.</span></p><p><span m="3410">Sometimes we have to deal with series
  where the terms being</span> <span m="6350">added are indexed by multiple
  indices, as in</span> <span m="9710">this example here.</span></p><p><span
  m="11220">We're given numbers, aij, and i ranges over all</span> <span
  m="15710">the positive integers.</span></p><p><span m="17390">j also ranges
  over all the positive integers.</span></p><p><span m="21910">So what does this
  sum represent?</span></p><p><span m="25250">We can think of it as
  follows.</span></p><p><span m="27480">We have here a two-dimensional grid that
  corresponds to all</span> <span m="31330">the pairs (i,j).</span></p><p><span
  m="33750">And in essence, each one of those points corresponds to</span> <span
  m="37290">one of the terms that we want to add.</span></p><p><span
  m="40280">So we can sum the different terms in some arbitrary
  order.</span></p><p><span m="43840">Let's say we start from
  here.</span></p><p><span m="45430">Take that term, add this term, then add
  this term here, then</span> <span m="50950">add this term, then the next term,
  next term, and so on.</span></p><p><span m="55570">And we can keep going that
  way, adding the different</span> <span m="59640">terms according to some
  sequence.</span></p><p><span m="62850">So essentially, what we're doing here
  is we're taking</span> <span m="66220">this two-dimensional grid and arranging
  the terms associated</span> <span m="71470">with that grid, in some particular
  linear order.</span></p><p><span m="74950">And we're summing those terms in
  sequence.</span></p><p><span m="79090">As long as this sum converges to
  something as we keep adding</span> <span m="85220">more and more terms, then
  this double series</span> <span m="89010">will be well
  defined.</span></p><p><span m="90800">Notice, however, we can add those terms
  in</span> <span m="93930">many different orders.</span></p><p><span
  m="96100">And in principle, those different orders might give us</span> <span
  m="99320">different kinds of results.</span></p><p><span m="101490">On the
  other hand, as long as the sum of the absolute values</span> <span
  m="107979">of all the terms turns out to be finite, then the particular</span>
  <span m="114090">order in which we're adding the different terms will
  turn</span> <span m="118190">out that it doesn't matter.</span></p><p><span
  m="122240">There's another way that we can add the terms together,</span>
  <span m="125620">and this is the following.</span></p><p><span m="127500">Let
  us consider fixing a particular choice of i, and</span> <span
  m="133860">adding all of the terms that are associated with this</span> <span
  m="138000">particular choice of i, as j ranges from 1 to
  infinity.</span></p><p><span m="143300">So what we're doing is we're taking
  the summation from j</span> <span m="148980">equal to 1 to infinity, while
  keeping the value of i fixed.</span></p><p><span m="157160">We do this for
  every possible i.</span></p><p><span m="159450">So for every possible i, we're
  going to get</span> <span m="161970">a particular number.</span></p><p><span
  m="163810">And then we take the numbers that we obtain for the</span> <span
  m="167360">different choices if i, so i ranges from 1 to
  infinity.</span></p><p><span m="173170">And we add all those terms
  together.</span></p><p><span m="176700">So this is one particular order, one
  particular way of</span> <span m="180230">doing the infinite
  summation.</span></p><p><span m="182720">Now, why start with the summation
  over j's while</span> <span m="186600">keeping i fixed?</span></p><p><span
  m="188090">There's no reason for that.</span></p><p><span m="189790">We could
  also carry out the summation by fixing a</span> <span m="194410">particular
  choice of j and summing over all i's.</span></p><p><span m="199880">So now it
  is i that ranges from 1 to infinity.</span></p><p><span m="205500">And we look
  at this infinite sum.</span></p><p><span m="208650">This is the infinite sum
  of those terms.</span></p><p><span m="211170">We obtain one such infinite sum
  for every choice of j.</span></p><p><span m="215780">And then we take that sum
  that we obtain for any particular</span> <span m="219720">choice of j, and add
  over the different</span> <span m="223880">possible values of
  j.</span></p><p><span m="225860">So j goes from 1 to
  infinity.</span></p><p><span m="228510">This is a different way of carrying
  out the summation.</span></p><p><span m="231700">And these are going to give
  us the same result, and the same</span> <span m="236490">result that we would
  also obtain if we were to add the</span> <span m="239610">terms in this
  particular order, as long as the double</span> <span m="245060">series is
  well-defined, in the following sense.</span></p><p><span m="249020">If we have
  a guarantee that the sum of the absolute values</span> <span m="253030">of
  those numbers is finite, no matter which way we add them,</span> <span
  m="257970">then it turns out that we can use any particular order to</span>
  <span m="262110">add the terms in the series.</span></p><p><span
  m="263810">We're going to get the same result.</span></p><p><span
  m="265750">And we can also carry out the double summation by doing--</span>
  <span m="270540">by adding over one index at a time.</span></p><p><span
  m="275440">A word of caution--</span> <span m="277540">this condition is not
  always satisfied.</span></p><p><span m="280690">And in those cases, strange
  things can happen.</span></p><p><span m="283970">Suppose that the sequences
  we're dealing with, the aij's,</span> <span m="289620">take those particular
  values indicated in this picture.</span></p><p><span m="294110">And all the
  remaining terms, the aij's associated with the</span> <span m="298450">other
  dots, are all 0's.</span></p><p><span m="301150">So all these terms out there
  will be 0's.</span></p><p><span m="305930">If we carry out the summation by
  fixing a j and adding over</span> <span m="312230">all i's, what we get here
  is 0, and a 0, and a 0, and a 0.</span></p><p><span m="319270">That's because
  in each row we have a 1 and a minus 1, which</span> <span m="324020">cancel
  out and give us 0's.</span></p><p><span m="326560">So if we carry out the
  summation in this manner, we</span> <span m="332960">get a sum of 0's, which
  is 0.</span></p><p><span m="339940">But if we carry out the summation in this
  order, fix</span> <span m="343540">an i, and then add over all j's, the first
  term that we</span> <span m="348380">get here is going to be 1, because in
  this column, this</span> <span m="353270">is the only non-zero
  number.</span></p><p><span m="354980">And then in the remaining columns, as we
  add the terms,</span> <span m="358510">we're going to get 0's, and 0's, and so
  on.</span></p><p><span m="363060">And so if we carry out the summation in this
  way, we</span> <span m="366970">obtain a 1.</span></p><p><span m="368500">So
  this is an example that shows you that the order of</span> <span
  m="372010">summation actually may matter.</span></p><p><span m="375670">In
  this example, the sum of the absolute values of all of</span> <span
  m="379160">the terms that are involved is infinity, because we have</span>
  <span m="382780">infinitely many plus or minus 1's, so this condition here
  is</span> <span m="387780">not satisfied in this example.</span></p><p><span
  m="394380">Let us now consider the case where we want to add the terms</span>
  <span m="398110">of a double sequence, but over a limited range of indices
  as</span> <span m="402800">in this example, where we have coefficients aij,
  which we</span> <span m="406490">want to add, but only for those i's and j's
  for which j</span> <span m="410690">is less than or equal to
  i.</span></p><p><span m="413580">Graphically, this means that we only want to
  consider the</span> <span m="417420">pairs shown in this
  picture.</span></p><p><span m="419909">So these points here correspond to i,j
  pairs for</span> <span m="424470">which i is equal to j.</span></p><p><span
  m="426690">Terms on the right, or points to the right, correspond to</span>
  <span m="431200">i,j pairs for which i is at least as large as
  j.</span></p><p><span m="436400">We can carry out this summation in two
  ways.</span></p><p><span m="439550">One way is the
  following.</span></p><p><span m="441740">We fix a value of i, and we consider
  all of the</span> <span m="445720">corresponding terms, that correspond to
  different</span> <span m="449550">choices of j.</span></p><p><span
  m="451640">But we only go up to the point where i is equal to
  j.</span></p><p><span m="457320">This is the largest term.</span></p><p><span
  m="459230">So what are we doing here?</span></p><p><span m="461159">We're
  taking the coefficients aij, and we are adding over</span> <span
  m="466960">all j's, starting from 1, which</span> <span m="471360">corresponds
  to this term.</span></p><p><span m="472840">And j goes up to the point where
  it becomes equal to i.</span></p><p><span m="478560">We do this for every
  value of i.</span></p><p><span m="481330">And so we get a number for the sum
  of each one of the</span> <span m="485470">columns, and then we add those
  numbers together.</span></p><p><span m="490650">So we're adding over all i's,
  and i ranges</span> <span m="494350">from 1 up to infinity.</span></p><p><span
  m="496300">This is one way of carrying out the summation.</span></p><p><span
  m="499670">Alternatively, we could fix a value of j, and consider doing</span>
  <span m="504770">the summation over all choices of i.</span></p><p><span
  m="508090">So this corresponds to the sum over all</span> <span
  m="512039">choices of i, from where?</span></p><p><span m="515169">The
  smallest term, the first term, happens when i is equal</span> <span
  m="519690">to the value of j.</span></p><p><span m="522780">And then we have
  larger choices of i, numbers for</span> <span m="527610">which i is bigger
  than the corresponding value of j.</span></p><p><span m="530880">And so i
  ranges from j all the way to infinity.</span></p><p><span m="536460">And this
  is the sum over one of the rows in this diagram.</span></p><p><span
  m="541260">We do this for every j.</span></p><p><span m="543140">We get a
  result, and then we need to add all</span> <span m="546130">those results
  together.</span></p><p><span m="547840">So we're summing for all j's from 1 up
  to infinity.</span></p><p><span m="555170">So these are two different ways
  that we can evaluate this</span> <span m="560050">series associated with a
  double sequence.</span></p><p><span m="563550">We can either add over all j's
  first and then over i's, or we</span> <span m="568060">can sum over all i's
  first, and then over all j's.</span></p><p><span m="573960">The two ways of
  approaching this problem, this summation,</span> <span m="579010">should give
  us the same answer.</span></p><p><span m="581210">And this is going to be,
  again, subject to the usual</span> <span
  m="585210">qualification.</span></p><p><span m="586440">As long as the sum of
  the absolute values of the terms</span> <span m="590830">that we're trying to
  add is less than infinity--</span> <span m="594320">if this condition is true,
  then the two ways of carrying</span> <span m="598800">out the summation are
  equal, and they're just two different</span> <span
  m="602650">alternatives.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
