transcript: >-
  <p><span m="1560">In this segment, we will talk about sets.</span></p><p><span
  m="4240">I'm pretty sure that most of what I will say is material</span> <span
  m="7770">that you have seen before.</span></p><p><span m="9540">Nevertheless,
  it is useful to do a review of some of the</span> <span m="12430">concepts,
  the definitions, and also of the notation that we</span> <span m="15640">will
  be using.</span></p><p><span m="17000">So what is a set?</span></p><p><span
  m="18490">A set is just a collection of distinct elements.</span></p><p><span
  m="22530">So we have some elements, and we put them
  together.</span></p><p><span m="26110">And this collection, we call it the set
  S.</span></p><p><span m="30290">More formally, how do we specify a
  set?</span></p><p><span m="33000">We could specify a set by listing its
  elements, and</span> <span m="37330">putting them inside
  braces.</span></p><p><span m="39360">So this is a set that consists of four
  elements, the letters,</span> <span m="42190">a, b, c, d.</span></p><p><span
  m="44090">Another set could be the set of all real numbers.</span></p><p><span
  m="49990">Notice a distinction here--</span> <span m="51940">the first set is
  a finite set.</span></p><p><span m="54940">It has a finite number of elements,
  whereas the second</span> <span m="59060">set is infinite.</span></p><p><span
  m="60570">And in general, sets are of these two kinds.</span></p><p><span
  m="63460">Either they're finite, or their infinite.</span></p><p><span
  m="67820">A piece of notation now.</span></p><p><span m="70210">We use this
  notation to indicate that a certain object</span> <span m="74710">x is an
  element of a set S. We read that as x belongs to S.</span></p><p><span
  m="81840">If x is not an element of S, then we use this notation to</span>
  <span m="86700">indicate it, and we read it as x does not belong to
  S.</span></p><p><span m="92229">Now, one way of specifying sets is as
  follows.</span></p><p><span m="96130">We start with a bigger set-- for
  example,</span> <span m="99160">the set of real numbers--</span> <span
  m="101070">and we consider all of those x's that belong to that big</span>
  <span m="105130">set that have a certain property.</span></p><p><span
  m="108030">For example, that the cosine of this number is, let's say,</span>
  <span m="112560">bigger than 1/2.</span></p><p><span m="114320">This is a way
  of specifying a set.</span></p><p><span m="116150">We start with a big set,
  but we then restrict to those</span> <span m="119670">elements of that set
  that satisfy a particular property.</span></p><p><span m="124860">One set of
  particular interest is the following.</span></p><p><span m="128430">Sometimes
  in some context, we want to fix a collection of</span> <span m="133800">all
  possible objects that we might ever want to consider,</span> <span
  m="137740">and that collection will be a set.</span></p><p><span m="141410">We
  denote it usually by omega, and we call it</span> <span m="145000">the
  universal set.</span></p><p><span m="147840">So having fixed a universal set,
  we will only consider</span> <span m="153040">smaller sets that lie inside
  that big universal set.</span></p><p><span m="160400">And once we have a
  universal set, we can talk about the</span> <span m="164520">collection of all
  objects, or elements, that belong to our</span> <span m="169590">universal
  set, but do not belong to the set S. So that</span> <span m="175010">would be
  everything outside the set S.</span></p><p><span m="179170">Everything outside
  the set S, we denote it this way, and we</span> <span m="183690">call it the
  complement of the set S. And it is defined</span> <span m="187730">formally as
  follows--</span> <span m="190330">an element belongs to the complement of S if
  x is an</span> <span m="197000">element of our universal set, and also x does
  not belong to</span> <span m="203640">S. Notice that if we take the complement
  of the complement--</span> <span m="209590">that is, anything that does not
  belong to the green set--</span> <span m="212740">we get back the red
  set.</span></p><p><span m="215000">So what this is saying is that the
  complement of the</span> <span m="219930">complement of a set is the set
  itself.</span></p><p><span m="225760">Another set of particular interest is
  the</span> <span m="228730">so-called empty set.</span></p><p><span
  m="231320">The empty set is a set that contains no
  elements.</span></p><p><span m="236480">In particular, if we take the
  complement of</span> <span m="239480">the universal set--</span> <span
  m="241050">well, since the universal set contains everything, there is</span>
  <span m="244270">nothing in its complement, so its complement is going to
  be</span> <span m="247510">the empty set.</span></p><p><span
  m="250610">Finally, one more piece of notation.</span></p><p><span
  m="254270">Suppose that we have two sets, and one set is</span> <span
  m="258579">bigger than the other.</span></p><p><span m="260180">So S is the
  small set here, and T is the bigger set.</span></p><p><span m="265290">We
  denote this relation by writing this expression, which</span> <span
  m="271100">we read as follows--</span> <span m="272400">S is a subset of the
  set T.</span></p><p><span m="275120">And what that means is that if x is an
  element of S, then</span> <span m="282300">such an x must be also an element
  of T. Note that when S</span> <span m="288930">is a subset of T, there is also
  the possibility that S is</span> <span m="293520">equal to T. One word of
  caution here--</span> <span m="298540">the notation that we're using here is
  the same as what in</span> <span m="302960">some textbooks is written this
  way--</span> <span m="307000">that is, S is a subset of T, but can also be
  equal to T. We</span> <span m="311230">do not use this notation, but that's
  how we understand it.</span></p><p><span m="315320">That is, we allow for the
  possibility that the subset is</span> <span m="318970">equal to the larger
  set.</span></p><p><span m="322080">Now when we have two sets, we can talk
  about their union and</span> <span m="328560">their
  intersection.</span></p><p><span m="330860">Let's say that this is set S, and
  this is set T. The union</span> <span m="334930">of the two sets consists of
  all elements that belong to</span> <span m="339540">one set or the other, or
  in both.</span></p><p><span m="342980">The union is denoted this way, and the
  formal definition is</span> <span m="348470">that some element belongs to the
  union if and only if this</span> <span m="355310">element belongs to one of
  the sets, or it belongs to the</span> <span m="360780">other one of the
  sets.</span></p><p><span m="364270">We can also form the intersection of two
  sets,</span> <span m="368060">which we denote this way, and which stands for
  the</span> <span m="371300">collection of elements that belong to both of the
  sets.</span></p><p><span m="375350">So formally, an element belongs to the
  intersection of</span> <span m="378790">two sets if and only if that
  element</span> <span m="382890">belongs to both of them.</span></p><p><span
  m="386020">So x must be an element of S, and it must also be an element</span>
  <span m="390670">of T.</span></p><p><span m="393180">By the way, we can also
  define unions and intersections of</span> <span m="397630">more than two sets,
  even of infinitely many sets.</span></p><p><span m="402580">So suppose that we
  have an infinite collection of sets.</span></p><p><span m="406140">Let's
  denote them by Sn.</span></p><p><span m="408600">So n ranges over, let's say,
  all of the positive integers.</span></p><p><span m="414190">So pictorially,
  you might think of having one set,</span> <span m="418780">another set, a
  third set, a fourth set, and so on, and we</span> <span m="422570">have an
  infinite collection of such sets.</span></p><p><span m="425970">Given this
  infinite collection, we can still</span> <span m="428480">define their union
  to be the set of all elements that</span> <span m="434890">belong to one of
  those sets Sn that we started with.</span></p><p><span m="440060">That is, an
  element is going to belong to that union if and</span> <span m="444830">only
  if this element belongs to some of the sets that we</span> <span
  m="452300">started with.</span></p><p><span m="456680">We can also define the
  intersection of an infinite</span> <span m="459960">collection of
  sets.</span></p><p><span m="461810">We say that an element x belongs to the
  intersection of</span> <span m="466010">all these sets if and only if x
  belongs to Sn for all n.</span></p><p><span m="475409">So if x belongs to each
  one of those Sn's, then we say that x</span> <span m="480450">belongs to their
  intersection.</span></p><p><span m="482840">Set operations satisfy certain
  basic properties.</span></p><p><span m="487560">One of these we already
  discussed.</span></p><p><span m="491290">This property, for example, is pretty
  clear.</span></p><p><span m="494100">The union of a set with another set is
  the same as the</span> <span m="497740">union if you consider the two sets in
  different orders.</span></p><p><span m="501820">If you take the union of three
  sets, you can do it by</span> <span m="504980">forming, first, the union of
  these two sets, and then the</span> <span m="508060">union with this one; or,
  do it in any alternative order.</span></p><p><span m="511700">Both expressions
  are equal.</span></p><p><span m="513330">Because of this, we do not really
  need the parentheses,</span> <span m="516260">and we often write just this
  expression here, which is the</span> <span m="520820">same as this
  one.</span></p><p><span m="523090">And the same would be true for
  intersections.</span></p><p><span m="526540">That is, the intersection of
  three sets is the same no</span> <span m="531920">matter how you put
  parentheses around the different sets.</span></p><p><span m="539640">Now if
  you take a union of a set with a universal set, you</span> <span
  m="543140">cannot get anything bigger than the universal set, so you</span>
  <span m="545950">just get the universal set.</span></p><p><span m="547970">On
  the other hand, if you take the intersection of a set with</span> <span
  m="553170">the universal set, what is left is just the set
  itself.</span></p><p><span m="559320">Perhaps the more complicated properties
  out of this list is</span> <span m="565080">this one and this one, which are
  sort of a distributive</span> <span m="570790">property of intersections and
  unions.</span></p><p><span m="574100">And I will let you convince
  yourselves</span> <span m="576820">that these are true.</span></p><p><span
  m="578420">The way that you verify them is by proceeding
  logically.</span></p><p><span m="582730">If x is an element of this, then x
  must be an element of</span> <span m="588510">S, and it must also be an
  element of either T or U.</span></p><p><span m="593580">Therefore, it's going
  to belong either to this set--</span> <span m="598550">it belongs to S, and it
  also belongs to T-- or it's going</span> <span m="601720">to be an element of
  that set-- it belongs to S, and it</span> <span m="605150">belongs to
  U.</span></p><p><span m="607300">So this argument shows that this set here is
  a</span> <span m="610920">subset of that set.</span></p><p><span
  m="612580">Anything that belongs here belongs there.</span></p><p><span
  m="614930">Then you need to reverse the argument to convince yourself</span>
  <span m="618630">that anything that belongs here belongs also to the
  first</span> <span m="621840">set, and therefore, the two sets are
  equal.</span></p><p><span m="624890">Here, I'm using the following fact-- that
  if S is a subset</span> <span m="628020">of T, and T is a subset of S, this
  implies that the</span> <span m="632410">two sets are
  equal.</span></p><p><span m="634640">And then you can use a similar argument
  to convince</span> <span m="637070">yourselves about this equality, as
  well.</span></p><p><span m="642190">So this is it about basic properties of
  sets.</span></p><p><span m="645850">We will be using some of these properties
  all of the time</span> <span m="649290">without making any special comment
  about them.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
