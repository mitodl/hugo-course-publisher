title: Independence Versus Pairwise Independence
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="2040">We will now consider an example that illustrates the</span>
  <span m="5440">difference between the notion of independence of a</span> <span
  m="9030">collection of events and the notion of pairwise</span> <span
  m="12990">independence within that collection.</span></p><p><span
  m="16460">The model is simple.</span></p><p><span m="18290">We have a fair
  coin which we flip twice.</span></p><p><span m="22700">So at each flip, there
  is probability 1/2</span> <span m="25460">of obtaining
  heads.</span></p><p><span m="28950">Furthermore, we assume that the two flips
  are independent</span> <span m="32340">of each other.</span></p><p><span
  m="33770">Let H1 be the event that the first coin toss resulted in</span>
  <span m="38760">heads, which corresponds to this event in this
  diagram.</span></p><p><span m="46370">Let H2 be the event that the second toss
  resulted in heads,</span> <span m="51700">which is this event in the
  diagram--</span> <span m="56570">the two ways that we can have the second toss
  being heads.</span></p><p><span m="64800">Now, we're assuming that the tosses
  are independent.</span></p><p><span m="68590">So the event heads-heads has a
  probability which is equal to</span> <span m="73500">the probability that the
  first toss resulted in heads--</span> <span m="76539">that's 1/2--</span>
  <span m="77390">times the probability that the second toss resulted in
  heads,</span> <span m="80200">which is 1/2.</span></p><p><span m="81460">So
  the product is 1/4.</span></p><p><span m="83730">We have probability 1/4 for
  this outcome.</span></p><p><span m="86880">Now, the total probability of event
  H1 is 1/2, which means</span> <span m="91430">that the probability of what
  remains should be 1/4, so that</span> <span m="96560">the sum of these two
  numbers is 1/2.</span></p><p><span m="99320">By the same argument, the
  probability of this outcome,</span> <span m="102270">tails-heads , should be
  1/4.</span></p><p><span m="105880">We have a total of 3/4.</span></p><p><span
  m="107940">So what's left is 1/4.</span></p><p><span m="110070">And that's
  going to be the probability of the outcome</span> <span m="113080">tails-tails
  .</span></p><p><span m="115500">Let us now introduce a new event, namely the
  event that</span> <span m="121470">the two tosses had the same
  result.</span></p><p><span m="125040">So this is the event that we obtain
  either heads heads or</span> <span m="130728">tails-tails.</span></p><p><span
  m="134210">Schematically, event C corresponds to this blue</span> <span
  m="138560">region in the diagram.</span></p><p><span m="141290">Is this event
  C independent from the events H1 and H2?</span></p><p><span m="146760">Let us
  first look for pairwise independence.</span></p><p><span m="150520">Let's look
  at the probability that H1 occurs</span> <span m="154440">and C occurs as
  well.</span></p><p><span m="157150">So the first toss resulted in
  heads.</span></p><p><span m="159820">And the two tosses had the same
  result.</span></p><p><span m="163060">So this is the same as the probability
  of obtaining heads</span> <span m="167200">followed by
  heads.</span></p><p><span m="171340">And this corresponds to just this outcome
  that has</span> <span m="174780">probability 1/4.</span></p><p><span
  m="179930">How about the product of the probabilities of H1 and of
  C?</span></p><p><span m="187250">Is it the same?</span></p><p><span
  m="189242">Well, the probability of H1 is 1/2.</span></p><p><span
  m="195240">And the probability of C--</span> <span m="196900">what is
  it?</span></p><p><span m="197850">Event C consists of two
  outcomes.</span></p><p><span m="201450">Each one of these outcomes has
  probability 1/4.</span></p><p><span m="204030">So the total is, again,
  1/2.</span></p><p><span m="207550">And therefore, the product of these
  probabilities is 1/4.</span></p><p><span m="212430">So we notice that the
  probability of the two events</span> <span m="214829">happening is the same as
  the product of their individual</span> <span m="218020">probabilities, and
  therefore, H1 and C</span> <span m="222370">are independent
  events.</span></p><p><span m="226610">By the same argument, H2 and C are going
  to be independent.</span></p><p><span m="232500">It's a symmetrical
  situation.</span></p><p><span m="235690">H1 and H2 are also independent from
  each other.</span></p><p><span m="239940">So we have all of the conditions for
  pairwise</span> <span m="242740">independence.</span></p><p><span
  m="244470">Let us now check whether we have independence.</span></p><p><span
  m="248710">To check for independence, we need to also look into the</span>
  <span m="252730">probability of all three events happening and see</span>
  <span m="256329">whether it is equal to the product of the individual</span>
  <span m="259070">probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="260420">So the
  probability of all three events happening--</span> <span m="263770">this is
  the probability that H1 occurs and H2</span> <span m="267450">occurs and C
  occurs.</span></p><p><span m="270750">What is this event?</span></p><p><span
  m="274260">Heads in the first toss, heads in the second toss, and the</span>
  <span m="277460">two tosses are the same--</span> <span m="279770">this
  happens if and only if the outcome is</span> <span m="284280">heads followed
  by heads.</span></p><p><span m="286780">And this has probability
  1/4.</span></p><p><span m="291060">On the other hand, if we calculate the
  probability of</span> <span m="294480">H1 times the probability of H2 times
  the probability of C, we</span> <span m="301850">get 1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2,
  which is 1/8.</span></p><p><span m="307490">These two numbers are
  different.</span></p><p><span m="310900">And therefore, one of the conditions
  that we had for</span> <span m="315020">independence is
  violated.</span></p><p><span m="318340">So in this example, H1, H2, and C are
  pairwise</span> <span m="323800">independent, but they're not independent in
  the sense of an</span> <span m="329040">independent collection of
  events.</span></p><p><span m="332330">How are we to understand this
  intuitively?</span></p><p><span m="337800">If I tell you that event H1
  occurred and I ask you for the</span> <span m="346520">conditional probability
  of C given that H1</span> <span m="349940">[occurred], what is
  this?</span></p><p><span m="353050">This is the probability that we obtain,
  given that the</span> <span m="357360">first event is heads, the first result
  is heads, the</span> <span m="361790">only way that you can have the two
  tosses having the same</span> <span m="365030">result is going to be in the
  second toss also</span> <span m="368970">resulting in
  heads.</span></p><p><span m="372020">And since H2 and H1 are independent, this
  is just the</span> <span m="375680">probability that we have heads in the
  second toss.</span></p><p><span m="379340">And this number is
  1/2.</span></p><p><span m="382110">And 1/2 is also the same as the probability
  of C. That's</span> <span m="386720">another way of understanding the
  independence of H1 and C.</span></p><p><span m="391380">Given that the first
  toss resulted in heads, this does</span> <span m="396510">not help you in any
  way in guessing whether the two</span> <span m="401580">tosses will have the
  same result or not.</span></p><p><span m="405750">The first one was heads, but
  the second one could be either</span> <span m="409290">heads or tails with
  equal probability.</span></p><p><span m="412870">So event H1 does not carry
  any useful information about the</span> <span m="417670">occurrence or
  non-occurrence of event C. On the other hand,</span> <span m="424210">if I
  were to tell you that both events, H1 and H2,</span> <span
  m="432210">happened, what would the conditional</span> <span
  m="434560">probability of C be?</span></p><p><span m="437560">If both H1 and
  H2 occurred, then the results of the two</span> <span m="441250">coin tosses
  were identical, so you know that C also occurred.</span></p><p><span
  m="447400">So this probability is equal to 1.</span></p><p><span
  m="451540">And this number, 1, is different from the</span> <span
  m="456000">unconditional probability of C, which is 1/2.</span></p><p><span
  m="461040">So we have here a situation where knowledge of H1 having</span>
  <span m="466190">occurred does not help you in making a better guess on</span>
  <span m="471409">whether C is going to occur.</span></p><p><span m="473980">H1
  by itself does not carry any useful information.</span></p><p><span
  m="477490">But the two events together, H1 and H2, do carry useful</span>
  <span m="482320">information about C.</span></p><p><span m="483630">Once you
  know that H1 and H2 occurred, then C</span> <span m="486360">is certain to
  occur.</span></p><p><span m="488040">So your original probability for C, which
  was 1/2, now gets</span> <span m="492430">revised to a value of
  1.</span></p><p><span m="494610">So H1 and H2 carry information relevant to C.
  And therefore,</span> <span m="499720">C is not independent from these two
  events collectively.</span></p><p><span m="505290">And we say that events
  H1.</span></p><p><span m="508810">H2, and C are not
  independent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
