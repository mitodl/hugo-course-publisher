transcript: >-
  <p><span m="900">Let us now conclude with a fun problem, which is also
  a</span> <span m="4100">little bit of a puzzle.</span></p><p><span m="5970">We
  are told that the king comes from a</span> <span m="8210">family of two
  children.</span></p><p><span m="10460">What is the probability that his
  sibling is female?</span></p><p><span m="13980">Well, the problem is too
  loosely stated, so we need to</span> <span m="17220">start by making some
  assumptions.</span></p><p><span m="19370">First, let's assume that we're
  dealing with an anachronistic</span> <span m="22800">kingdom where boys have
  precedence.</span></p><p><span m="29930">In other words, if the royal family
  has two children, one</span> <span m="34640">of which is a boy and one is a
  girl, it is always the boy who</span> <span m="38960">becomes king, even if
  the girl was born first.</span></p><p><span m="43830">Let us also assume that
  when a child is born, it has 50%</span> <span m="48380">probability of being a
  boy and 50%</span> <span m="51820">probability of being a
  girl.</span></p><p><span m="58890">And in addition, let's assume that
  different children are</span> <span m="63790">independent as far as their
  gender is concerned.</span></p><p><span m="70070">Given these assumptions,
  perhaps we</span> <span m="72850">can argue as follows.</span></p><p><span
  m="75240">The king's sibling is a child which is</span> <span
  m="78620">independent from the king.</span></p><p><span m="80600">Its gender
  is independent from the king's gender, so it's</span> <span m="84710">going to
  be a girl with probability 1/2.</span></p><p><span m="89160">And so this is
  one possible answer to this problem.</span></p><p><span m="94750">Is this a
  correct answer?</span></p><p><span m="96770">Well, let's
  see.</span></p><p><span m="97640">We have to make a more precise model, so
  let's</span> <span m="100710">go ahead with it.</span></p><p><span
  m="102180">We have two children, so there are four possible outcomes--</span>
  <span m="107460">boy, boy; boy, girl; girl, boy; and girl,
  girl.</span></p><p><span m="115780">Each one of these outcomes has probability
  1/4 according to</span> <span m="121290">our assumptions.</span></p><p><span
  m="122920">For example, the probability of a boy followed by a boy is</span>
  <span m="125750">1/2 times 1/2, where we're also using
  independence.</span></p><p><span m="130960">So each one of these four outcomes
  has the same</span> <span m="135150">probability, 1/4.</span></p><p><span
  m="139660">Now, we know that there is a king, so there must be at</span> <span
  m="143740">least one boy.</span></p><p><span m="145720">Given this
  information, one of the outcomes becomes</span> <span m="150560">impossible,
  namely the outcome girl, girl.</span></p><p><span m="155050">And we're
  restricted to a smaller universe with only</span> <span m="159150">three
  possible outcomes.</span></p><p><span m="161620">Our new universe is this
  green universe, which includes all</span> <span m="165470">outcomes that have
  at least one boy, so that</span> <span m="168100">we can get a
  king.</span></p><p><span m="170930">We should, therefore, use the conditional
  probabilities that</span> <span m="174530">are appropriate to this new
  universe.</span></p><p><span m="177590">Since these three outcomes inside the
  green set have</span> <span m="181920">equal unconditional probabilities, they
  should</span> <span m="185170">also have equal conditional
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="188460">So each one of these three
  outcomes should have a</span> <span m="192230">conditional probability equal
  to 1/3.</span></p><p><span m="197079">In two of these outcomes the sibling is
  a girl and</span> <span m="201340">therefore, the conditional probability
  given that there</span> <span m="205275">is a king and therefore given that
  there is a boy, the</span> <span m="208930">conditional probability is going
  to be 2/3.</span></p><p><span m="214570">So this is actually the official
  answer to this</span> <span m="217680">problem, and this answer is
  incorrect.</span></p><p><span m="223610">Are we satisfied with this
  answer?</span></p><p><span m="225960">Maybe yes, maybe no.</span></p><p><span
  m="228760">Actually, some more assumptions are needed in</span> <span
  m="232579">order to say that 2/3 is the correct answer.</span></p><p><span
  m="236290">Let me state what these assumptions are.</span></p><p><span
  m="240160">We assume that the royal family decided to have exactly</span>
  <span m="244960">two children.</span></p><p><span m="246830">So the number two
  that we have here is not random.</span></p><p><span m="251900">It was
  something that was predetermined.</span></p><p><span m="254760">Once they
  decided to have the two children, they had them.</span></p><p><span
  m="260140">At least one turned out to be a boy and that</span> <span
  m="263720">boy became a king.</span></p><p><span m="266460">Under this
  situation, indeed, the probability that the</span> <span m="270780">sibling of
  the king is female is 2/3.</span></p><p><span m="276540">But these assumptions
  that I just stated are not the only</span> <span m="279760">possible
  ones.</span></p><p><span m="281840">Let's consider some alternative
  assumptions.</span></p><p><span m="286040">For example, suppose that the
  royal</span> <span m="288190">family operated as follows.</span></p><p><span
  m="291110">They decided to have children until they get one
  boy.</span></p><p><span m="300820">What does this tell us?</span></p><p><span
  m="302610">Well, since they had two children, this tells us</span> <span
  m="306080">something--</span> <span m="306660">that the first child was a
  girl.</span></p><p><span m="313170">So in this case, the probability that the
  king's</span> <span m="316110">sibling is a girl is equal to
  1.</span></p><p><span m="320340">The only reason why they had two children was
  because the</span> <span m="323350">first was a girl and then the second was a
  boy.</span></p><p><span m="327570">Suppose that the royal family made some
  different choices.</span></p><p><span m="330890">They decided to have children
  until they would get two boys,</span> <span m="336670">just to be sure that
  the line of succession was secured.</span></p><p><span m="341190">In this
  case, if we are told that there are only two</span> <span m="345520">children,
  this means that there were exactly two boys,</span> <span m="351460">because
  if one of the two children was a girl, the royal</span> <span
  m="354220">family would have continued.</span></p><p><span m="356170">So in
  this particular case, the probability that the</span> <span m="359720">sibling
  is a girl is equal to zero.</span></p><p><span m="362970">And you can think of
  other scenarios, as well, that might</span> <span m="365970">give you
  different answers.</span></p><p><span m="369610">So 2/3 is the official
  answer, as long as we make the precise</span> <span m="375330">assumptions
  that the number of children, the number two, was</span> <span
  m="379120">predetermined before anything else happened.</span></p><p><span
  m="384280">The general moral from this story is that when we deal</span> <span
  m="387070">with situations that are described in words somewhat</span> <span
  m="390440">vaguely, we must be very careful to state whatever</span> <span
  m="394010">assumptions are being made.</span></p><p><span m="396090">And that
  needs to be done before we are able to fix a</span> <span
  m="399909">particular probabilistic model.</span></p><p><span m="403050">This
  process of modeling will always be something of an art</span> <span
  m="407710">in which judgment calls will have to be
  made.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
