title: Conditional Independence
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="1940">Conditional probabilities are like ordinary
  probabilities,</span> <span m="5900">except that they apply to a new situation
  where some</span> <span m="8680">additional information is
  available.</span></p><p><span m="11210">For this reason, any concept relevant
  to probability models</span> <span m="14850">has a counterpart that applies
  to</span> <span m="17520">conditional probability models.</span></p><p><span
  m="20050">In this spirit, we can define a notion of conditional</span> <span
  m="23230">independence, which is nothing but the notion of independence</span>
  <span m="27440">applied to a conditional model.</span></p><p><span
  m="29840">Let us be more specific.</span></p><p><span m="31720">Suppose that
  we have a probability model and two</span> <span m="34590">events, A and B. We
  are then told that event C occurred,</span> <span m="42190">and we construct a
  conditional model.</span></p><p><span m="44690">Conditional independence is
  defined as ordinary</span> <span m="47250">independence but with respect to
  the conditional</span> <span m="50100">probabilities.</span></p><p><span
  m="51430">To be more precise, remember that independence is defined</span>
  <span m="56420">in terms of this relation, that the probability of two</span>
  <span m="59710">events happening is the product of the probabilities</span>
  <span m="63840">that one of them is happening times the probability that
  the</span> <span m="67780">other one is happening.</span></p><p><span
  m="70890">This is the definition of independence in the original</span> <span
  m="75240">unconditional model.</span></p><p><span m="77350">Now, in the
  conditional model we just use the same relation,</span> <span m="81950">but
  with conditional probabilities instead of</span> <span m="86960">ordinary
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="89050">So this is the definition of
  conditional independence.</span></p><p><span m="94190">We may now ask, is
  there a relation between independence</span> <span m="98170">and conditional
  independence?</span></p><p><span m="100100">Does one imply the
  other?</span></p><p><span m="102120">Let us look at an
  example.</span></p><p><span m="104789">Suppose that we have two events and
  these two events</span> <span m="108160">are independent.</span></p><p><span
  m="110320">We then condition on another event, C. And suppose that the</span>
  <span m="114440">picture is like the one shown here.</span></p><p><span
  m="119220">Are A and B conditionally independent?</span></p><p><span
  m="125460">Well, in the new universe where C has happened, events A</span>
  <span m="130850">and B have no intersection.</span></p><p><span m="133860">As
  we discussed earlier this means that events A and B are</span> <span
  m="137290">extremely dependent.</span></p><p><span m="139180">Within G, if A
  occurs, this tells us that B did not occur.</span></p><p><span m="147240">The
  conclusion from this example is that independence</span> <span m="151440">does
  not imply conditional independence.</span></p><p><span m="155090">So in this
  particular example, we saw that the</span> <span m="158090">answer here is
  no.</span></p><p><span m="160160">Given C, A and B are not
  independent.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
