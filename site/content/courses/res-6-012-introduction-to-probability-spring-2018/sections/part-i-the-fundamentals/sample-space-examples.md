transcript: >-
  <p><span m='2660'>Let us now look at some examples of sample spaces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6270'>Sample spaces are sets.</span> </p><p><span m='8640'>And
  a set can be discrete, finite, infinite,</span> <span m='12430'>continuous,
  and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='13880'>Let us start with a simpler case in
  which we have a sample</span> <span m='17730'>space that is discrete and
  finite.</span> </p><p><span m='20620'>The particular experiment we will
  be</span> <span m='22930'>looking at is the following.</span> </p><p><span
  m='25340'>We take a very special die, a tetrahedral die.</span> </p><p><span
  m='29300'>So it's a die that has four faces numbered from 1 up 4.</span>
  </p><p><span m='34590'>We roll it once.</span> </p><p><span m='36730'>And then
  we roll it twice [again].</span> </p><p><span m='39280'>Were not dealing here
  with two probabilistic experiments.</span> </p><p><span m='42090'>We're
  dealing with a single probabilistic experiment that</span> <span
  m='45430'>involves two rolls of the die within that experiment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='50120'>What is the sample space of that experiment?</span>
  </p><p><span m='52960'>Well, one possible</span> <span
  m='54170'>representation is the following.</span> </p><p><span m='56770'>We
  take note of the result of the first roll.</span> </p><p><span m='60480'>And
  then we take note of the result of the second roll.</span> </p><p><span
  m='64220'>And this gives us a pair of numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='67050'>Each one of the possible pairs of numbers corresponds to one</span>
  <span m='70950'>of the little squares in this diagram.</span> </p><p><span
  m='73450'>For example, if the first roll is 1 and the second is also 1,</span>
  <span m='78280'>then this particular outcome has occurred.</span> </p><p><span
  m='81990'>If the first roll is it 2 and the second is a 3, then this</span>
  <span m='87060'>particular outcome occurs.</span> </p><p><span m='89780'>If
  the first roll is a 3 and then the next one is a 2, then</span> <span
  m='93950'>this particular outcome occurs.</span> </p><p><span m='96580'>Notice
  that these two outcomes are pretty closely related.</span> </p><p><span
  m='100250'>In both cases, we observe a 2 and we observe a 3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='103840'>But we distinguish those two outcomes because in those
  two</span> <span m='108050'>outcomes, the 2 and the 3 happen in different
  order.</span> </p><p><span m='112500'>And the order in which they appear may
  be a detail which</span> <span m='116090'>is of interest to us.</span>
  </p><p><span m='117560'>And so we make this distinction</span> <span
  m='119620'>in the sample space.</span> </p><p><span m='121010'>So we keep the
  (3, 2) and the (2, 3) as separate outcomes.</span> </p><p><span m='128940'>Now
  this is a case of a model in which the probabilistic</span> <span
  m='132450'>experiment can be described in phases or stages.</span>
  </p><p><span m='137170'>We could think about rolling the die once and then
  going</span> <span m='142240'>ahead with the second roll.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143820'>So we have two stages.</span> </p><p><span m='145720'>A very useful
  way of describing the sample space of</span> <span
  m='148890'>experiments--</span> <span m='149950'>whenever we have an
  experiment with several stages, either</span> <span m='155390'>real stages or
  imagined stages.</span> </p><p><span m='157780'>So a very useful way of
  describing it is by providing</span> <span m='160980'>a sequential description
  in terms of a tree.</span> </p><p><span m='165070'>So a diagram of this kind,
  we call it a tree.</span> </p><p><span m='169240'>You can think of this as the
  root of the tree</span> <span m='171770'>from which you start.</span>
  </p><p><span m='173290'>And the endpoints of the tree, we usually</span> <span
  m='176770'>call them the leaves.</span> </p><p><span m='178780'>So the
  experiment starts.</span> </p><p><span m='180560'>We carry out the first
  phase, which in this case is the</span> <span m='183510'>first roll.</span>
  </p><p><span m='184620'>And we see what happens.</span> </p><p><span
  m='185910'>So maybe we get a 2 in the first roll.</span> </p><p><span
  m='189570'>And then we take note of what happened in the second roll.</span>
  </p><p><span m='193880'>And maybe the result was a 3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='196840'>So we follow this branch here.</span> </p><p><span m='198720'>And
  we end up at this particular leaf, which is the</span> <span m='202610'>leaf
  associated with the outcome 2, 3.</span> </p><p><span m='206030'>Notice that
  in this tree we once more have a distinction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='209760'>The outcome 2 followed by a 3 is different from the outcome</span>
  <span m='213740'>3 followed by a 2, which would correspond to this
  particular</span> <span m='218190'>place in the diagram.</span> </p><p><span
  m='220890'>In both cases, we have 16 possible outcomes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='224510'>4 times 4 makes 16.</span> </p><p><span m='226360'>And similarly,
  if you count here, the number of leaves is</span> <span m='229520'>equal to
  16.</span> </p><p><span m='232230'>The previous example involves a sample
  space that was</span> <span m='235670'>discrete and finite.</span>
  </p><p><span m='237510'>There were only 16 possible outcomes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='240440'>But sample spaces can also be infinite.</span>
  </p><p><span m='243650'>And they could also be continuous sets.</span>
  </p><p><span m='246440'>Here's an example of an experiment that involves
  a</span> <span m='249530'>continuous sample space.</span> </p><p><span
  m='251640'>So we have a rectangular target</span> <span m='254130'>which is
  the unit square.</span> </p><p><span m='257040'>And you throw a dart on that
  target.</span> </p><p><span m='260339'>And suppose that you are so skilled
  that no matter what,</span> <span m='265200'>when you throw the dart, it
  always</span> <span m='267630'>falls inside the target.</span> </p><p><span
  m='271340'>Once the dart hits the target, you record the coordinates x</span>
  <span m='277970'>and y of the particular point that resulted</span> <span
  m='281930'>from your dart throw.</span> </p><p><span m='283530'>And we record
  x and y with infinite precision.</span> </p><p><span m='288380'>So x and y are
  real numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='291120'>So in this experiment, the sample
  space is just the set</span> <span m='295020'>of x, y pairs that lie between 0
  and 1.</span> </p><p></p>
