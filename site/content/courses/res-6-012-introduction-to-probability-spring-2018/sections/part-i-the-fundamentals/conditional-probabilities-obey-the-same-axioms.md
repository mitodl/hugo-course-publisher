title: Conditional Probabilities Obey the Same Axioms
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="1500">I now want to emphasize an important
  point.</span></p><p><span m="4860">Conditional probabilities are just the same
  as ordinary</span> <span m="8200">probabilities applied to a different
  situation.</span></p><p><span m="12020">They do not taste or smell or behave
  any differently than</span> <span m="16700">ordinary
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="18680">What do I mean by
  that?</span></p><p><span m="20260">I mean that they satisfy the usual
  probability axioms.</span></p><p><span m="24770">For example, ordinary
  probabilities must also be</span> <span
  m="28830">non-negative.</span></p><p><span m="29560">Is this true for
  conditional probabilities?</span></p><p><span m="32420">Of course it is true,
  because conditional probabilities are</span> <span m="35250">defined as a
  ratio of two probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="38460">Probabilities are
  non-negative.</span></p><p><span m="40150">So the ratio will also be
  non-negative, of course as</span> <span m="43950">long as it is
  well-defined.</span></p><p><span m="45600">And here we need to remember that
  we only talk about</span> <span m="49460">conditional probabilities when we
  condition on an event that</span> <span m="53370">itself has positive
  probability.</span></p><p><span m="56590">How about another
  axiom?</span></p><p><span m="59170">What is the probability of the entire
  sample space,</span> <span m="63540">given the event B?</span></p><p><span
  m="65400">Let's check it out.</span></p><p><span m="66940">By definition, the
  conditional probability is the probability</span> <span m="71950">of the
  intersection of the two events involved divided by the</span> <span
  m="77200">probability of the conditioning event.</span></p><p><span
  m="81380">Now, what is the intersection of omega with B?</span></p><p><span
  m="84545">B is a subset of omega.</span></p><p><span m="86400">So when we
  intersect the two sets, we're</span> <span m="89880">left just with B
  itself.</span></p><p><span m="92740">So the numerator becomes the probability
  of B. We're</span> <span m="96810">dividing by the probability of B, and so
  the</span> <span m="99570">answer is equal to 1.</span></p><p><span
  m="101330">So indeed, the sample space has unit probability, even</span> <span
  m="106610">under the conditional model.</span></p><p><span m="109229">Now,
  remember that when we condition on an event B, we</span> <span
  m="113390">could still work with the original sample space.</span></p><p><span
  m="116320">However, possible outcomes that do not belong to B are</span> <span
  m="120230">considered impossible, so we might as well think of B</span> <span
  m="124140">itself as being our sample space.</span></p><p><span m="127170">If
  we proceed like that and think now of B as being our</span> <span
  m="130949">new sample space, what is the probability of this new sample</span>
  <span m="135980">space in the conditional model?</span></p><p><span
  m="138180">Let's apply the definition once more.</span></p><p><span
  m="140960">It's the probability of the intersection of the two events</span>
  <span m="145490">involved, B intersection B, divided by the probability
  of</span> <span m="150450">the conditioning event.</span></p><p><span
  m="152980">What is the numerator?</span></p><p><span m="154360">The
  intersection of B with itself is just B, so the</span> <span
  m="158490">numerator is the probability of B. We're dividing by the</span>
  <span m="162290">probability of B. So the answer is, again,
  1.</span></p><p><span m="167370">Finally, we need to check the additivity
  axiom.</span></p><p><span m="172130">Recall what the additivity axiom
  says.</span></p><p><span m="175210">If we have two events, two subsets of the
  sample space</span> <span m="179070">that are disjoint, then the probability
  of their union is</span> <span m="183140">equal to the sum of their individual
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="187250">Is this going to be the case if
  we now condition on a</span> <span m="190950">certain
  event?</span></p><p><span m="193290">What we want to prove is the following
  statement.</span></p><p><span m="197430">If we take two events that are
  disjoint, they have empty</span> <span m="201870">intersection, then the
  probability of the union is</span> <span m="206210">the sum of their
  individual probabilities, but where now</span> <span m="210680">the
  probabilities that we're employing are the conditional</span> <span
  m="213420">probabilities, given the event B. So let us verify whether</span>
  <span m="218329">this relation, this fact is correct or
  not.</span></p><p><span m="223579">Let us take this quantity and use
  the</span> <span m="226590">definition to write it out.</span></p><p><span
  m="229510">By definition, this conditional probability is the</span> <span
  m="232630">probability of the intersection of the first</span> <span
  m="236730">event of interest, the one that appears on this side of</span>
  <span m="241040">the conditioning, intersection with the event on which we
  are</span> <span m="245420">conditioning.</span></p><p><span m="247580">And
  then we divide by the probability of the</span> <span m="251080">conditioning
  event, B. Now, let's look at this quantity,</span> <span m="255980">what is
  it?</span></p><p><span m="256820">We're taking the union of A with C, and then
  intersect it</span> <span m="260990">with B. This union consists of these two
  pieces.</span></p><p><span m="266930">When we intersect with B, what is left
  is</span> <span m="270130">these two pieces here.</span></p><p><span
  m="274940">So A union C intersected with B is the union of two
  pieces.</span></p><p><span m="282770">One piece is A intersection B, this
  piece here.</span></p><p><span m="288870">And another piece, which is C
  intersection B, this is the</span> <span m="295510">second piece
  here.</span></p><p><span m="296980">So here we basically used a set theoretic
  identity.</span></p><p><span m="302200">And now we divide by the same
  [denominator]</span> <span m="305640">as before.</span></p><p><span
  m="307780">And now let us continue.</span></p><p><span m="310330">Here's an
  interesting observation.</span></p><p><span m="314460">The events A and C are
  disjoint.</span></p><p><span m="318180">The piece of A that also belongs in B,
  therefore, is</span> <span m="322870">disjoint from the piece of C that also
  belongs to B.</span></p><p><span m="327920">Therefore, this set here and that
  set here are disjoint.</span></p><p><span m="335400">Since they are disjoint,
  the probability of their union has</span> <span m="339530">to be equal to the
  sum of their individual</span> <span
  m="342850">probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="345070">So here we're using
  the additivity axiom on the</span> <span m="349040">original probabilities to
  break this probability up into</span> <span m="354260">two
  pieces.</span></p><p><span m="359770">And now we observe that here we have the
  ratio of an</span> <span m="365870">intersection by the probability of B. This
  is just</span> <span m="369560">the conditional probability of A given B using
  the definition</span> <span m="374270">of conditional
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="376860">And the second part is the
  conditional probability of C</span> <span m="381750">given B, where, again,
  we're using the definition of</span> <span m="385240">conditional
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="387370">So we have indeed checked that
  this additivity property is</span> <span m="392490">true for the case of
  conditional probabilities when</span> <span m="397450">we consider two
  disjoint events.</span></p><p><span m="400530">Now, we could repeat the same
  derivation and verify that it</span> <span m="405340">is also true for the
  case of a disjoint union, of finitely</span> <span m="412810">many events, or
  even for countably</span> <span m="417260">many disjoint
  events.</span></p><p><span m="420120">So we do have finite and countable
  additivity.</span></p><p><span m="425720">We're not proving it, but the
  argument is exactly the same</span> <span m="430240">as for the case of two
  events.</span></p><p><span m="433010">So conditional probabilities do satisfy
  all of the standard</span> <span m="438510">axioms of probability
  theory.</span></p><p><span m="440840">So conditional probabilities are just
  like ordinary</span> <span m="443700">probabilities.</span></p><p><span
  m="444970">This actually has a very important implication.</span></p><p><span
  m="448460">Since conditional probabilities satisfy all of</span> <span
  m="450800">the probability axioms, any formula or theorem that we</span> <span
  m="454710">ever derive for ordinary probabilities will remain true</span>
  <span m="459880">for conditional probabilities as
  well.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
