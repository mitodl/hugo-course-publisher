title: Independence Versus Conditional Independence
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="2029">We have already seen an example in which we</span> <span
  m="5230">have two events that are independent</span> <span m="8350">but become
  dependent in a conditional model.</span></p><p><span m="12810">So that
  [independence] and conditional independence</span> <span m="15850">is not the
  same.</span></p><p><span m="18150">We will now see another example in which a
  similar situation is</span> <span m="23250">obtained.</span></p><p><span
  m="24130">The example is as follows.</span></p><p><span m="26600">We have two
  possible coins, coin A and coin B.</span></p><p><span m="31470">This is the
  model of the world given</span> <span m="35240">that coin A has been
  chosen.</span></p><p><span m="37740">So this is a conditional model
  given</span> <span m="39800">that we have in our hands coin
  A.</span></p><p><span m="42010">In this conditional model, the probability of
  heads is 0.9.</span></p><p><span m="46210">And, moreover, the probability of
  heads</span> <span m="49900">is 0.9 in the second toss no matter</span> <span
  m="52670">what happened in the first toss and so on as we
  continue.</span></p><p><span m="57240">So given a particular coin, we
  assume</span> <span m="62930">that we have independent
  tosses.</span></p><p><span m="70750">This is another way of saying that
  we're</span> <span m="73860">assuming conditional
  independence.</span></p><p><span m="76310">Within this conditional model, coin
  flips are independent.</span></p><p><span m="80580">And the same assumption is
  made in</span> <span m="82670">the other possible conditional
  universe.</span></p><p><span m="85740">This is a universe in which we're
  dealing with coin B.</span></p><p><span m="89140">Once more, we have,
  conditionally</span> <span m="92000">independent tosses.</span></p><p><span
  m="93650">And this time, the probability of heads at each toss is
  0.1.</span></p><p><span m="97900">Suppose now that we choose one of the two
  coins.</span></p><p><span m="101680">Each coin is chosen with the same
  probability, 0.5.</span></p><p><span m="105509">So we're equally likely to
  obtain this coin--</span> <span m="108259">and then start flipping it over and
  over--</span> <span m="110539">or that coin-- and start flipping it over and
  over.</span></p><p><span m="114850">The question we will try to answer</span>
  <span m="117170">is whether the coin tosses are
  independent.</span></p><p><span m="123560">And by this, we mean a question
  that</span> <span m="127740">refers to the overall model.</span></p><p><span
  m="131950">In this general model, are the different coin tosses</span> <span
  m="135330">independent?</span></p><p><span m="136290">Where you do not know
  ahead of time which coin is going to be.</span></p><p><span m="140680">We can
  approach this question by trying</span> <span m="142700">to compare
  conditional and unconditional probabilities.</span></p><p><span
  m="147160">That's what independence is about.</span></p><p><span
  m="148930">Independence is about certain conditional probabilities</span>
  <span m="153090">being the same as the unconditional
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="156660">So this here, this comparison
  here</span> <span m="159140">is essentially the question of whether the 11th
  coin</span> <span m="163610">toss is dependent or independent from what</span>
  <span m="168720">happened in the first 10 coin tosses.</span></p><p><span
  m="171880">Let us calculate these probabilities.</span></p><p><span
  m="174390">For this one, we use the total probability
  theorem.</span></p><p><span m="179490">There's a certain probability that we
  have coin A,</span> <span m="184320">and then we have the probability of heads
  in the 11th toss given</span> <span m="188700">that it was coin A. There's
  also a certain probablility</span> <span m="192290">that it's coin B and then
  a conditional probability</span> <span m="196670">that we obtain heads given
  that it was coin B.</span></p><p><span m="201030">We use the numbers that are
  given in this example.</span></p><p><span m="204090">We have 0.5 probability
  of obtaining a particular coin,</span> <span m="209470">0.9 probability of
  heads for coin A, 0.5 probability</span> <span m="214440">that it's coin B,
  and 0.1 probability of heads</span> <span m="218020">if it is indeed coin
  B.</span></p><p><span m="219706">We do the arithmetic, and we find</span>
  <span m="221820">that the answer is 0.5, which makes perfect
  sense.</span></p><p><span m="225780">We have coins with different
  biases,</span> <span m="228440">but the average bias is
  0.5.</span></p><p><span m="231130">If we do not know which coin it's going to
  be,</span> <span m="234020">the average bias is going to be
  0.5.</span></p><p><span m="236690">So the probability of heads in any
  particular toss</span> <span m="239570">is 0.5 if we do not know which coin it
  is.</span></p><p><span m="244580">Suppose now that someone told you</span>
  <span m="246180">that the first 10 tosses were heads.</span></p><p><span
  m="249170">Will this affect your beliefs about what's</span> <span
  m="252090">going to happen in the 11th toss?</span></p><p><span m="255370">We
  can calculate this quantity using</span> <span m="258010">the definition of
  conditional probabilities,</span> <span m="260019">or the Bayes' rule, but let
  us instead think intuitively.</span></p><p><span m="265280">If it is coin B,
  the events of 10 heads in a row</span> <span m="271220">is extremely
  unlikely.</span></p><p><span m="273530">So if I see 10 heads in a row,
  then</span> <span m="277250">I should conclude that there is almost certainty
  that I'm</span> <span m="284120">dealing with coin A.</span></p><p><span
  m="286350">So the information that I'm given</span> <span m="288760">tells me
  that I'm extremely likely to be dealing with coin</span> <span m="292860">A.
  So we might as well condition on this equivalent information</span> <span
  m="298690">that it is coin A that I'm dealing with.</span></p><p><span
  m="301180">But if it is coin A, then the probability of heads</span> <span
  m="304160">is going to be equal to 0.9.</span></p><p><span m="306710">So the
  conditional probability is</span> <span m="308550">quite different from the
  unconditional probability.</span></p><p><span m="312450">And therefore,
  information on the first 10 tosses</span> <span m="316430">affects my beliefs
  about what's going</span> <span m="318570">to happen in the [11th]
  toss.</span></p><p><span m="320990">And therefore, we do not have
  independence</span> <span m="324530">between the different
  tosses.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
