title: Interpreting the Correlation Coefficient
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='60'>The mathematics of the correlation</span> <span
  m='1740'>coefficient are important.</span> </p><p><span m='3810'>But it is
  perhaps more important to be able to</span> <span m='6410'>interpret it
  correctly.</span> </p><p><span m='8370'>A correlation coefficient of let's say
  0.5, tells us that</span> <span m='12400'>something interesting is going on as
  far as the relation of X</span> <span m='15790'>and Y is concerned.</span>
  </p><p><span m='17910'>But what exactly?</span> </p><p><span m='19300'>It
  tells us that the two random variables are</span> <span m='21570'>associated
  in some sense.</span> </p><p><span m='23770'>But this is often misinterpreted
  to mean that</span> <span m='26740'>there is a causal relation between the
  two.</span> </p><p><span m='29950'>But this is wrong.</span> </p><p><span
  m='32155'>A large correlation coefficient in general does</span> <span
  m='35950'>not indicate that there is a causal relation between the</span>
  <span m='39580'>random variables.</span> </p><p><span m='41450'>As an example,
  suppose that X somehow quantifies the</span> <span m='45220'>mathematical
  aptitude of a person.</span> </p><p><span m='47310'>And Y somehow quantifies
  the musical ability of a person.</span> </p><p><span m='52290'>In general, it
  has been found that mathematical aptitude and</span> <span m='55450'>musical
  ability are correlated.</span> </p><p><span m='57780'>People who score high on
  one will score high on</span> <span m='60800'>the other as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='62420'>Is there a causal relation?</span> </p><p><span
  m='64720'>If you study math a lot and you become very good at math,</span>
  <span m='69789'>does it mean that you would become a better musician?</span>
  </p><p><span m='72890'>Not necessarily.</span> </p><p><span m='74140'>Or if
  you practice the violin day in and day out, does it</span> <span
  m='78210'>mean that you will score better in the math exam?</span>
  </p><p><span m='81510'>Again, not necessarily.</span> </p><p><span
  m='83360'>Perhaps what is going on is that there's a certain feature</span>
  <span m='86760'>of the human brain and when that feature is well</span> <span
  m='89630'>developed, then that feature helps both in math and in</span> <span
  m='95289'>musical ability.</span> </p><p><span m='96750'>And this is a typical
  situation of how a correlation</span> <span m='99920'>coefficient may
  arise.</span> </p><p><span m='101940'>That is often a correlation coefficient
  that's</span> <span m='104340'>significant, reflects that there is an
  underlying common</span> <span m='108570'>but perhaps hidden factor that
  affects both of the random</span> <span m='112810'>variables X and Y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114710'>Let's us go through a simple numerical example that
  models</span> <span m='118640'>a situation of this kind.</span> </p><p><span
  m='120980'>Suppose that Z, V, and w are independent random variables.</span>
  </p><p><span m='124440'>And that we have two more random variables defined
  by</span> <span m='127120'>these relations.</span> </p><p><span m='128490'>Not
  that there's no direct influence from X to Y or from</span> <span m='133110'>Y
  to X.</span> </p><p><span m='134520'>But on the other hand, there's a common
  underlying factor,</span> <span m='136990'>this random variable Z that affects
  both X and Y. Because</span> <span m='140880'>of this, we expect that X and Y
  will somehow have some kind</span> <span m='145270'>of relation or association
  between them.</span> </p><p><span m='148000'>And we would like to measure the
  strength of that</span> <span m='150210'>association.</span> </p><p><span
  m='151460'>The way to measure it will be in terms of the correlation</span>
  <span m='154329'>coefficient, which we will now proceed to compute.</span>
  </p><p><span m='157800'>To have a complete example in our hands and in order
  to also</span> <span m='161890'>keep things simple, let's us assume that the
  basic</span> <span m='164630'>underlying random variable Z, V, and W all have
  0 means and</span> <span m='168540'>unit variances.</span> </p><p><span
  m='170240'>And now let us take the definition of the correlation</span> <span
  m='172880'>coefficient and start calculating.</span> </p><p><span
  m='176090'>Let us look at the variance of X. Because X is the sum of
  two</span> <span m='181600'>independent random variables, its variance is
  going to be</span> <span m='185300'>the sum of those variances.</span>
  </p><p><span m='188290'>And we have assumed that each one of those variances
  is</span> <span m='191370'>equal to 1.</span> </p><p><span m='192100'>So the
  variance of X is equal to 2.</span> </p><p><span m='195050'>And that implies
  that the standard deviation of X is</span> <span m='198000'>equal to the
  square root of 2.</span> </p><p><span m='200270'>By a similar argument, the
  standard deviation of Y is</span> <span m='203650'>also equal to the square
  root of 2.</span> </p><p><span m='206440'>Now, let us look at the covariance
  between X and Y.</span> </p><p><span m='211350'>Because X and Y have 0 means,
  the covariance is just the</span> <span m='216660'>expected value of the
  product of the two random variables.</span> </p><p><span m='220160'>And using
  the definition of what these two random</span> <span m='222990'>variables are,
  it's this particular product here.</span> </p><p><span m='227450'>We expand
  the product into a sum of four terms.</span> </p><p><span m='231040'>And take
  the expected value of each one of the four terms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='244170'>Which leaves us with this particular expression here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='251580'>Now, Z has 0 mean and unit variance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='255240'>Therefore, the expected value of Z squared is equal to
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='258940'>How about the next term?</span> </p><p><span
  m='260680'>V and Z are independent.</span> </p><p><span m='262240'>So the
  expected value of the product is the product of the</span> <span
  m='265140'>expected values.</span> </p><p><span m='266210'>But the expected
  values are zero, so this term is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='270410'>And with
  a similar argument, the other</span> <span m='272500'>terms are zero as
  well.</span> </p><p><span m='275150'>So the co-variance is equal to 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='277970'>And from this, we can conclude our calculation and
  write that</span> <span m='283350'>the correlation coefficient between X and Y
  is equal to 1</span> <span m='288340'>divided by the square root of 2 times
  square root of 2,</span> <span m='293270'>which is 1/2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='296940'>This example also serves to give you a rough idea of what</span>
  <span m='300610'>it may mean to have a correlation</span> <span
  m='302790'>coefficient of 1/2.</span> </p><p><span m='305320'>It means that
  the two random variables</span> <span m='307510'>have some common
  elements.</span> </p><p><span m='310310'>And they also have some idiosyncratic
  elements.</span> </p><p><span m='313690'>And these two elements are roughly
  equal in weight.</span> </p><p><span m='318390'>If V and W were completely
  absent, the correlation</span> <span m='322220'>coefficient would have been
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='324405'>If on the other hand V and W had a huge
  variance, so as to</span> <span m='329900'>completely hide the effect of Z,
  then the value of the</span> <span m='333810'>correlation coefficient would
  have been much, much smaller</span> <span m='337490'>perhaps closer to
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='339480'>And in the extreme case of course where Z is
  completely</span> <span m='342260'>absent, then X and Y are independent, and
  we get a</span> <span m='345610'>correlation coefficient of 0.</span>
