title: Lecture Overview
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="270">Suppose I look at the registry of residents of my town
  and</span> <span m="3740">pick a person at random.</span></p><p><span
  m="5950">What is the probability that this person is</span> <span
  m="7860">under 18 years of age?</span></p><p><span m="10260">The answer is
  about 25%.</span></p><p><span m="13620">Suppose now that I tell you that this
  person is married.</span></p><p><span m="16880">Will you give the same
  answer?</span></p><p><span m="18990">Of course not.</span></p><p><span
  m="20220">The probability of being less than 18 years</span> <span
  m="23040">old is now much smaller.</span></p><p><span m="26120">What happened
  here?</span></p><p><span m="27830">We started with some initial probabilities
  that reflect</span> <span m="30680">what we know or believe about the
  world.</span></p><p><span m="33780">But we then acquired some
  additional</span> <span m="36320">knowledge, some new evidence--</span> <span
  m="38140">for example, about this person's family
  situation.</span></p><p><span m="42160">This new knowledge should cause our
  beliefs to change,</span> <span m="45030">and the original probabilities must
  be replaced with new</span> <span m="48430">probabilities that take into
  account the new information.</span></p><p><span m="53320">These revised
  probabilities are what we call conditional</span> <span
  m="56430">probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="57660">And this is the subject
  of this lecture.</span></p><p><span m="61060">We will start with a formal
  definition of conditional</span> <span m="64420">probabilities together with
  the motivation behind this</span> <span m="68289">particular
  definition.</span></p><p><span m="70050">We will then proceed to develop three
  tools that rely</span> <span m="73515">on conditional probabilities, including
  the Bayes rule,</span> <span m="77410">which provides a systematic way for
  incorporating new</span> <span m="80900">evidence into a probability
  model.</span></p><p><span m="84050">The three tools that we introduce in this
  lecture</span> <span m="86450">involve very simple and elementary
  mathematical</span> <span m="90250">formulas, yet they encapsulate some very
  powerful ideas.</span></p><p><span m="95270">It is not an exaggeration to say
  that much of this class</span> <span m="99140">will revolve around the
  repeated application of</span> <span m="102539">variations of these three
  tools to increasingly</span> <span m="105690">complicated
  situations.</span></p><p><span m="107759">In particular, the Bayes rule is the
  foundation for the</span> <span m="111080">field of
  inference.</span></p><p><span m="112560">It is a guide on how to process data
  and make</span> <span m="116039">inferences about unobserved quantities or
  phenomena.</span></p><p><span m="119950">As such, it is a tool that is used
  all the time, all over</span> <span m="124580">science and
  engineering.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
