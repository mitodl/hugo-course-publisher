title: The Conditional Variance
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='390'>We have defined the conditional expectation of a</span> <span
  m='3020'>random variable given another as an abstract object, which</span>
  <span m='6590'>is itself a random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='9370'>Let
  us now do something analogous with the notion of</span> <span
  m='12320'>[the]</span> <span m='12400'>conditional variance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='14030'>Let us start with the definition of the
  variance,</span> <span m='16860'>which is the following.</span> </p><p><span
  m='18810'>We look at the deviation of the random variable from its</span>
  <span m='21940'>mean, square it, then take the average of that
  quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='26060'>If we live in a conditional universe
  where we are told the</span> <span m='29580'>value of some other random
  variable, capital Y, then</span> <span m='33270'>inside that conditional
  universe the variance becomes</span> <span m='37000'>the following.</span>
  </p><p><span m='38240'>It is defined the same way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='40700'>Well, in the conditional universe, this is the expected</span> <span
  m='43670'>value of X.</span> </p><p><span m='44890'>So this quantity here is
  the deviation of X from its</span> <span m='49410'>expected value in that
  conditional universe.</span> </p><p><span m='52530'>We square this quantity,
  we find the squared deviation,</span> <span m='56390'>and we look at the
  expected value of</span> <span m='58380'>that squared deviation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='59690'>But because we live in a conditional universe,
  of</span> <span m='62770'>course, this expectation has to be a conditional one
  given</span> <span m='66280'>the information that we have available.</span>
  </p><p><span m='69010'>So this is nothing but the ordinary variance, but
  it's</span> <span m='73539'>the variance of the conditional distribution
  of</span> <span m='76000'>the random variable, capital X. This is an</span>
  <span m='79320'>equality between numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='81460'>If I
  tell you the value of little y, the conditional</span> <span
  m='85450'>variance is defined by this particular</span> <span
  m='89430'>quantity, which is a number.</span> </p><p><span m='92970'>Now, we
  proceed in the same way as we proceeded for the</span> <span m='96660'>case
  where we defined the conditional expectation as a</span> <span
  m='99550'>random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='100960'>Namely, we think of
  this quantity as a function of</span> <span m='105910'>little y, and that
  function can be now used to define a</span> <span m='111280'>random
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='113420'>And that random variable, which would
  denote this way,</span> <span m='118000'>this is the random variable which
  takes this specific</span> <span m='123240'>value when capital Y happens to be
  equal to little y.</span> </p><p><span m='128740'>Once we know the value of
  capital Y, then this quantity</span> <span m='133820'>takes a specific
  value.</span> </p><p><span m='135780'>But before we know the value of capital
  Y, then this</span> <span m='139610'>quantity is not known.</span>
  </p><p><span m='140980'>It's random.</span> </p><p><span m='141560'>It's a
  random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='144960'>Let us look at an example to
  make this more concrete.</span> </p><p><span m='148060'>Suppose that Y is a
  random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='150970'>We draw that random
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='152329'>And we're told that conditioned on
  the value of</span> <span m='155079'>that random variable, X is going to be
  uniform on this</span> <span m='158990'>particular interval from 0 to
  Y.</span> </p><p><span m='161890'>So if I tell you that capital Y takes on a
  specific</span> <span m='165840'>numerical value, then the random variable X
  is uniform</span> <span m='170710'>on the interval from 0 to little y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='174565'>A random variable that's uniform on an interval
  of</span> <span m='177710'>length little y has a variance that we know what it
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='181910'>It's y squared over 12.</span> </p><p><span
  m='185260'>So this is an equality between numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='187280'>For any specific value of little y, this is the</span> <span
  m='190350'>numerical value of the conditional variance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='193640'>Let us now change this equality between numbers into</span> <span
  m='196590'>an abstract equality between random variables.</span> </p><p><span
  m='199840'>The random variable, variance of X given Y, is a random</span>
  <span m='204230'>variable that takes this value whenever</span> <span
  m='206920'>capital Y is little y.</span> </p><p><span m='208950'>But that's
  the same as this random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='213510'>This is a
  random variable that takes this value whenever</span> <span m='217430'>capital
  Y happens to be equal to little y.</span> </p><p><span m='222020'>So we have
  defined the abstract concept of a</span> <span m='225640'>conditional
  variance, similar to the case of conditional</span> <span
  m='228140'>expectations.</span> </p><p><span m='229300'>For conditional
  expectations, we had the law of iterated</span> <span
  m='232270'>expectations.</span> </p><p><span m='233400'>That tells us that the
  expected value of the</span> <span m='236030'>conditional expectation is the
  unconditional expectation.</span> </p><p><span m='239450'>Is it true that the
  expected value of the conditional</span> <span m='242520'>variance is going to
  be the same as the</span> <span m='244560'>unconditional variance?</span>
  </p><p><span m='246580'>Unfortunately, no.</span> </p><p><span
  m='248290'>Things are a little more complicated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='250390'>The unconditional variance is equal to the expected value of</span>
  <span m='253900'>the conditional variance, but there is an extra term,
  that</span> <span m='258079'>is, the variance of the conditional
  expectation.</span> </p><p><span m='262920'>The entries here in red are all
  random variables.</span> </p><p><span m='266570'>So the conditional variance
  has been defined as a random</span> <span m='269320'>variable, so it has an
  expectation of its own.</span> </p><p><span m='272080'>The conditional
  expectation, as we have already discussed,</span> <span m='274850'>is also a
  random variable, so it has a variance of its own.</span> </p><p><span
  m='278700'>And by adding those terms, we get the total variance of the</span>
  <span m='282030'>random variable X.</span> </p><p><span m='284110'>So what we
  will do next will be first to prove this</span> <span m='289010'>equality, and
  then give a number of examples that are</span> <span m='292750'>going to give
  us some intuition about what these</span> <span m='296040'>terms mean and why
  this equality makes sense.</span> </p><p></p>
