  <p><span m='500'>This is an example, or rather, a story,</span> <span
  m='3350'>that's supposed to give us some insight</span> <span m='5360'>and
  some intuition about what the law</span> <span m='7400'>of iterated
  expectations really means.</span> </p><p><span m='10320'>Suppose that you work
  for a forecasting company.</span> </p><p><span m='13870'>And suppose that you
  make forecasts</span> <span m='16329'>by calculating expected values of the
  quantities</span> <span m='19070'>that you want to forecast.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20430'>And of course, when you calculate an expected
  value,</span> <span m='22650'>you always use whatever information you
  have.</span> </p><p><span m='25880'>So here we have the beginning of the
  year.</span> </p><p><span m='30070'>And you're working for a company
  that's</span> <span m='32910'>trying to forecast the sales during the month of
  February.</span> </p><p><span m='38160'>That's a random variable,
  capital</span> <span m='40450'>X. You're sitting in your office in the
  beginning of the year.</span> </p><p><span m='45160'>What is going to be your
  forecast?</span> </p><p><span m='47210'>It's going to be the expected value of
  the random variable X.</span> </p><p><span m='51550'>So this is a forecast
  that you make at this point in time.</span> </p><p><span m='56220'>Now, time
  goes by, and we're sitting now</span> <span m='59050'>in the beginning of
  February or the end of January.</span> </p><p><span m='62590'>At that time,
  you obtain some new information,</span> <span m='66270'>which is the value,
  little y, of a random variable, capital</span> <span m='72380'>Y. What should
  your new forecast be?</span> </p><p><span m='78270'>Well, once you have this
  information in your hands,</span> <span m='81500'>your new forecast should be
  the expected value</span> <span m='84140'>of x, given the specific available
  information</span> <span m='88150'>that you have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='89440'>So this is the revised forecast as</span> <span m='91840'>calculated
  at the end of January.</span> </p><p><span m='95600'>But if you're sitting
  here in the beginning of the year</span> <span m='99220'>and you ask yourself,
  what is the revised forecast going</span> <span m='103229'>to be, your answer
  would be, I don't</span> <span m='106220'>know what it's going to be.</span>
  </p><p><span m='107670'>It's random.</span> </p><p><span m='108660'>It depends
  on what capital Y would end up being.</span> </p><p><span m='112880'>My
  revised forecast is a random variable, the expected value</span> <span
  m='119340'>of X given Y, which will take this particular numerical
  value</span> <span m='124220'>if it turns out the random variable Y</span>
  <span m='127180'>takes a specific value, little y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='129880'>So this is the forecast calculated</span> <span m='132020'>at this
  point in time.</span> </p><p><span m='133600'>This is the forecast viewed at
  the beginning</span> <span m='136630'>of the year, at which time we do not
  know yet</span> <span m='140050'>the value of the revised forecast.</span>
  </p><p><span m='144130'>Now, what does the law of iterated expectations</span>
  <span m='147250'>tell us in this case?</span> </p><p><span m='148780'>It tells
  us that the expected value of the revised forecast</span> <span m='152860'>is
  the same as the original forecast.</span> </p><p><span m='169970'>What does
  this mean in practical terms?</span> </p><p><span m='177650'>It means that
  given today's forecast,</span> <span m='181810'>the original forecast, you do
  not</span> <span m='184160'>expect the next forecast, the revised</span> <span
  m='187180'>one, to be higher or lower.</span> </p><p><span m='190110'>It could
  be either higher or lower.</span> </p><p><span m='192930'>But on the average,
  you expect the revision</span> <span m='196570'>of the forecast going from
  this one to that one,</span> <span m='199710'>the revised one, that revision
  on the average,</span> <span m='202680'>to be equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='204490'>You do not expect forecasts to be revised either upwards</span>
  <span m='208540'>or downwards on the average.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211970'>Of course, this is not what happens always in real life.</span>
  </p><p><span m='215980'>So suppose that capital X, the quantity you're
  forecasting,</span> <span m='219430'>is the cost of some big project.</span>
  </p><p><span m='222600'>And your original budget or original forecast,</span>
  <span m='226430'>expected value of X, is what you expect</span> <span
  m='229090'>the cost of the project to be.</span> </p><p><span m='231300'>Well,
  from experience with real life,</span> <span m='233430'>we kind of know that
  budgets or cost estimates</span> <span m='237100'>tend to be revised upwards
  more often than downwards.</span> </p><p><span m='241790'>Does this real life
  fact contradict</span> <span m='244610'>the law of iterated
  expectations?</span> </p><p><span m='247130'>Well, not really.</span>
  </p><p><span m='248570'>What is going on here is that real life forecasts are
  not</span> <span m='253210'>really honestly calculated expected values.</span>
  </p><p><span m='257880'>But maybe they're calculated with some implicit or
  hidden</span> <span m='262650'>biases so that the forecasts that are
  given</span> <span m='265520'>are actually not the expected values.</span>
  </p><p><span m='268580'>So there's no contradiction between this mathematical
  fact</span> <span m='272070'>and possible life experiences.</span> </p><p></p>
