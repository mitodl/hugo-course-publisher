title: Independence of Event Complements
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="860">Let us now discuss an interesting fact about</span> <span
  m="2870">independence that should enhance our
  understanding.</span></p><p><span m="6360">Suppose that events A and B are
  independent.</span></p><p><span m="10810">Intuitively, if I tell you that A
  occurred, this does not</span> <span m="14620">change your beliefs as to the
  likelihood that B will occur.</span></p><p><span m="18810">But in that case,
  this should not change your beliefs as to</span> <span m="22955">the
  likelihood that B will not occur.</span></p><p><span m="26870">So A should be
  independent of B complement.</span></p><p><span m="30900">In other words, the
  occurrence of A tells you nothing about</span> <span m="35110">B, and
  therefore tells you nothing about</span> <span m="38140">B complement
  either.</span></p><p><span m="40370">This was an intuitive argument that if A
  and B are</span> <span m="43300">independent, then A and B complement are
  also</span> <span m="46590">independent.</span></p><p><span m="47990">But let
  us now verify this intuition</span> <span m="50210">through a formal
  proof.</span></p><p><span m="52180">The formal proof goes as
  follows.</span></p><p><span m="54320">We have the two events, A and B. And
  event A can be broken</span> <span m="62430">down into two
  pieces.</span></p><p><span m="64930">One piece is the intersection of A with
  B. So that's the</span> <span m="72400">first piece.</span></p><p><span
  m="74880">And the second piece is the part of A which is outside
  B.</span></p><p><span m="81470">And that piece is A intersection with
  the</span> <span m="85370">complement of B. So these are the two pieces that
  together</span> <span m="90800">comprise event A.</span></p><p><span
  m="93720">Now, these two pieces are disjoint from each
  other.</span></p><p><span m="97120">And therefore, by the additivity axiom,
  the</span> <span m="100610">probability of A is equal to the probability of
  A</span> <span m="106259">intersection B plus the probability of A
  intersection</span> <span m="111120">with B complement.</span></p><p><span
  m="114539">Using independence, the first term becomes probability of A</span>
  <span m="120060">times probability of B. And we leave the second term as
  is.</span></p><p><span m="127540">Now let us move this term to the other
  side.</span></p><p><span m="130478">And we obtain that the probability of A
  intersection</span> <span m="134190">with B complement is the probability of A
  minus the</span> <span m="139120">probability of A times the probability of B.
  We factor</span> <span m="143820">out the term probability of A, and we are
  left with 1 minus</span> <span m="148790">probability of B. And then we
  recognize that 1 minus the</span> <span m="155420">probability of B is the
  same as the probability of B</span> <span
  m="158750">complement.</span></p><p><span m="160200">So we proved that the
  probability of A and B</span> <span m="164920">complement occurring together
  is the product of their</span> <span m="168010">individual
  probabilities.</span></p><p><span m="169829">And that's exactly the definition
  of A being</span> <span m="173230">independent from B
  complement.</span></p><p><span m="175140">And this concludes the formal
  proof.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
