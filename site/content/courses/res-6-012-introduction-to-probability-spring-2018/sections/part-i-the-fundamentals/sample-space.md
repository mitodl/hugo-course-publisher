  <p><span m="3300">Putting together a probabilistic model--</span> <span
  m="5900">that is, a model of a random phenomenon or a random</span> <span
  m="9060">experiment--</span> <span m="10300">involves two
  steps.</span></p><p><span m="12360">First step, we describe the possible
  outcomes of the</span> <span m="16020">phenomenon or experiment of
  interest.</span></p><p><span m="18930">Second step, we describe our beliefs
  about the likelihood</span> <span m="22940">of the different possible outcomes
  by specifying a</span> <span m="25660">probability law.</span></p><p><span
  m="27570">Here, we start by just talking about the first step, namely,</span>
  <span m="31650">the description of the possible outcomes of the</span> <span
  m="33830">experiment.</span></p><p><span m="34950">So we carry out an
  experiment.</span></p><p><span m="36760">For example, we flip a
  coin.</span></p><p><span m="38540">Or maybe we flip five coins
  simultaneously.</span></p><p><span m="41400">Or maybe we roll a
  die.</span></p><p><span m="43740">Whatever that experiment is, it has a number
  of possible</span> <span m="48390">outcomes, and we start by making a list
  of</span> <span m="51970">the possible outcomes--</span> <span m="53830">or, a
  better word, instead of the word &quot;list&quot;, is to use the</span> <span
  m="57490">word &quot;set&quot;, which has a more formal mathematical
  meaning.</span></p><p><span m="61520">So we create a set that we
  usually</span> <span m="65400">denote by capital omega.</span></p><p><span
  m="69850">That set is called the sample space and is the set of all</span>
  <span m="74570">possible outcomes of our experiment.</span></p><p><span
  m="81289">The elements of that set should have certain</span> <span
  m="84750">properties.</span></p><p><span m="85980">Namely, the elements should
  be mutually exclusive and</span> <span m="89590">collectively
  exhaustive.</span></p><p><span m="91620">What does that
  mean?</span></p><p><span m="92860">Mutually exclusive means that, if at the
  end of the</span> <span m="96289">experiment, I tell you that this outcome
  happened, then it</span> <span m="101160">should not be possible that this
  outcome also happened.</span></p><p><span m="104970">At the end of the
  experiment, there can only be one of the</span> <span m="107759">outcomes that
  has happened.</span></p><p><span m="110200">Being collectively exhaustive
  means something else-- that,</span> <span m="113420">together, all of these
  elements of the set exhaust</span> <span m="117330">all the
  possibilities.</span></p><p><span m="119400">So no matter what, at the end,
  you will be able to point to</span> <span m="123400">one of the outcomes and
  say, that's the one that occurred.</span></p><p><span m="127860">To
  summarize--</span> <span m="129009">this set should be such that, at the end
  of the experiment,</span> <span m="132340">you should be always able to point
  to one, and exactly one,</span> <span m="137270">of the possible outcomes and
  say that this is the outcome</span> <span m="140660">that
  occurred.</span></p><p><span m="143700">Physically different outcomes should
  be distinguished in the</span> <span m="148870">sample space and correspond to
  distinct points.</span></p><p><span m="153530">But when we say physically
  different</span> <span m="155760">outcomes, what do we
  mean?</span></p><p><span m="157840">We really mean different in all relevant
  aspects but</span> <span m="161910">perhaps not different in irrelevant
  aspects.</span></p><p><span m="165880">Let's make more precise what I mean by
  that by looking at a</span> <span m="170180">very simple, and maybe silly,
  example,</span> <span m="173600">which is the following.</span></p><p><span
  m="174625">Suppose that you flip a coin and you see whether it</span> <span
  m="178360">resulted in heads or tails.</span></p><p><span m="181980">So you
  have a perfectly legitimate sample space for</span> <span m="185890">this
  experiment which consists of just two points--</span> <span m="189470">heads
  and tails.</span></p><p><span m="191200">Together these two outcomes exhaust
  all possibilities.</span></p><p><span m="196750">And the two outcomes are
  mutually exclusive.</span></p><p><span m="199380">So this is a very legitimate
  sample space for this</span> <span m="202200">experiment.</span></p><p><span
  m="203760">Now suppose that while you were flipping the coin, you</span> <span
  m="206620">also looked outside the window to check the
  weather.</span></p><p><span m="210110">And then you could say that my sample
  space is really, heads,</span> <span m="217140">and it's
  raining.</span></p><p><span m="220970">Another possible outcome is heads and
  no rain.</span></p><p><span m="228780">Another possible outcome is tails, and
  it's raining, and,</span> <span m="235640">finally, another possible outcome
  is tails and no rain.</span></p><p><span m="245490">This set, consisting of
  four elements, is also a perfectly</span> <span m="251560">legitimate sample
  space for the experiment</span> <span m="254315">of flipping a
  coin.</span></p><p><span m="256140">The elements of this sample space are
  mutually exclusive</span> <span m="259060">and collectively
  exhaustive.</span></p><p><span m="260390">Exactly one of these outcomes is
  going to be true, or will</span> <span m="264830">have materialized, at the
  end of the experiment.</span></p><p><span m="267640">So which sample space is
  the correct one?</span></p><p><span m="270440">This sample space, the second
  one, involves</span> <span m="272950">some irrelevant
  details.</span></p><p><span m="274970">So the preferred sample space for
  describing the flipping of</span> <span m="280090">a coin, the preferred
  sample space is the simpler one, the</span> <span m="284260">first one, which
  is sort of at the right granularity, given</span> <span m="288340">what we're
  interested in.</span></p><p><span m="290640">But ultimately, the question of
  which one is the right</span> <span m="294010">sample space depends on what
  kind of</span> <span m="296760">questions you want to
  answer.</span></p><p><span m="298840">For example, if you have a theory that
  the weather</span> <span m="302280">affects the behavior of coins, then, in
  order to play with</span> <span m="307020">that theory, or maybe check it out,
  and so on, then, in such</span> <span m="311960">a case, you might want to
  work with the second sample space.</span></p><p><span m="315810">This is a
  common feature in all of science.</span></p><p><span m="319070">Whenever you
  put together a model, you need to decide how</span> <span m="322670">detailed
  you want your model to be.</span></p><p><span m="325080">And the right level
  of detail is the one that captures those</span> <span m="328870">aspects that
  are relevant and of interest to you.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
