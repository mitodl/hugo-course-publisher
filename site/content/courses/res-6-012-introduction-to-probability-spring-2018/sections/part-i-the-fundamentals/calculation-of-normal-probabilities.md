title: Calculation of Normal Probabilities
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='1080'>We have claimed that normal random variables are very</span>
  <span m='3660'>important, and therefore we would like to be able to</span>
  <span m='6880'>calculate probabilities associated with them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='9280'>For example, given a normal random variable, what is
  the</span> <span m='11940'>probability that it takes a value less than
  5?</span> </p><p><span m='15200'>Unfortunately, there are no closed form
  expressions that</span> <span m='18470'>can help us with this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20210'>In particular, the CDF, the Cumulative
  Distribution</span> <span m='23040'>Function of normal random variables, is
  not given in</span> <span m='26030'>closed form.</span> </p><p><span
  m='27120'>But fortunately, we do have tables for the standard normal</span>
  <span m='30960'>random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='32820'>These tables,
  which take the form shown here, give us the</span> <span m='38270'>following
  information.</span> </p><p><span m='40200'>If we have a normal random
  variable, which is a standard</span> <span m='43930'>normal, they tell us the
  values of the cumulative</span> <span m='48150'>distribution function for
  different values of little y.</span> </p><p><span m='55240'>In terms of a
  picture, if this is the PDF of a standard</span> <span m='59870'>normal and I
  give you a value little y, I'm interested in</span> <span m='64840'>the
  corresponding value of the CDF, which is the</span> <span m='68250'>area under
  the curve.</span> </p><p><span m='70150'>Well, that value, the area under this
  curve, is exactly</span> <span m='73770'>what this table is giving to
  us.</span> </p><p><span m='76580'>And there's a shorthand notation for
  referring to the</span> <span m='79990'>CDF of the standard normal, which is
  just phi of y.</span> </p><p><span m='84510'>Let us see how we use this
  table.</span> </p><p><span m='87390'>Suppose we're interested in phi of
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='91140'>Which is the probability that our standard
  normal takes a</span> <span m='93900'>value less than or equal to 0?</span>
  </p><p><span m='96570'>Well, by symmetry since the PDF is symmetric around 0,
  we</span> <span m='100259'>know that this probability should be 0.5.</span>
  </p><p><span m='104180'>Let's see what the table tells us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='106990'>0 corresponds to this entry, which is indeed 0.5.</span>
  </p><p><span m='113690'>Let us look up the probability that our standard
  normal takes</span> <span m='117789'>a value less than, let's say,
  1.16.</span> </p><p><span m='121330'>How do we find this information?</span>
  </p><p><span m='123580'>1 is here.</span> </p><p><span m='126620'>And 1.1 is
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='131770'>1.1, and then we have a 6 in the next
  decimal place, which</span> <span m='137350'>leads us to this entry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='140590'>And so this value is 0.8770.</span> </p><p><span
  m='147660'>Similarly, we can calculate the probability that the</span> <span
  m='151200'>normal is less than 2.9.</span> </p><p><span m='155030'>How do we
  look up this information?</span> </p><p><span m='157010'>2.9 is here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='158860'>We do not have another decimal digit, so we're looking
  at</span> <span m='162520'>this column.</span> </p><p><span m='163640'>And we
  obtain this value, which is 0.9981.</span> </p><p><span m='170910'>And by
  looking at this number we can actually tell that a</span> <span
  m='174930'>standard normal random variable has extremely low</span> <span
  m='179810'>probability of being bigger than 2.9.</span> </p><p><span
  m='184400'>Now notice that the table specifies phi of y for y being</span>
  <span m='188850'>non-negative.</span> </p><p><span m='190190'>What if we wish
  to calculate the value, for example, of phi</span> <span m='195820'>of minus
  2?</span> </p><p><span m='198860'>In terms of a picture, this is a standard
  normal.</span> </p><p><span m='203980'>Here is minus 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='206870'>And we wish to calculate this probability.</span> </p><p><span
  m='209570'>There's nothing in the table that gives us this probability</span>
  <span m='212040'>directly, but we can argue as follows.</span> </p><p><span
  m='215150'>The normal PDF is symmetric.</span> </p><p><span m='217730'>So if
  we look at 2, then this probability here, which is phi</span> <span
  m='223530'>of minus 2, is the same as that probability</span> <span
  m='227200'>here, of that tail.</span> </p><p><span m='229020'>What is the
  probability of that tail?</span> </p><p><span m='231810'>It's 1, which is the
  overall area under the curve, minus</span> <span m='236750'>the area under the
  curve when you go up to the value of 2.</span> </p><p><span m='244540'>So this
  quantity is going to be the same as phi of minus 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='251340'>And this one we can now get from the tables.</span> </p><p><span
  m='254570'>It's 1 minus--</span> <span m='255830'>let us see, 2 is
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='258709'>It's 1 minus 0.9772.</span> </p><p><span
  m='267170'>The standard normal table gives us probabilities</span> <span
  m='270460'>associated with a standard normal random variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='273610'>What if we're dealing with a normal random variable
  that</span> <span m='277320'>has a mean and a variance that are different from
  those of</span> <span m='281450'>the standard normal?</span> </p><p><span
  m='282820'>What can we do?</span> </p><p><span m='284280'>Well, there's a
  general trick that you can do to a random</span> <span m='288200'>variable,
  which is the following.</span> </p><p><span m='291409'>Let us define a new
  random variable Y in this fashion.</span> </p><p><span m='295770'>Y measures
  how far away is X from the mean value.</span> </p><p><span m='301030'>But
  because we divide by sigma, the standard deviation,</span> <span m='304610'>it
  measures this distance in standard deviations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='308920'>So if Y is equal to 3 it means that X is 3 standard</span> <span
  m='314190'>deviations away from the mean.</span> </p><p><span m='316320'>In
  general, Y measures how many deviations away from the</span> <span
  m='320540'>mean are you.</span> </p><p><span m='322270'>What properties does
  this random variable have?</span> </p><p><span m='325030'>The expected value
  of Y is going to be equal to 0,</span> <span m='330080'>because we have X and
  we're subtracting the mean of X. So</span> <span m='333650'>the expected value
  of this term is equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='336890'>How about the
  variance of Y?</span> </p><p><span m='339690'>Whenever we multiply a random
  variable by a constant, the</span> <span m='343820'>variance gets multiplied
  by the square of that constant.</span> </p><p><span m='348300'>So we get this
  expression.</span> </p><p><span m='351320'>But the variance of X is sigma
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='354280'>So this is equal to 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='355980'>So starting from X, we have obtained a closely
  related</span> <span m='359500'>random variable Y that has the property that
  it has 0 mean</span> <span m='363460'>and unit variance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='365480'>If it also happens that X is a normal random variable, then
  Y</span> <span m='370990'>is going to be a standard normal random
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='374380'>So we have managed to relate X to a
  standard</span> <span m='378160'>normal random variable.</span> </p><p><span
  m='379940'>And perhaps you can rewrite this expression in this form,</span>
  <span m='383400'>X equals to mu plus sigma Y where Y is</span> <span
  m='389040'>now a standard normal.</span> </p><p><span m='392620'>So, instead
  of doing calculations having to do with</span> <span m='395040'>X, we can try
  to calculate in terms of Y. And for Y we do</span> <span m='400220'>have
  available tables.</span> </p><p><span m='402570'>Let us look at an example of
  how this is done.</span> </p><p><span m='406300'>The way to calculate
  probabilities associated with</span> <span m='409210'>general normal random
  variables is to take the event</span> <span m='413560'>whose probability we
  want calculated and express it in</span> <span m='418140'>terms of standard
  normal random variables.</span> </p><p><span m='420690'>And then use the
  standard normal tables.</span> </p><p><span m='423810'>Let us see how this is
  done in terms of an example.</span> </p><p><span m='427090'>Suppose that X is
  normal with mean 6 and variance 4, so that</span> <span m='433000'>the
  standard deviation sigma is equal to 2.</span> </p><p><span m='435780'>And
  suppose that we want to calculate the probability that</span> <span
  m='439080'>X lies between 2 and 8.</span> </p><p><span m='450520'>Here's how
  we can proceed.</span> </p><p><span m='453200'>This event is the same as the
  event that X minus 6 takes a</span> <span m='459140'>value between 2 minus 6
  and 8 minus 6.</span> </p><p><span m='463220'>This event is the same as the
  original event we were</span> <span m='465790'>interested in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='467590'>We can also divide both sides of this inequality by
  the</span> <span m='470890'>standard deviation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='472420'>And the event of interest has now been</span> <span
  m='475040'>expressed in this form.</span> </p><p><span m='479430'>But at this
  point we recognize that this is of the form X</span> <span m='483830'>minus mu
  over sigma.</span> </p><p><span m='486390'>So this random variable here is a
  standard</span> <span m='489430'>normal random variable.</span> </p><p><span
  m='494090'>So the probability that X lies between 2 and 8 is the same
  as</span> <span m='504530'>the probability that a standard normal
  random</span> <span m='507600'>variable, call it Y, falls between these
  numbers minus 4</span> <span m='512350'>divided by 2, that's minus 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='515090'>Then Y less than 1.</span> </p><p><span m='520960'>And
  now we can use the standard normal tables to</span> <span m='524340'>calculate
  this probability.</span> </p><p><span m='526210'>We have here 1 and here we
  have minus 2.</span> </p><p><span m='529960'>And we want to find the
  probability that our standard</span> <span m='532790'>normal falls inside this
  range.</span> </p><p><span m='535660'>This is the probability that it is less
  than 1.</span> </p><p><span m='539420'>But we need to subtract the probability
  of that tail so</span> <span m='542640'>that we're left just with this
  intermediate area.</span> </p><p><span m='546850'>So this is the probability
  that Y is less than 1 minus</span> <span m='551970'>the probability that Y is
  less than minus 2.</span> </p><p><span m='557390'>And finally, as we discussed
  earlier, the probability that</span> <span m='561520'>Y is less than minus 2,
  this is 1 minus the probability</span> <span m='567360'>that Y is less than or
  equal to 2.</span> </p><p><span m='571690'>And now we can go to the normal
  tables, identify the</span> <span m='575670'>values that we're interested in,
  the probability that Y is</span> <span m='578660'>less than 1, the probability
  that Y is less than 2, and</span> <span m='581970'>plug these in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='583440'>And this gives us the desired probability.</span>
  </p><p><span m='586250'>Again, the key step is to take the event of interest
  and by</span> <span m='593450'>subtracting the mean and dividing by the
  standard</span> <span m='595530'>deviation express that same event in an
  equivalent form,</span> <span m='599740'>but which now involves a
  standard</span> <span m='602240'>normal random variable.</span> </p><p><span
  m='606880'>And then finally, use the standard normal tables.</span>
