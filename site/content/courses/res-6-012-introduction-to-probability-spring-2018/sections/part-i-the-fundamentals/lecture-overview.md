title: Lecture Overview
transcript: >-
  <p><span m="930">Welcome to the first lecture of this
  class.</span></p><p><span m="4050">You may be used to having a first lecture
  devoted to</span> <span m="6860">general comments and motivating
  examples.</span></p><p><span m="9670">This one will be
  different.</span></p><p><span m="11020">We will dive into the heart of the
  subject right away.</span></p><p><span m="14500">In fact, today we will
  accomplish a lot.</span></p><p><span m="16920">By the end of this lecture, you
  will know about all of the</span> <span m="20030">elements of a probabilistic
  model.</span></p><p><span m="23120">A probabilistic model is a quantitative
  description of a</span> <span m="26060">situation, a phenomenon, or an
  experiment</span> <span m="29080">whose outcome is
  uncertain.</span></p><p><span m="31320">Putting together such a model involves
  two key steps.</span></p><p><span m="34850">First, we need to describe the
  possible outcomes of the</span> <span m="38140">experiment.</span></p><p><span
  m="39320">This is done by specifying a so-called sample
  space.</span></p><p><span m="42910">And then, we specify a probability law,
  which assigns</span> <span m="46170">probabilities to outcomes or to
  collections of outcomes.</span></p><p><span m="50060">The probability law
  tells us, for example, whether one</span> <span m="53360">outcome is much more
  likely than some other outcome.</span></p><p><span m="57110">Probabilities
  have to satisfy certain basic properties in</span> <span m="60640">order to be
  meaningful.</span></p><p><span m="62070">These are the axioms of probability
  theory.</span></p><p><span m="65069">For example probabilities cannot be
  negative.</span></p><p><span m="68370">Interestingly, there will be very few
  axioms, but they are</span> <span m="71940">powerful, and we will see that
  they have lots of</span> <span m="74890">consequences.</span></p><p><span
  m="76220">We will see that they imply many other properties that</span> <span
  m="79400">were not part of the axioms.</span></p><p><span m="82480">We will
  then go through a couple of very simple examples</span> <span
  m="85510">involving models with either discrete</span> <span m="87789">or
  continuous outcomes.</span></p><p><span m="89730">As you will be seeing many
  times in this class, discrete</span> <span m="92690">models are conceptually
  much easier.</span></p><p><span m="95070">Continuous models involve some more
  sophisticated concepts,</span> <span m="99160">and we will point out some of
  the subtle issues that arise.</span></p><p><span m="103270">And finally, we
  will talk a little bit about the big</span> <span m="105880">picture, about
  the role of probability theory, and its</span> <span m="109560">relation with
  the real world.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
