title: Conditional Expectation as a Random Variable
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='650'>In this segment we revisit the concept of conditional</span>
  <span m='4210'>expectation and view it as an abstract object</span> <span
  m='8170'>of a special kind.</span> </p><p><span m='9930'>To get going, let us
  start with something simple, the</span> <span m='12650'>concept of a
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='13840'>Let's say a function h that maps
  real</span> <span m='16379'>numbers to real numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='18130'>As a concrete instance, consider the quadratic</span> <span
  m='20520'>function that maps a number x to its square.</span> </p><p><span
  m='25180'>Consider now a random variable, capital X. What do</span> <span
  m='29370'>we mean when we write h of X?</span> </p><p><span m='33710'>For h
  defined--</span> <span m='35860'>for example in this particular way as a
  quadratic function--</span> <span m='39990'>h of X is defined to be a random
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='44770'>Which random variable?</span>
  </p><p><span m='46500'>It is the random variable that takes the value little
  x</span> <span m='49250'>squared whenever capital X, the random variable,
  happens</span> <span m='53700'>to take the value little x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56690'>And this is the random variable that we usually</span> <span
  m='59700'>denote as the random variable X squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='64080'>Now let this come to conditional expectations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='66810'>The conditional expectation of a discrete random variable is</span>
  <span m='69780'>defined by this formula.</span> </p><p><span m='71480'>It is
  like the ordinary expectation except that we now</span> <span m='75490'>live
  in a conditional universe in which the random variable</span> <span
  m='79060'>capital Y is known to have taken a value little y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='83650'>And therefore, instead of using the ordinary formula
  for</span> <span m='87490'>expectations that involve the PMF of X, we now use
  that</span> <span m='91990'>formula but with the conditional PMF of X, which
  is</span> <span m='96400'>the appropriate PMF that applies to</span> <span
  m='98860'>this conditional universe.</span> </p><p><span m='101450'>And if it
  happens that the random variable capital X is</span> <span
  m='104250'>continuous, we would have an alternative formula but of the</span>
  <span m='107289'>same kind, where the summation is replaced by an integral
  and</span> <span m='111120'>the PMF is replaced by a PDF.</span> </p><p><span
  m='114789'>Now let us look at this quantity here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='117910'>We have fixed some particular little y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='120650'>Calculate this quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='122020'>And what we
  get is a number.</span> </p><p><span m='125390'>It is a number, but the value
  of that number depends on the</span> <span m='129949'>choice of little
  y.</span> </p><p><span m='131840'>If I give you a different little y then you
  will get</span> <span m='135080'>another number for this conditional
  expectation.</span> </p><p><span m='138260'>This means that this quantity here
  is really a</span> <span m='141170'>function of little y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143290'>And let us give a name to this function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='145579'>Let us call this function g.</span> </p><p><span m='149800'>Now
  that we have defined g we can ask, what is this object?</span> </p><p><span
  m='156670'>It's a function of capital Y. It's a</span> <span
  m='159500'>function of a random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='160860'>So it
  should be a random variable by itself.</span> </p><p><span m='164030'>By
  analogy, with the earlier concrete example, it is the</span> <span
  m='168590'>random variable that takes the numerical value g of little y</span>
  <span m='175579'>whenever capital Y happens to take the value little y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='179300'>But g of little y has been defined to be the same as
  this</span> <span m='183080'>conditional expectation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='185150'>So it's the random variable whose value is this</span> <span
  m='188230'>conditional expectation, which is a particular number, if</span>
  <span m='191940'>capital y happens to take the value little y.</span>
  </p><p><span m='196150'>This particular random variable that we have
  defined</span> <span m='199200'>here, g of capital Y, we call it the abstract
  conditional</span> <span m='203590'>expectation of the random variable X,
  given the random</span> <span m='207820'>variable Y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='209860'>To summarize, this notation here stands</span> <span m='213960'>for
  a random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='215665'>It is the random variable
  whose numerical value turns</span> <span m='219590'>out to be this one if the
  value of the random variable</span> <span m='223510'>capital Y happens to be
  little y.</span> </p><p><span m='228550'>It is a function of capital Y. Once
  we know the value of</span> <span m='232640'>capital Y, then the value of the
  conditional expectation is</span> <span m='237850'>well defined.</span>
  </p><p><span m='238950'>It is known.</span> </p><p><span m='240100'>And it's
  equal to this particular number.</span> </p><p><span m='243600'>It is of
  course a random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='245690'>And as a random
  variable, it has all the attributes that</span> <span m='248720'>random
  variables have.</span> </p><p><span m='250320'>For example, it has a
  distribution, that</span> <span m='252440'>is, a PMF or a PDF.</span>
  </p><p><span m='254250'>It has a mean of its own.</span> </p><p><span
  m='256399'>And it has a variance of its own.</span> </p><p><span m='258829'>So
  what will be next in our agenda is to talk about these</span> <span
  m='262680'>attributes of this special random variable, and also to</span>
  <span m='267820'>use it in several examples.</span> </p><p></p>
