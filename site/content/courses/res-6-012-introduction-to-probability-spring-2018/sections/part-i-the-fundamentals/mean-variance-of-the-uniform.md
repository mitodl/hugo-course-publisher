title: Mean & Variance of the Uniform
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='1690'>As an example of a mean-variance calculation, we</span>
  <span m='4890'>will now consider the continuous uniform random</span> <span
  m='7520'>variable which we have introduced a little earlier.</span>
  </p><p><span m='10610'>This is the continuous analog of the discrete uniform,
  for</span> <span m='13600'>which we have already seen formulas for the
  corresponding</span> <span m='16500'>mean and variance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='17800'>So let us now calculate the mean or expected value for the</span>
  <span m='21280'>continuous case.</span> </p><p><span m='23090'>The mean is
  defined as an integral that ranges over the</span> <span m='26660'>entire real
  line.</span> </p><p><span m='28170'>On the other hand, we recognize that the
  density is</span> <span m='31100'>equal to 0 outside the interval from a to b,
  and</span> <span m='36210'>therefore, there is going to be no contribution to
  the</span> <span m='38740'>integral from those x's outside that
  interval.</span> </p><p><span m='42940'>This means that we can integrate just
  over the</span> <span m='46460'>interval from a to b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='49290'>And inside that interval, the value of the density is 1</span> <span
  m='52890'>over b minus a.</span> </p><p><span m='55110'>We can carry out this
  integration and find an answer</span> <span m='59270'>equal to a plus b over
  2, which, interestingly, also</span> <span m='64360'>happens to be the same as
  in the discrete case.</span> </p><p><span m='67080'>In fact, we could find
  this answer without having to run</span> <span m='71200'>this
  integration.</span> </p><p><span m='72789'>We could just recognize that this
  PDF is symmetric around</span> <span m='77060'>the midpoint of the interval,
  and the midpoint is</span> <span m='80030'>a plus b over 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='83630'>We now continue with what is involved in the
  calculation of</span> <span m='88340'>the expected value of the square of the
  random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='93310'>Using the expected value rule,
  this is the integral of x</span> <span m='97620'>squared times the density,
  but because of the same argument</span> <span m='104720'>as before, we only
  need to integrate from a to b.</span> </p><p><span m='109490'>We can evaluate
  this integral, and the answer turns out to be</span> <span m='113360'>1 over
  (b minus a) times (b cube over 3</span> <span m='119479'>minus a cube over
  3).</span> </p><p><span m='123010'>The reason why these cubic terms appear is
  that the</span> <span m='126690'>integral of the x square function is x</span>
  <span m='130440'>cube divided by 3.</span> </p><p><span m='133440'>Now that we
  have this quantity available, we're ready to</span> <span m='136620'>calculate
  the variance using this alternative formula,</span> <span m='141829'>which, as
  we have often discussed, usually provides us</span> <span m='145650'>a quicker
  way to carry out the calculation.</span> </p><p><span m='149880'>We take this
  term, insert it here.</span> </p><p><span m='152930'>We take the square of
  this term, insert it here.</span> </p><p><span m='156270'>Carry out some
  algebra, and eventually we find an answer</span> <span m='160610'>which is
  equal to b minus a squared over 12.</span> </p><p><span m='166490'>And this is
  the formula for the variance of a uniform</span> <span m='170140'>random
  variable.</span> </p><p><span m='172650'>We can take the square root of this
  expression to find the</span> <span m='176550'>standard deviation, and the
  standard deviation is going to</span> <span m='179750'>be b minus a divided by
  the square root of 12.</span> </p><p><span m='185820'>A few
  observations.</span> </p><p><span m='187830'>First, the formula looks quite
  similar to the formula for the</span> <span m='191350'>variance that we had in
  the discrete case, except that in</span> <span m='194040'>the discrete case,
  we have this extra</span> <span m='196579'>additive factor of 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='200440'>More interestingly, and perhaps more important,
  is</span> <span m='203500'>that the standard deviation is proportional to the
  width of</span> <span m='208000'>this uniform.</span> </p><p><span
  m='209370'>The wider it is, the larger the standard</span> <span
  m='212420'>deviation will be.</span> </p><p><span m='213860'>And this conforms
  to our intuition that the standard</span> <span m='217100'>deviation captures
  the width of a particular distribution.</span> </p><p><span m='221660'>And the
  variance, of course, becomes larger when</span> <span m='224190'>the width is
  larger.</span> </p><p><span m='225710'>And as far as the variance is
  concerned, it increases with</span> <span m='228540'>the square of the length
  of the interval over which we</span> <span m='231670'>have our
  distribution.</span> </p><p></p>
