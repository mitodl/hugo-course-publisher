title: The PMF of a Function of a Discrete Random Variable
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='560'>As a warm-up towards finding the distribution of the</span>
  <span m='3460'>function of random variables, let us start by
  considering</span> <span m='6860'>the discrete case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8200'>So let X be a discrete random variable and let Y be defined</span>
  <span m='14160'>as a given function of X. We know the PMF of X and wish
  to</span> <span m='19190'>find the PMF of Y. Here's a simple example.</span>
  </p><p><span m='23130'>The random variable X takes the values 2, 3, 4, and 5
  with</span> <span m='26800'>the probabilities given in the figure, and Y is
  the function</span> <span m='32049'>indicated here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='33870'>Then, for example, the probability that Y takes a</span> <span
  m='39000'>value of 4.</span> </p><p><span m='40780'>This is also the value of
  the PMF of Y evaluated at 4.</span> </p><p><span m='46500'>This is simply the
  sum of the probabilities of the possible</span> <span m='51610'>values of X
  that give rise to a value of Y</span> <span m='55890'>that is equal to
  4.</span> </p><p><span m='57870'>Therefore, this expression is equal to the
  probability that</span> <span m='63670'>X equals to 4 plus the probability
  that</span> <span m='68100'>X is equal to 5.</span> </p><p><span m='70560'>Or,
  in PMF notation, we can write it in this manner.</span> </p><p><span
  m='80380'>And in this numerical example, it would be 0.3 plus 0.4.</span>
  </p><p><span m='86990'>More generally, for any given value of little y,
  the</span> <span m='91890'>probability that the random variable capital Y
  takes this</span> <span m='96520'>particular value is the sum of the
  probabilities of the</span> <span m='100280'>little x that result in that
  particular value.</span> </p><p><span m='104150'>So the probability that the
  random variable capital Y,</span> <span m='107070'>which is the same as g of
  X, takes on a specific value is</span> <span m='111100'>the sum of the
  probabilities of all possible values of</span> <span m='116060'>little x where
  we only consider those values of</span> <span m='120140'>little x that give
  rise to the specific value, little y, that</span> <span m='125040'>you're
  interested.</span> </p><p><span m='127080'>Let us now look into the special
  case where we have a</span> <span m='129728'>linear function of a discrete
  random variable.</span> </p><p><span m='132420'>Suppose that X is described by
  the PMF shown in this diagram,</span> <span m='136060'>and let us consider the
  random variable Z, which is defined</span> <span m='139500'>as 2 times X. We
  would like to plot the PMF of Z.</span> </p><p><span m='143950'>First, let us
  note the values that Z can take.</span> </p><p><span m='147540'>When X is
  equal to minus 1, Z is going to be</span> <span m='151340'>equal to minus
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='152960'>When X is equal to 1, Z is going to be equal
  to 2.</span> </p><p><span m='156280'>And when X is equal to 2, Z is going to
  be equal to 4.</span> </p><p><span m='160870'>This event that X is equal to
  minus 1 happens with</span> <span m='163590'>probability 2/6, and when that
  event happens, Z will take a</span> <span m='167460'>value of minus 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='168980'>So this event happens with probability 2/6.</span>
  </p><p><span m='173590'>With probability 1/6, X takes a value of 1 so that Z
  takes a</span> <span m='178560'>value of 2.</span> </p><p><span m='180320'>And
  this happens with probability 1/6.</span> </p><p><span m='182210'>6 And
  finally, this last event here happens</span> <span m='185830'>with probability
  3/6.</span> </p><p><span m='188810'>We have thus found the PMF of Z. Notice
  that it has the same</span> <span m='192930'>shape as the PMF of X, except
  that it is stretched or scaled</span> <span m='198100'>horizontally by a
  factor of 2.</span> </p><p><span m='201300'>Let us now consider the random
  variable Y, defined as 2X plus</span> <span m='205020'>3, or what is the same
  as Z plus 3.</span> </p><p><span m='212460'>With probability 2/6, Z is equal
  to minus 2.</span> </p><p><span m='216960'>And in that case, Y is going to be
  equal to plus 1.</span> </p><p><span m='222350'>And this event happens with
  probability 2/6.</span> </p><p><span m='228340'>With probability 1/6, Z takes
  a value of 2 so that Y it</span> <span m='233700'>takes a value of 5.</span>
  </p><p><span m='239090'>And finally, with probability 3/6, Z takes a value of
  4 so</span> <span m='244390'>that Y it takes a value of 7.</span> </p><p><span
  m='253170'>What we see here is that the PMF of Y has exactly the same</span>
  <span m='257990'>shape as the PMF of Z, except that it is shifted to
  the</span> <span m='262270'>right by 3.</span> </p><p><span m='265530'>To
  summarize, in order to find the PMF of a linear function</span> <span
  m='269390'>such as 2X plus 3, what we do is that we first stretch the</span>
  <span m='273909'>PMF of X by a factor of 2 and then shift it</span> <span
  m='278070'>horizontally by 3.</span> </p><p><span m='281110'>We can also
  describe the PMF of Y through a formula.</span> </p><p><span m='285620'>For
  any given value of little y, the PMF is going to be</span> <span
  m='291510'>equal to the probability that our random variable Y takes on</span>
  <span m='295390'>the specific value little y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='297990'>Then we recall that Y has been defined in our example to be</span>
  <span m='302140'>equal to 2X plus 3, so we're looking at the probability
  of</span> <span m='306230'>this event.</span> </p><p><span m='308940'>But this
  is the same as the event that X takes a value</span> <span m='315040'>equal to
  y minus 3 divided by 2.</span> </p><p><span m='322240'>And in PMF notation, we
  can write it in this form.</span> </p><p><span m='330730'>So what this is
  saying is that the probability that Y takes</span> <span m='335200'>on a
  specific value is the same as the probability that X</span> <span
  m='340380'>takes on some other specific value.</span> </p><p><span
  m='343180'>And that value here is that value of X that would give</span> <span
  m='347950'>rise to this particular value little y.</span> </p><p><span
  m='352300'>Now, we can generalize the calculation that we just did.</span>
  </p><p><span m='355680'>And more generally, if we have a linear function of
  a</span> <span m='359540'>discrete random variable X, the PMF of the random
  variable</span> <span m='363220'>Y is given by this formula in terms of the
  PMF of the random</span> <span m='367590'>variable X. The derivation is the
  same.</span> </p><p><span m='370460'>We use b instead the specific number 3,
  and we have a</span> <span m='376330'>general constant a instead of the 2
  that</span> <span m='379280'>we had in this example.</span> </p><p><span
  m='381050'>And this formula describes exactly what we did</span> <span
  m='383660'>graphically in our previous example.</span> </p><p><span
  m='387120'>This factor of a here serves to stretch the PMF by a factor</span>
  <span m='391720'>of a, and this term b here serves to shift the PMF by
  b.</span> </p><p></p>
