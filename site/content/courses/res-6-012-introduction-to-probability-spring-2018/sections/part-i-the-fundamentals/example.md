  <p><span m="400">Let us now consider a simple example.</span></p><p><span
  m="3200">Let random variables X and Y be described by a joint PMF</span> <span
  m="7460">which is the one shown in this table.</span></p><p><span
  m="9820">Question--</span> <span m="10990">are X and Y
  independent?</span></p><p><span m="14190">We can try to answer this question
  by using the</span> <span m="16910">definition of
  independence.</span></p><p><span m="18670">But it is actually more instructive
  to proceed in a</span> <span m="22320">somewhat more intuitive
  way.</span></p><p><span m="24660">We look at this table, and we observe that
  the value of one</span> <span m="29320">is possible for X. In particular, the
  probability</span> <span m="33000">that X takes the value of one, this is the
  marginal</span> <span m="36950">probability, this can be found by adding the
  probabilities of</span> <span m="41690">all of the outcomes in this column,
  which, in this case,</span> <span m="45580">is 3 over 20.</span></p><p><span
  m="48710">Suppose now that somebody tells you the value of Y. For</span> <span
  m="52560">example, I tell you that Y happens to be equal to one, in</span>
  <span m="57430">which case you are transported into this
  universe.</span></p><p><span m="62100">In this universe, the conditional
  probability that X</span> <span m="66110">takes a value of one, given that Y
  takes a value of one,</span> <span m="70510">what is it?</span></p><p><span
  m="72100">In this universe, there's zero probability</span> <span
  m="74800">associated to this outcome.</span></p><p><span m="77070">So this
  probability is zero, which is</span> <span m="79660">different than 3 over
  20.</span></p><p><span m="83010">And since these two numbers are different,
  this means that</span> <span m="86789">information from Y changes our beliefs
  about what's going to</span> <span m="91720">happen to X. And so, we do not
  have independence.</span></p><p><span m="95600">So again, intuitively, in the
  beginning, we thought that X</span> <span m="100009">equal to one was
  possible.</span></p><p><span m="102380">But information given by Y, namely
  that Y is equal to one,</span> <span m="107360">tells us that, actually, X
  equals to one is impossible.</span></p><p><span m="111360">Information about Y
  changed our beliefs about X, so X and</span> <span m="116700">Y are
  dependent.</span></p><p><span m="120540">Now, when we first introduced the
  notion of independence</span> <span m="123510">some time ago, we also
  introduced the notion of</span> <span m="126310">conditional
  independence.</span></p><p><span m="127620">And we said that conditional
  independence is the same as</span> <span m="130500">ordinary independence,
  except that it would be applied to a</span> <span m="135940">conditional
  universe.</span></p><p><span m="138880">Something similar can be done for the
  case of random</span> <span m="141480">variables as well.</span></p><p><span
  m="142960">So suppose, for example, that someone tells us that the</span>
  <span m="149030">outcome of the experiment was such that it belongs</span>
  <span m="152680">to this blue set.</span></p><p><span m="155250">This is the
  set where X is less than or equal to 2, and Y</span> <span m="158960">is
  larger than or equal to three.</span></p><p><span m="161250">So we're given
  this information, and this is now</span> <span m="164420">our new conditional
  model.</span></p><p><span m="167050">The question is, within this new
  conditional model are</span> <span m="171600">random variables X and Y
  independent?</span></p><p><span m="175079">Let's just right down the
  conditional model, where I'm</span> <span m="178440">only showing the four
  possible outcomes that are allowed in</span> <span m="182610">the conditional
  model.</span></p><p><span m="183850">All the others, of course, will have zero
  probability in</span> <span m="186810">the conditional
  model.</span></p><p><span m="188540">So in the conditional model,
  probabilities will keep the</span> <span m="192110">same proportions as in the
  unconditional model--</span> <span m="196260">and the proportions are 1, 2, 2,
  4--</span> <span m="199260">but then they need to be scaled, or normalized, so
  that</span> <span m="202990">they add to 1.</span></p><p><span m="204810">And
  to make them add to 1, we need to divide them all by 9.</span></p><p><span
  m="210030">In this conditional model, this is the joint PMF of the</span>
  <span m="214520">two random variables X and Y. Let us find the marginal
  PMFs.</span></p><p><span m="219400">To find the marginal PMF of X, we add
  the</span> <span m="222020">entries in this column.</span></p><p><span
  m="223300">And we get here 1/3, and here 2/3.</span></p><p><span
  m="227829">And to find the marginal PMF of y, we add the</span> <span
  m="230829">entries in this [row]</span> <span m="232110">to find
  2/3.</span></p><p><span m="234090">And we adds the entries in that
  [row]</span> <span m="235940">to find 1/3.</span></p><p><span m="238020">So
  this is the marginal PMF of x.</span></p><p><span m="240000">That's the
  marginal PMF of Y. And now we notice that this</span> <span m="244900">entry
  of the joint PMF is 1/3 times 1/3, the</span> <span m="248670">product of the
  marginals.</span></p><p><span m="250300">This entry is the product of 1/3
  times 2/3, the product of</span> <span m="254560">the marginals, and so on for
  the remaining entries.</span></p><p><span m="258070">So each entry of the
  joint PMF is equal to the product of the</span> <span m="262670">corresponding
  entries of the marginal PMFs.</span></p><p><span m="265680">And this is the
  definition of independence.</span></p><p><span m="269670">So in this
  conditional blue universe, we do have</span> <span
  m="273670">independence.</span></p><p><span m="275210">And the way that this
  was established was to check that</span> <span m="278909">the joint PMF
  factors as a product of marginal PMFs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
