  MIT courses,</span> <span m='14860'>visit MIT OpenCourseWare at
  ocw.mit.edu.</span> <span m='25120'>PROFESSOR: All right. So today's task is
  going to be to outline some of the basic experimental</span> <span
  m='31740'>facts that we will both have to deal with and that our aim should be
  to understand and</span> <span m='37910'>model through the rest of the
  course.</span> <span m='41210'>Physics doesn't tell you some abstract truth
  about why the universe is the way it is. Physics</span> <span m='46019'>gives
  you models to understand how things work and predict what will happen next.
  And</span> <span m='51280'>what we will be aiming to do is develop models that
  give us an intuition for the phenomena</span> <span m='55309'>and allow us to
  make predictions. And these are going to be the experimental facts I
  would</span> <span m='58859'>like to both explain, develop an intuition for,
  and be able to predict consequences of.</span> <span m='65930'>So we'll start
  off with-- so let me just outline them. So, first fact, atoms exist. I'll
  go</span> <span m='75530'>over some of the arguments for that. Randomness,
  definitely present in the world. Atomic spectre</span> <span m='79750'>are
  discrete and structured. We have a photoelectric effect, which I'll describe
  in some detail.</span> <span m='85420'>Electrons do some funny things. In
  particular electron diffraction. And sixth and finally,</span> <span
  m='91009'>Bell's Inequality. Something that we will come back to at the very
  end of the class,</span> <span m='94950'>which I like to think of as a sort of
  a frame for the entirety of 8.04.</span> <span m='101530'>So... we'll stick
  with this for the moment.</span> <span m='107600'>So everyone in here knows
  that atoms are made of electrons and nuclei. In particular, you</span> <span
  m='115200'>know that electrons exist because you've seen a cathode ray tube. I
  used to be able to say</span> <span m='119340'>you've seen a TV, but you all
  have flat panel TVs, so this is useless. So a cathode ray</span> <span
  m='123119'>tube is a gun that shoots electrons at a phosphorescent screen. And
  every time the electron hits the</span> <span m='128600'>screen it induces a
  little phosphorescence, a little glow. And that's how you see on a</span>
  <span m='133140'>CRT.</span> <span m='135300'>And so as was pithily stated
  long ago by a very famous physicist, if you can spray them,</span> <span
  m='143220'>they exist. Pretty good argument. There's a better argument for the
  existence of electrons,</span> <span m='150150'>which is that we can actually
  see them individually.</span> <span m='152879'>And this is one of the most
  famous images in high-energy physics. It's from an experiment</span> <span
  m='157480'>called Gargamelle, which was a 30-cubic meter tank of liquid freon
  pulsing just at its vapor</span> <span m='167950'>pressure 60 times a second.
  And what this image is is, apart from all the schmut, you're</span> <span
  m='173340'>watching a trail of bubbles in this de-pressurizing freon that
  wants to create bubbles but you</span> <span m='178079'>have to nucleate
  bubbles. What you're seeing there in that central line that goes up and</span>
  <span m='182159'>then curls around is a single electron that was nailed by a
  neutrino incident from a beam</span> <span m='187790'>at CERN where currently
  the LHC is running.</span> <span m='191599'>And this experiment revealed two
  things. First, to us it will reveal that you can see individual</span> <span
  m='196590'>electrons and by studying the images of them moving through fluids
  and leaving a disturbing</span> <span m='201019'>wake of bubbles behind them.
  We can study their properties in some considerable detail.</span> <span
  m='205709'>The second thing it taught us is something new-- we're not going to
  talk about it in</span> <span m='208760'>detail-- is that it's possible for a
  neutrino to hit an electron. And that process is called</span> <span
  m='213989'>a weak neutral current for sort of stupid historical reasons. It's
  actually a really</span> <span m='218099'>good name. And that was awesome and
  surprising and so this picture is both a monument to</span> <span
  m='224829'>the technology of the experiment, but also to the physics of weak
  neutral currents and</span> <span m='228790'>electrons. They exist if you can
  discover neutrinos by watching them. OK.</span> <span m='233420'>Secondly,
  nuclei. We know that nuclei exist because you can shoot alpha particles,
  which</span> <span m='238220'>come from radioactive decay, at atoms. And you
  have your atom which is some sort of vague</span> <span m='244620'>thing, and
  I'm gonna make the-- I'm gonna find the atom by making a sheet of
  atoms.</span> <span m='248430'>Maybe a foil. A very thin foil of stuff. And
  then I'm gonna shoot very high-energy alpha</span> <span m='253459'>particles
  incident of this.</span> <span m='255390'>Probably everyone has heard of this
  experiment, it was done by Rutherford and Geiger and Marsden,</span> <span
  m='259470'>in particular his students at the time or post-docs. I don't
  recall-- and you shoot</span> <span m='263660'>these alpha particles in. And
  if you think of these guys as some sort of jelly-ish lump</span> <span
  m='267080'>then maybe they'll deflect a little bit, but if you shoot a bullet
  through Jello it just</span> <span m='271000'>sort of maybe gets deflected a
  little bit. But Jello, I mean, come on.</span> <span m='274390'>And I think
  what was shocking is that you should these alpha particles in and every</span>
  <span m='276790'>once in a while, they bounce back at, you know, 180, 160
  degrees. Rutherford likened</span> <span m='281940'>this to rolling a bowling
  ball against a piece of paper and having it bounce back. Kind of</span> <span
  m='289630'>surprising. And the explanation here that people eventually came up
  upon is that atoms</span> <span m='293470'>are mostly zero density. Except
  they have very, very high density cores, which are many</span> <span
  m='300170'>times smaller than the size of the atom but where most of the mass
  is concentrated. And</span> <span m='304430'>as a consequence, most of the
  inertia.</span> <span m='306700'>And so we know that atoms have substructure,
  and the picture we have is that well if you</span> <span m='310920'>scrape
  this pile of metal, you can pull off the electrons, leaving behind nuclei
  which</span> <span m='315860'>have positive charge because you've scraped off
  the electrons that have negative charge.</span> <span m='319440'>So we have a
  picture from these experiments that there are electrons and there are
  nuclei--</span> <span m='323720'>which, I'll just write N and plus-- which are
  the constituents of atoms.</span> <span m='329650'>Now this leads to a very
  natural picture of what an atom is. If you're a 19th-century</span> <span
  m='333820'>physicist, or even an early 20th-century physicist, it's very
  natural to say, aha, well if I know</span> <span m='337990'>if I have a
  positive charge and I have a negative charge, then they attract each other
  with</span> <span m='342840'>a 1 over r minus q1 q2-- sorry, q1 q2 over r
  potential. This is just like gravity, right.</span> <span m='349530'>The earth
  and the sun are attracted with an inverse-r potential. This leads to
  Keplerian</span> <span m='354030'>orbits. And so maybe an atom is just some
  sort of orbiting classical combination of</span> <span m='359880'>an electron
  and a nucleus, positively charged nucleus.</span> <span m='363290'>The problem
  with this picture, as you explore in detail in your first problem on the
  problem</span> <span m='367840'>set, is that it doesn't work. What happens
  when you accelerate a charge? It radiates.</span> <span m='373790'>Exactly. So
  if it's radiating, it's gotta lose energy. It's dumping energy into
  this--</span> <span m='377600'>out of the system. So it's gotta fall lower
  into the potential. Well it falls lower, it</span> <span m='382040'>speeds up.
  It radiates more. Because it's accelerating more to stay in a circular
  orbit.</span> <span m='385930'>All right, it radiates more, it has to fall
  further down.</span> <span m='388380'>So on the problem set you're going to
  calculate how long that takes. And it's not very long.</span> <span
  m='392520'>And so the fact that we persist for more than a few picoseconds
  tells you that it's not</span> <span m='397120'>that-- this is not a correct
  picture of an atom. OK.</span> <span m='402220'>So in classical mechanics,
  atoms could not exist. And yet, atoms exist. So we have to</span> <span
  m='407870'>explain that. That's gonna be our first challenge. Now
  interestingly Geiger who is this collaborator</span> <span m='416880'>of
  Rutherford, a young junior collaborator of Rutherford, went on to develop a
  really</span> <span m='421380'>neat instrument. So suppose you want to see
  radiation. We do this all the time. I'm looking</span> <span m='426190'>at you
  and I'm seeing radiation, seeing light. But I'm not seeing ultra high energy
  radiation,</span> <span m='429570'>I'm seeing energy radiation in the
  electromagnetic waves in the optical spectrum.</span> <span
  m='433540'>Meanwhile I'm also not seeing alpha particles. So what Geiger
  wanted was a way to detect</span> <span m='439370'>without using your eyes
  radiation that's hard to see. So the way he did this is he took</span> <span
  m='444860'>a capacitor and he filled the-- surrounded the capacitor with some
  noble gas. It doesn't</span> <span m='449470'>interact. There's no-- it's very
  hard to ionize. And if you crank up the potential across this</span> <span
  m='456190'>capacitor plate high enough, what do you get? A spark. You all know
  this, if you crank up</span> <span m='463409'>a capacitor it eventually breaks
  down because the dielectric in between breaks down, you</span> <span
  m='466600'>get a spontaneous sparking.</span> <span m='468080'>So what do you
  figure it would look if I take a capacitor plate and I charge it up,
  but</span> <span m='471840'>not quite to breakdown. Just a good potential. And
  another charged particle comes flying</span> <span m='477050'>through, like an
  alpha particle, which carries a charge of plus 2, that positive charge
  will</span> <span m='480950'>disturb things and will add extra field
  effectively. And lead to the nucleation of a spark.</span> <span m='486620'>So
  the presence of a spark when this potential is not strong enough to induce a
  spark spontaneously</span> <span m='490830'>indicates the passage of a charged
  particle. Geiger worked later with-- Marsden? Muller.</span> <span
  m='497200'>Heck. I don't even remember. And developed this into a device now
  known as the Geiger</span> <span m='504270'>counter. And so you've probably
  all seen or heard Geiger counters going off in movies,</span> <span
  m='511210'>right. They go ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping ping, right.
  They bounce off randomly.</span> <span m='516880'>This is an extremely
  important lesson, which is tantamount to the lesson of our second</span> <span
  m='520860'>experiment yesterday. The 50-50, when we didn't expect it. The
  white electrons into the harness</span> <span m='525520'>box then into a color
  box again, would come out 50-50, not 100 percent. And they come</span> <span
  m='529150'>out in a way that's unpredictable. We have no ability to our
  knowledge-- and more than</span> <span m='534030'>our knowledge, we'll come
  back to that with Bell's Inequality-- but we have no ability</span> <span
  m='536400'>to predict which electron will come out of that third box, white or
  black, right.</span> <span m='542000'>Similarly with a Geiger counter you hear
  that atoms decay, but they decay randomly. The</span> <span
  m='545270'>radiation comes out of a pile of radioactive material totally at
  random. We know the probabilistic</span> <span m='549510'>description of that.
  We're going to develop that, but we don't know exactly when. And</span> <span
  m='553710'>that's a really powerful example-- both of those experiments are
  powerful examples of</span> <span m='558510'>randomness.</span> <span
  m='559190'>And so we're going to have to incorporate that into our laws of
  physics into our model</span> <span m='562890'>of quantum phenomena as well.
  Questions? I usually have a Geiger counter at this point,</span> <span
  m='569800'>which is totally awesome, so I'll try to produce the Geiger counter
  demo later. But the person</span> <span m='574700'>with the Geiger counter
  turns out to have left the continent, so made it a little challenging.</span>
  <span m='581700'>OK. Just sort of since we're at MIT, an interesting side
  note. This strategy of so-called hard</span> <span m='588630'>scattering, of
  taking some object and sending it at very high velocity at some other
  object</span> <span m='594010'>and looking for the rare events when they
  bounce off at some large angle, so-called</span> <span m='598760'>hard
  scattering. Which is used to detect dense cores of objects. It didn't stop
  with Rutherford.</span> <span m='605070'>People didn't just give up at that
  point.</span> <span m='606680'>Similar experience in the '60s and '70s which
  are conducted at Slack, were involved not</span> <span m='612360'>alpha
  particles incident on atoms but individual electrons incident on protons. So
  not shooting</span> <span m='619140'>into the nucleus, but shooting and
  looking for the effect of hitting individual protons</span> <span
  m='622510'>inside the nucleus. And through this process it was discovered that
  in fact-- so this was</span> <span m='628250'>done in the '60s and '70s, that
  in fact the proton itself is also not a fundamental particle.</span> <span
  m='633630'>The proton is itself composite.</span> <span m='639170'>And in
  particular, it's made out of-- eventually people understood that it's made out
  of, morally</span> <span m='644140'>speaking, and I'm gonna put this in
  quotation marks-- ask me about it in office hours--</span> <span
  m='647210'>three quarks, which are some particles. And the reason we-- all
  this tells you is that</span> <span m='654400'>it's some object and we've
  given it the name quark. But indeed there are three point-like</span> <span
  m='657570'>particles that in some sense make up a proton. It's actually much
  more complicated than that,</span> <span m='661590'>but these quarks, among
  other things, have very strange properties. Like they have fractional</span>
  <span m='665230'>charge.</span> <span m='670220'>And this was discovered by a
  large group of people, in particular led by Kendall and Friedman</span> <span
  m='676320'>and also Richard Taylor. Kendall and Friedman were at MIT, Richard
  Taylor was at Stanford.</span> <span m='681600'>And in 1990 they shared the
  Nobel Prize for the discovery of the partonic structure out</span> <span
  m='686660'>of the nucleons. So these sorts of techniques that people have been
  using for a very long</span> <span m='691140'>time continue to be useful and
  awesome.</span> <span m='693190'>And in particular the experiment, the
  experimental version of this that's currently going on,</span> <span
  m='696700'>that I particularly love is something called the relativistic heavy
  ion collider, which</span> <span m='700240'>is going on at Brookhaven. So here
  what you're doing is you take two protons and you blow</span> <span
  m='703640'>them into each other at ultra high energy. Two protons, collide
  them and see what happens.</span> <span m='708320'>And that's what happens.
  You get massive shrapnel coming flying out. So instead of having a</span>
  <span m='714610'>simple thing where one of the protons just bounces because
  there's some hard quark, instead</span> <span m='717720'>what happens is just
  shrapnel everywhere, right. So you might think, well, how do we</span> <span
  m='723750'>interpret that at all. How do you make sense out of 14,000
  particles coming out of two</span> <span m='728700'>protons bouncing into each
  other. How does that make any sense? And the answer turns</span> <span
  m='733440'>out to be kind of awesome.</span> <span m='734480'>And so this
  touches on my research. So I want to make a quick comment on it just for
  color.</span> <span m='740110'>The answer turns out to be really interesting.
  First off, the interior constituents of protons</span> <span
  m='744370'>interact very strongly with each other. But at the brief moment
  when protons collide with</span> <span m='749850'>each other, what you
  actually form is not a point-like quirk and another point-like</span> <span
  m='755130'>quark. In fact, protons aren't made out of point-like quarks at
  all. Protons are big</span> <span m='758470'>bags with quarks and gluons and
  all sorts of particles fluctuating in and out of existence</span> <span
  m='762690'>in a complicated fashion.</span> <span m='764130'>And what you
  actually get is, amazingly, a liquid. For a brief, brief moment of time</span>
  <span m='770910'>the parts of those protons that overlap-- think of them as
  two spheres and they overlap</span> <span m='774290'>in some sort of
  almond-shaped region. The parts of those protons that overlap form a</span>
  <span m='777960'>liquid at ultra high temperature and at ultra high density.
  It's called the RHIC fireball</span> <span m='783380'>or the quark-gluon
  plasma, although it's not actually a plasma. But it's a liquid like</span>
  <span m='787000'>water. And what I mean by saying it's a liquid like water, if
  you push it, it spreads in</span> <span m='791380'>waves. And like water, it's
  dissipative. Those waves dissipate.</span> <span m='795400'>But it's a really
  funny bit of liquid.</span> <span m='798620'>Imagine you take your cup of
  coffee. You drink it, you're drinking your coffee as I am wont</span> <span
  m='802200'>to do, and it cools down over time. This is very frustrating. So
  you pour in a little</span> <span m='805790'>bit of hot coffee and when you
  pour in that hot coffee, the system is out of equilibrium.</span> <span
  m='809730'>It hasn't thermalized. So what you want is you want to wait for all
  of the system to</span> <span m='814300'>wait until it's come to equilibrium
  so you don't get a swig of hot or swig of cold. You</span> <span
  m='817660'>want some sort of Goldilocks-ean in between.</span> <span
  m='819620'>So you can ask how long does it take for this coffee to come to
  thermal equilibrium. Well</span> <span m='824710'>it takes a while. You know,
  a few seconds, a few minutes, depending on exactly how you</span> <span
  m='827990'>mess with it. But let me ask you a quick question. How does that
  time scale compare to the time</span> <span m='831850'>it takes for light to
  cross your mug? Much, much, much slower, right? By orders of magnitude.</span>
  <span m='840250'>For this liquid that's formed in the ultra high energy
  collision of two protons, the</span> <span m='845190'>time it takes for the
  system-- which starts out crazy out of equilibrium with all sorts</span> <span
  m='849779'>of quarks here and gluons there and stuff flying about-- the time
  it takes for it to</span> <span m='854350'>come to thermal equilibrium is of
  order the time it takes for light to cross the little</span> <span
  m='859990'>puddle of liquid. This is a crazy liquid, it's called a quantum
  liquid. And it has all</span> <span m='865430'>sorts of wonderful properties.
  And the best thing about it to my mind is that it's very</span> <span
  m='869040'>well modeled by black holes. Which is totally separate issue, but
  it's a fun example. So</span> <span m='875660'>from these sorts of collisions,
  we know a great deal about the existence of atoms and</span> <span
  m='881880'>randomness, as you can see. That's a fairly random sorting.</span>
  <span m='885160'>OK so moving on to more 8.04 things. Back to atoms. So let's
  look at specifics of that.</span> <span m='891150'>I'm not kidding, they
  really are related to black holes. I get paid for this. So here's</span> <span
  m='898630'>a nice fact, so let's get to atomic spectra. So to study atomic
  spectra, here's the experiment</span> <span m='903720'>I want to run. The
  experiment I want to run starts out with some sort of power plant.</span>
  <span m='908670'>And out of the power plant come two wires. And I'm going to
  run these wires across a</span> <span m='913970'>spark gap, you know, a piece
  of metal here, a piece of metal here, and put them inside</span> <span
  m='919380'>a container, which has some gas. Like H2 or neon or whatever you
  want. But some simple</span> <span m='925230'>gas inside here.</span> <span
  m='928130'>So we've got an electric potential established across it. Again, we
  don't want so much potential</span> <span m='932339'>that it sparks, but we do
  want to excite the H2. So we can even make it spark, it doesn't</span> <span
  m='938070'>really matter too much. The important thing is that we're going to
  excite the hydrogen,</span> <span m='941730'>and in exciting the hydrogen the
  excited hydrogen is going to send out light. And then I'm going</span> <span
  m='948210'>to take this light-- we take the light, and I'm gonna shine this on
  a prism, something</span> <span m='956850'>I was taught to do by Newton. And--
  metaphorically speaking-- and look at the image of this light</span> <span
  m='965930'>having passed through the prism.</span> <span m='968610'>And what
  you find is you find a very distinct set of patterns. You do not get a
  continuous</span> <span m='974330'>band. In fact what you get-- I'm going to
  have a hard time drawing this so let me draw</span> <span m='977480'>down
  here. I'm now going to draw the intensity of the light incident on the screen
  on this</span> <span m='982740'>piece of paper-- people really used to use
  pieces of paper for this, which is kind of</span> <span m='987600'>awesome--
  as a function of the wavelength, and I'll measure it in angstroms.</span>
  <span m='990300'>And what you discover is-- here's around 1,000 angstroms--
  you get a bunch of lines. Get</span> <span m='999690'>these spikes. And they
  start to spread out, and then there aren't so many. And then at</span> <span
  m='1003860'>around 3,000, you get another set. And then at around 10,000, you
  get another set.</span> <span m='1021120'>This is around 10,000.</span> <span
  m='1026819'>And here's the interesting thing about these. So the discovery of
  these lines-- these are</span> <span m='1030220'>named after a guy named
  Lyman, these are-- these are named after a guy named-- Ballmer.</span> <span
  m='1039020'>Thank you. Steve Ballmer. And these are passion, like passion
  fruit. So. Everyone needs a mnemonic,</span> <span m='1049400'>OK. And so
  these people identified these lines and explained various things about
  them.</span> <span m='1056679'>But here's an interesting fact. If you replace
  this nuclear power plant with a coal plant,</span> <span m='1059900'>it makes
  no difference. If you replace this prism by a different prism, it makes no
  difference</span> <span m='1063890'>to where the lines are. If you change this
  mechanism of exciting the hydrogen, it makes</span> <span m='1069670'>no
  difference. As long as it's hydrogen-- as long as it's hydrogen in here you
  get the</span> <span m='1072910'>same lines, mainly with different intensities
  depending upon how exactly you do the experiment.</span> <span m='1076190'>But
  you get the same position of the lines. And that's a really striking
  thing.</span> <span m='1082350'>Now if you use a different chemical, a
  different gas in here, like neon, you get a very different</span> <span
  m='1086790'>set of lines. And a very different effective color now when you
  eyeball this thing. So</span> <span m='1090900'>Ballmer, incidentally-- and I
  think this is actually why he got blamed for that particular</span> <span
  m='1098630'>series, although I don't know the history-- Ballmer noticed by
  being-- depending on which</span> <span m='1102929'>biography you read-- very
  clever or very obsessed that these guys, this particular set, could</span>
  <span m='1108500'>be-- they're wavelengths. If you wrote their wavelengths and
  labeled them by an integer</span> <span m='1111250'>n, where n ran from 3 to
  any positive integer above 3, could be written as 36. So this is</span> <span
  m='1117110'>pure numerology. 36, 46 angstroms times the function n squared
  over n squared minus 4,</span> <span m='1124020'>where N is equal to 3, 4, dot
  dot dot-- an integer.</span> <span m='1128679'>And it turns out if you just
  plug in these integers, you get a pretty good approximation</span> <span
  m='1131270'>to this series of lines. This is a hallowed tradition, a
  phenomenological fit to some</span> <span m='1138020'>data. Where did it come
  from? It came from his creative or obsessed mind. So this was</span> <span
  m='1142760'>Ballmer. And this is specifically for hydrogen gas, H2.</span>
  <span m='1150510'>So Rydberg and Ritz, R and R, said, well actually we can do
  one better. Now that they realized</span> <span m='1156750'>that this is true,
  they looked at the whole sequence. And they found a really neat little</span>
  <span m='1159720'>expression, which is that 1 over the wavelength is equal to
  a single constant parameter. Not</span> <span m='1164750'>just for all these,
  but for all of them. One single numerical coefficient times 1 over</span>
  <span m='1170559'>m squared minus 1 over n squared-- n is an integer greater
  than zero and greater in particular</span> <span m='1176460'>than m. And if
  you plug in any value of n and any value of m, for sufficiently
  reasonable--</span> <span m='1181450'>I mean, if you put in 10 million
  integers you're not going to see it because it's way</span> <span
  m='1183770'>out there, but if you put in or-- rather, in here-- if you put any
  value of n and m,</span> <span m='1192750'>you will get one of these lines. So
  again, why? You know, as it's said, who ordered that.</span> <span
  m='1203390'>So this is experimental result three that we're going to have to
  deal with. When you</span> <span m='1206030'>look at atoms and you look at the
  specter of light coming off of them, their spectra</span> <span
  m='1209530'>are discrete. But they're not just stupidly discrete, they're
  discrete with real structure.</span> <span m='1214799'>Something that begs for
  an explanation. This is obviously more than numerology, because</span> <span
  m='1219559'>it explains with one tunable coefficient a tremendous number of
  spectral lines. And there's</span> <span m='1225179'>a difference-- and
  crucially, these both work specifically for hydrogen. For different
  atoms</span> <span m='1229760'>you need a totally different formula.</span>
  <span m='1231450'>But again, there's always some formula that nails those
  spectral lines. Why? Questions?</span> <span m='1244740'>OK. So speaking of
  atomic spectra-- whoops, I went one too far-- here's a different
  experiment.</span> <span m='1260120'>So people notice the following thing.
  People notice that if you take a piece of metal and</span> <span
  m='1267470'>you shine a light at it, by taking the sun or better yet, you
  know, these days we'd use</span> <span m='1272660'>a laser, but you shine
  light on this piece of metal. Something that is done all the time</span> <span
  m='1277840'>in condensed matter labs, it's a very useful technique. We really
  do use lasers not the</span> <span m='1281640'>sun, but still it continues to
  be useful in fact to this day.</span> <span m='1284390'>You shine light on a
  piece of metal and every once in a while what happens is electrons</span>
  <span m='1287630'>come flying off. And the more light and the stronger the
  light you shine, you see changes</span> <span m='1295049'>in the way that
  electrons bounce off. So we'd like to measure that. I'd like to make
  that</span> <span m='1299920'>precise. And this was done in a really lovely
  experiment. Here's the experiment. The basic</span> <span m='1303429'>idea of
  the experiment is I want to check to see, as I change the features of the
  light,</span> <span m='1307510'>the intensity, the frequency, whatever, I want
  to see how that changes the properties</span> <span m='1310660'>of the
  electrons that bounce off.</span> <span m='1312059'>Now one obvious way-- one
  obvious feature of an electron that flew off a piece of metal</span> <span
  m='1315690'>is how fast is it going, how much energy does it have. What's its
  kinetic energy. So I'd</span> <span m='1319890'>like to build an experiment
  that measures the kinetic energy of an electron that's been</span> <span
  m='1323540'>excited through this photoelectric effect. Through emission after
  shining light on a</span> <span m='1329400'>piece of metal. Cool?</span> <span
  m='1330280'>So I want to build that experiment. So here's how that experiment
  goes. Well if this electron</span> <span m='1334590'>comes flying off with
  some kinetic energy and I want to measure that kinetic energy,</span> <span
  m='1340809'>imagine the following circuit. OK first off imagine I just take a
  second piece of metal</span> <span m='1346390'>over here, and I'm going to put
  a little current meter here, an ammeter. And here's what this</span> <span
  m='1353000'>circuit does. When you shine light on this piece of metal-- we'll
  put a screen to protect</span> <span m='1356370'>the other piece of metal--
  the electrons come flying off, they get over here. And now I've</span> <span
  m='1360020'>got a bunch of extra electrons over here and I'm missing electrons
  over here. So this is</span> <span m='1363230'>negative, this is positive. And
  the electrons will not flow along this wire back here to</span> <span
  m='1367170'>neutralize the system.</span> <span m='1368330'>The more light I
  shine, the more electrons will go through this circuit. And as a
  consequence,</span> <span m='1372870'>there will be a current running through
  this current meter. That cool with everyone? OK.</span> <span m='1378030'>So
  we haven't yet measured the kinetic energy, though. How do we measure the
  kinetic energy?</span> <span m='1381299'>I want to know how much energy, with
  how much energy, were these electrons ejected.</span> <span m='1384929'>Well I
  can do that by the following clever trick. I'm going to put now a voltage
  source</span> <span m='1390210'>here, which I can tune the voltage of, with
  the voltage V. And what that's going to do</span> <span m='1395370'>is set up
  a potential difference across these and the energy in that is the charge
  times</span> <span m='1399960'>the potential difference. So I know that the
  potential difference it takes, so the amount</span> <span m='1404770'>of
  energy it takes to overcome this potential difference, is q times V. That
  cool?</span> <span m='1411020'>So now imagine I send in an electron-- I send
  in light and it leads an electron to jump</span> <span m='1415990'>across, and
  it has kinetic energy, kE. Well if the kinetic energy is less than this,
  will</span> <span m='1421660'>it get across? Not so much. It'll just fall
  back. But if the kinetic energy is greater</span> <span m='1426320'>than the
  energy it takes to cross, it'll cross and induce a current.</span> <span
  m='1431360'>So the upshot is that, as a function of the voltage, what I should
  see is that there is</span> <span m='1438780'>some critical minimum voltage.
  And depending on how you set up the sign, the sign could</span> <span
  m='1444030'>be the other way, but there's some critical minimal voltage where,
  for less voltage, the</span> <span m='1451260'>electron doesn't get across.
  And for any greater voltage-- or, sorry, for any closer to zero</span> <span
  m='1458500'>voltage, the electron has enough kinetic energy to get across. And
  so the current should increase.</span> <span m='1464020'>So there's a critical
  voltage, V-critical, where the current running through the system</span> <span
  m='1468740'>runs to zero. You make it harder for the electrons by making the
  voltage in magnitude even larger.</span> <span m='1475030'>You make it harder
  for the electrons to get across. None will get across. Make it a little</span>
  <span m='1478390'>easier, more and more will get across. And the current will
  go up. So what you want to</span> <span m='1485470'>do to measure this kinetic
  energy is you want to measure the critical voltage at which the</span> <span
  m='1489830'>current goes to zero.</span> <span m='1497440'>So now the question
  is what do we expect to see. And remember that things we can tune</span> <span
  m='1501210'>in this experiment are the intensity of the light, which is like e
  squared plus b squared.</span> <span m='1508530'>And we can tune the frequency
  of the light. We can vary that. Now does the total energy,</span> <span
  m='1514130'>does that frequency show up in the total energy of a classical
  electromagnetic wave? No. If</span> <span m='1518919'>it's an electromagnetic
  wave, it cancels out. You just get the total intensity, which is</span> <span
  m='1525950'>a square of the fields. So this is just like a harmonic
  oscillator. The energy is in the</span> <span m='1533880'>amplitude. The
  frequency of the oscillator doesn't matter. You push the swing harder,</span>
  <span m='1536919'>it gets more kinetic energy. It's got more energy.
  OK.</span> <span m='1543440'>So what do we expect to see as we vary, for
  example, the intensity? So here's a natural</span> <span m='1548740'>gas. If
  you take-- so you can think about the light here as getting a person
  literally,</span> <span m='1553220'>like get the person next to you to take a
  bat and hit a piece of metal. If they hit</span> <span m='1557559'>it really
  lightly they're probably not going to excite electrons with a lot of
  energy.</span> <span m='1559970'>If they just whack the heck out of it, then
  it wouldn't be too surprising if you get much</span> <span m='1563840'>more
  energy in the particles that come flying off. Hit it hard enough, things are
  just gonna</span> <span m='1566860'>shrapnel and disintegrate.</span> <span
  m='1569980'>The expectation here is the following. That if you have a more
  intense beam, then you</span> <span m='1580910'>should get more-- the
  electrons coming off should be more energetic. Because you're hitting</span>
  <span m='1585510'>them harder. And remember that the potential, which I will
  call V0, the stopping voltage.</span> <span m='1597370'>So therefore V0 should
  be greater in magnitude.</span> <span m='1604230'>So this anticipates that the
  way this curve should look as we vary the current as a function</span> <span
  m='1609850'>of v, if we have a low voltage-- sorry, if we have a low-intensity
  beam-- it shouldn't</span> <span m='1617250'>take too much potential just to
  impede the motion.</span> <span m='1621990'>But if we have a-- so this is a
  low intensity.</span> <span m='1624880'>But if we have a high-intensity beam,
  it should take a really large voltage to impede the</span> <span
  m='1629960'>electric flow, the electric current, because high-intensity beam
  you're just whacking those</span> <span m='1634250'>electrons really hard and
  they're coming off with a lot of kinetic energy. So this is high</span> <span
  m='1639870'>intensity. Everyone down with that intuition? This is what you get
  from Maxwell's electrodynamics.</span> <span m='1648070'>This is what you'd
  expect.</span> <span m='1651990'>And in particular, as we vary-- so this is
  our predictions-- in particular as we vary--</span> <span m='1660660'>so this
  is 1, 2, with greater intensity. And the second prediction is that V-naught
  should</span> <span m='1670830'>be independent of frequency. Because the
  energy density and electromagnetic wave is independent</span> <span
  m='1675169'>of the frequency. It just depends on the amplitude. And I will use
  nu to denote the frequency.</span> <span m='1684600'>So those are the
  predictions that come from 8.02 and 8.03. But this is 8.04. And here's
  what</span> <span m='1695020'>the experimental results actually look like. So
  here's the intensity, here's the potential.</span> <span m='1701880'>And if we
  look at high potential, it turns out that-- if we look, sorry, if we look
  at</span> <span m='1706230'>intermediate potentials, it's true that the high
  intensity leads to a larger current and</span> <span m='1712770'>the low
  intensity leads to a lower current.</span> <span m='1716690'>But here's the
  funny thing that happens. As you go down to the critical voltage, their</span>
  <span m='1724330'>critical voltages are the same. What that tells you is that
  the kinetic energy kicked</span> <span m='1732440'>out-- or the kinetic energy
  of an electron kicked out of this piece of metal by the light</span> <span
  m='1737010'>is independent of how intense that beam is. No matter how intense
  that beam is, no matter</span> <span m='1743530'>how strong the light you
  shine on the material, the electrons all come out with the same energy.</span>
  <span m='1749120'>This would be like taking a baseball and hitting it with a
  really powerful swing or a really</span> <span m='1755600'>weak swing and
  seeing that the electron dribbles away with the same amount of energy.
  This</span> <span m='1759450'>is very counter-intuitive.</span> <span
  m='1765140'>But more surprisingly, V-naught is actually independent of
  intensity. But here's the real</span> <span m='1772690'>shocker. V-naught
  varies linearly in the frequency. What does change V-naught is changing
  the</span> <span m='1781770'>frequency of the light in this incident. That
  means that if you take an incredibly diffuse</span> <span m='1785960'>light--
  incredibly diffuse light, you can barely see it-- of a very high
  frequency,</span> <span m='1791090'>then it takes a lot of energy to impede
  the electrons that come popping off.</span> <span m='1796710'>The electrons
  that come popping off have a large energy. But if you take a
  low-frequency</span> <span m='1801900'>light with extremely high intensity,
  then those electrons are really easy to stop. Powerful</span> <span
  m='1807720'>beam but low frequency, it's easy to stop those electrons. Weak
  little tiny beam at</span> <span m='1811539'>high frequency, very hard to stop
  the electrons that do come off. So this is very counter-intuitive</span> <span
  m='1816530'>and it doesn't fit at all with the Maxwellian picture. Questions
  about that?</span> <span m='1823730'>So this led Einstein to make a
  prediction. This was his 1905 result. One of his many</span> <span
  m='1834340'>totally breathtaking papers of that year. And he didn't really
  propose a model or a</span> <span m='1838679'>detailed theoretical
  understanding of this, but he proposed a very simple idea. And he</span> <span
  m='1842720'>said, look, if you want to fit this-- if you want to fit this
  experiment with some simple</span> <span m='1847990'>equations, here's the way
  to explain it. I claim-- I here means Einstein, not me-- I</span> <span
  m='1853850'>claim that light comes in packets or chunks with definite energy.
  And the energy is linearly</span> <span m='1869539'>proportional to the
  frequency. And our energy is equal to something times nu, and we'll</span>
  <span m='1874120'>call the coefficient h.</span> <span m='1878780'>The
  intensity of light, or the amplitude squared, the intensity is like the number
  of packets.</span> <span m='1891820'>So if you have a more intense beam at the
  same frequency, the energy of each individual</span> <span m='1896580'>chunk
  of light is the same. There are just a lot more chunks flying around. And so
  to</span> <span m='1904070'>explain the photoelectric effect, Einstein
  observed the following. Look, he said, the</span> <span m='1908350'>electrons
  are stuck under the metal. And it takes some work to pull them off. So now
  what's</span> <span m='1912860'>the kinetic energy of an electron that comes
  flying off-- whoops, k3. Bart might have a</span> <span m='1919159'>laugh
  about that one. Kinetic, kE, not 3.</span> <span m='1923470'>So the kinetic
  energy of electron that comes flying off, well, it's the energy
  deposited</span> <span m='1927780'>by the photon, the chunk of light, h-nu
  well we have to subtract off the work it took.</span> <span m='1933580'>Minus
  the work to extract the electron from the material. And you can think of this
  as</span> <span m='1938070'>how much energy does it take to suck it off the
  surface. And the consequence of this is</span> <span m='1944820'>that the
  kinetic energy of an electron should be-- look, if h-nu is too small, if the
  frequency</span> <span m='1954809'>is too low, then the kinetic energy would
  be negative.</span> <span m='1957850'>But that doesn't make any sense. You
  can't have negative kinetic energy. It's a strictly</span> <span
  m='1961090'>positive quantity. So it just doesn't work until you have a
  critical value where the</span> <span m='1965679'>frequency times h-- this
  coefficient-- is equal to the work it takes to extract. And</span> <span
  m='1970460'>after that, the kinetic energy rises with the frequency with a
  slope equal to h. And</span> <span m='1975960'>that fits the data like a
  champ.</span> <span m='1984000'>So no matter-- let's think about what this is
  saying again. No matter what you do, if</span> <span m='1988650'>your light is
  very low-frequency and you pick some definite piece of metal that has a
  very</span> <span m='1993130'>definite work function, very definite amount of
  energy it takes to extract electrons from</span> <span m='1997049'>the
  surface. No matter how intense your beam, if the frequency is insufficiently
  high, no</span> <span m='2003610'>electrons come off. None.</span> <span
  m='2006799'>So it turns out none is maybe a little overstatement because what
  you can have is two photon processes,</span> <span m='2010840'>where two
  chunks hit one electron at the right, just at the same time. Roughly speaking
  the</span> <span m='2014309'>same time. And they have twice the energy, but
  you can imagine that the probability of</span> <span m='2017950'>two photon
  hitting one electron at the same time of pretty low. So the intensity has
  to</span> <span m='2021850'>be preposterously high. And you see those sorts of
  multi-photon effects. But as long</span> <span m='2025450'>as we're not
  talking about insanely high intensities, this is an absolutely fantastic probe
  of the</span> <span m='2032730'>physics.</span> <span m='2033450'>Now there's
  a whole long subsequent story in the development of quantum mechanics
  about</span> <span m='2037650'>this particular effect. And it turns out that
  the photoelectric effect is a little more</span> <span m='2040320'>complicated
  than this. But the story line is a very useful one for organizing your
  understanding</span> <span m='2047440'>of the photoelectric effect. And in
  particular, this relation that Einstein proposed out of</span> <span
  m='2052460'>the blue, with no other basis. No one else had ever seen this sort
  of statement that</span> <span m='2056940'>the electrons, or that the energy
  of a beam of light should be made up of some number</span> <span
  m='2062699'>of chunks, each of which has a definite minimum amount of
  energy.</span> <span m='2067909'>So you can take what you've learned from 8.02
  and 8.03 and extract a little bit more information</span> <span
  m='2073859'>out of this. So here's something you learned from 8.02. In 8.02
  you learned that the energy</span> <span m='2079639'>of an electromagnetic
  wave is equal to c times the momentum carried by that wave-- whoops,</span>
  <span m='2084239'>over two. And in 8.03 you should have learned that the
  wavelength of an electromagnetic</span> <span m='2091509'>wave times the
  frequency is equal to the speed of light, C.</span> <span m='2099099'>And we
  just had Einstein tell us-- or declare, without further evidence, just saying,
  look</span> <span m='2107539'>this fits-- that the energy of a chunk of light
  should be h times the frequency. So</span> <span m='2113809'>if you combine
  these together, you get another nice relation that's similar to this
  one,</span> <span m='2116960'>which says that the momentum of a chunk of light
  is equal to h over lambda. So these</span> <span m='2125269'>are two
  enormously influential expressions which come out of this argument from the
  photoelectric</span> <span m='2129789'>effect from Einstein. And they're going
  to be-- their legacy will be with us throughout</span> <span m='2133279'>the
  rest of the semester.</span> <span m='2136789'>Now this coefficient has a
  name, and it was named after Planck. It's called Planck's Constant.</span>
  <span m='2151989'>And the reason that it's called Planck's Constant has
  nothing to do with the photoelectric effect.</span> <span m='2155339'>It was
  first this idea that an electromagnetic wave, that light, has an energy which
  is linearly</span> <span m='2163489'>proportional not to its intensity
  squared, none of that, but just linearly proportional</span> <span
  m='2167469'>to the frequency. First came up an analysis of black body
  radiation by Planck. And you'll</span> <span m='2173339'>understand, you'll go
  through this in some detail in 8.044 later in the semester. So I'm</span>
  <span m='2176690'>not going to dwell on it now, but I do want to give you a
  little bit of perspective on it.</span> <span m='2180660'>So Planck ran across
  this idea that E is equal to h/nu. Through the process of trying to</span>
  <span m='2188710'>fit an experimental curve. There was a theory of how much
  energy should be emitted by an</span> <span m='2194829'>object that's hot and
  glowing as a function of frequency. And that theory turned out to</span> <span
  m='2199329'>be in total disagreement with experiment. Spectacular
  disagreement. The curve for the</span> <span m='2204019'>theory went up, the
  curve for the experiment went down. They were totally different.</span> <span
  m='2208109'>So Planck set about writing down a function that described the
  data. Literally curve-fitting,</span> <span m='2212819'>that's all he was
  doing. And this is the depths of desperation to which he was led, was
  curve-fitting.</span> <span m='2218069'>He's an adult. He shouldn't be doing
  this, but he was curve-fitting. And so he fits the</span> <span
  m='2222749'>curve, and in order to get it to fit the only thing that he can
  get to work even vaguely</span> <span m='2227339'>well is if he puts in this
  calculation of h/nu. He says, well, maybe when I sum over</span> <span
  m='2233299'>all the possible energies I should restrict the energies which
  were proportional to the</span> <span m='2237569'>frequency.</span> <span
  m='2240759'>And it was forced on him because it fit from the function. Just
  functional analysis. Hated</span> <span m='2244979'>it. Hated it, he
  completely hated it. He was really frustrated by this. It fit
  perfectly,</span> <span m='2250910'>he became very famous. He was already
  famous, but he became ridiculously famous. Just totally</span> <span
  m='2254950'>loathed this idea. OK. So it's now become a cornerstone of quantum
  mechanics. But he</span> <span m='2260539'>wasn't so happy about it.</span>
  <span m='2261549'>And to give you a sense for how bold and punchy this paper
  by Einstein was that said, look,</span> <span m='2266579'>seriously. Seriously
  guys. e equals h/nu. Here's what Planck had to say when he wrote</span> <span
  m='2272269'>a letter of recommendation to get Einstein into the Prussian
  Academy of Sciences in 1917,</span> <span m='2275910'>or 1913. So he said,
  there is hardly one among the great problems in physics to which
  Einstein</span> <span m='2281170'>has not made an important contribution. That
  he may sometimes have missed the target in</span> <span m='2285670'>his
  speculations as in his hypothesis of photons cannot really be held too much
  against him.</span> <span m='2291479'>It's not possible to introduce new ideas
  without occasionally taking a risk.</span> <span m='2298249'>Einstein who
  subsequently went on to develop special relativity and general
  relativity</span> <span m='2302680'>and prove the existence of atoms and the
  best measurement of Avogadro's Constant, subsequently</span> <span
  m='2308559'>got the Nobel Prize. Not for Avogadro's Constant, not for proving
  the existence of atoms, not</span> <span m='2313180'>for relativity, but for
  photons. Because of guys like Planck, right. This is crazy.</span> <span
  m='2319380'>So this was a pretty bold idea. And here, to get a sense for why--
  we're gonna leave</span> <span m='2325089'>that up because it's just sort of
  fun to see these guys scowling and smiling-- there is,</span> <span
  m='2331599'>incidentally there's a great book about Einstein's years in Berlin
  by Tom Levenson, who's a professor</span> <span m='2337339'>here. A great
  writer and a sort of historian of science. You should take a class from
  him,</span> <span m='2344539'>which is really great. But I encourage you to
  read this book. It talks about why Planck</span> <span m='2348549'>is not
  looking so pleased right there, among many other things. It's a great
  story.</span> <span m='2354650'>So let's step back for a second. Why was
  Planck so upset by this, and why was in fact everyone</span> <span
  m='2358630'>so flustered by this idea that it led to the best prize you can
  give a physicist. Apart</span> <span m='2364529'>from a happy home and, you
  know. I've got that one. That's the one that matters to me.</span> <span
  m='2376450'>So why is this so surprising? And the answer is really simple. We
  know that it's false.</span> <span m='2382529'>We know empirically, we've
  known for two hundred and some years that light is a wave. Empirically.</span>
  <span m='2387700'>This isn't like people are like, oh I think it'd be nice if
  it was a wave. It's a wave.</span> <span m='2392069'>So how do we know that?
  So this goes back to the double-slit experiment from Young.</span> <span
  m='2396799'>Young's performance of this was in 1803. Intimations of it come
  much earlier. But this is really</span> <span m='2404489'>where it hits nails
  to the wall. And here's the experiment.</span> <span m='2409609'>So how many
  people in here have not seen a double-slit experiment described? Yeah,
  exactly.</span> <span m='2415700'>OK. So I'm just going to quickly remind you
  of how this goes.</span> <span m='2418880'>So we have a source for waves. We
  let the waves get big until they're basically plane</span> <span
  m='2423339'>waves. And then we take a barrier. And we poke two slits in it.
  And these plane waves</span> <span m='2429459'>induce-- they act like sources
  at the slits and we get nu. And you get crests and troughs.</span> <span
  m='2435680'>And you look at some distant screen and you look at the pattern,
  and the pattern you get</span> <span m='2438579'>has a maximum. But then it
  falls off, and it has these wiggles, these interference fringes.</span> <span
  m='2445509'>These interference fringes are, of course, extremely important.
  And what's going on here</span> <span m='2449799'>is that the waves sometimes
  add in-- so the amplitude of the wave, the height of the wave,</span> <span
  m='2455579'>sometimes adds constructively and sometimes destructively. So that
  sometimes you get twice</span> <span m='2461160'>the height and sometimes you
  get nothing.</span> <span m='2466369'>So just because it's fun to see this,
  here's Young's actual diagram from his original note</span> <span
  m='2471859'>on the double-slit experiment. So a and b are the slits, and c, d
  and f are the [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m='2478640'>on the screen, the distant
  screen. He drew it by hand. It's pretty good.</span> <span m='2487690'>So
  we've known for a very long time that light, because of the double-slit
  experiment, light</span> <span m='2492039'>is clearly wavy, it behaves like a
  wave. And what are the senses in which it behaves like</span> <span
  m='2495119'>a wave? There are two important senses here. The first is answered
  by the question, where</span> <span m='2504940'>did the wave hit the screen?
  So when we send in a wave, you know, I drop a stone, one big</span> <span
  m='2515430'>pulsive wave comes out. It splits into-- it leads to new waves
  being instigated here and</span> <span m='2519900'>over here. Where did that
  wave hit the screen? Anyone?</span> <span m='2527700'>AUDIENCE:
  Everywhere.</span> <span m='2529040'>PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly. It didn't hit
  this wave-- the screen in any one spot. But some</span> <span
  m='2532259'>amplitude shows up everywhere. The wave is a distributed object,
  it does not exist at</span> <span m='2535890'>one spot, and it's by virtue of
  the fact that it is not a localized object-- it is not a</span> <span
  m='2540420'>point-like object-- that it can interfere with itself. The wave is
  a big large phenomena</span> <span m='2547910'>in a liquid, in some
  thing.</span> <span m='2551519'>So it's sort of essential that it's not a
  localized object. So not localized. The answer</span> <span m='2557299'>is not
  localized. And let's contrast this with what happens if you take this
  double-slit</span> <span m='2565569'>experiment and you do it with, you know,
  I don't know, take-- who. Hmm. Tim Wakefield.</span> <span m='2576120'>Let's
  give some love to that guy.</span> <span m='2577979'>So, baseball player. And
  have him throw baseballs at a screen with two slits in it. OK? Now</span>
  <span m='2583729'>he's got pretty good-- well, he's got terrible accuracy,
  actually. So every once in a while</span> <span m='2590650'>he'll make it
  through the slits. So let's imagine first blocking off-- what, he's a</span>
  <span m='2595150'>knuckle-baller, right-- so every once in a while it goes,
  the baseball will go through</span> <span m='2598670'>the slit.</span> <span
  m='2599930'>And let's think about what happens, so let's cover one slit. And
  what we expect to happen</span> <span m='2602719'>is, well, it'll go through
  more or less straight, but sometimes it'll scrape the edge, it'll</span> <span
  m='2606759'>go off to the side, and sometimes it'll come over here. But if you
  take a whole bunch of</span> <span m='2610769'>baseballs, and-- so any one
  baseball, where does it hit? Some spot. Right? One spot. Not</span> <span
  m='2619309'>distributed. One spot.</span> <span m='2620519'>And as a
  consequence, you know, one goes here, one goes there, one goes there. And now,
  there's</span> <span m='2624739'>nothing like interference effects, but what
  happens is as it sort of doesn't-- you get</span> <span m='2630059'>some
  distribution if you look at where they all hit. Yeah? Everyone cool with that?
  And</span> <span m='2634309'>if we had covered over this slot, or slit, and
  let the baseballs go through this one,</span> <span m='2639839'>same thing
  would have happened.</span> <span m='2640729'>Now if we leave them both open,
  what happens is sometimes it goes here, sometimes it goes</span> <span
  m='2644650'>here. So now it's pretty useful that we've got a knuckle-baller.
  And what you actually</span> <span m='2647670'>get is the total distribution
  looks like this. It's the sum of the two. But at any given</span> <span
  m='2652989'>time, any one baseball, you say, aha, the baseball either went
  through the top slit,</span> <span m='2656200'>and more or less goes up here.
  Or it went through the bottom slit and more or less goes</span> <span
  m='2658650'>down here. So for chunks-- so this is for waves-- for chunks or
  localized particles,</span> <span m='2668219'>they are localized. And as a
  consequence, we get no interference.</span> <span m='2683190'>So for waves,
  they are not localized, and we do get interference. Yes, interference.</span>
  <span m='2695509'>OK. So on your problem set, you're going to deal with some
  calculations involving these</span> <span m='2701849'>interference effects.
  And I'm going to brush over them.</span> <span m='2705509'>Anyway the point of
  the double-slit experiment is that whatever else you want to say about</span>
  <span m='2713599'>baseballs or anything else, light, as we've learned since
  1803 in Young's double-slit</span> <span m='2719769'>experiment, light behaves
  like a wave. It is not localized, it hits the screen over</span> <span
  m='2723569'>its entire extent. And as a consequence, we get interference. The
  amplitudes add. The</span> <span m='2728369'>intensity is the square of the
  amplitude. If the intensities add-- so sorry, if the</span> <span
  m='2734519'>amplitudes add-- amplitude total is equal to a1 plus a2, the
  intensity, which is the</span> <span m='2739559'>square of a1 plus a2 squared,
  has interference terms, the cross terms, from this square.</span> <span
  m='2757920'>So light, from this point of view, is an electromagnetic wave. It
  interferes with itself. It's made</span> <span m='2762900'>of chunks. And I
  can't help but think about it this way, this is literally the metaphor</span>
  <span m='2768700'>I use in my head-- light is creamy and smooth like a wave.
  Chunks are very different. But</span> <span m='2778160'>here's the funny
  thing. Light is both smooth like a wave, it is also chunky. It is super</span>
  <span m='2785089'>chunky, as we have learned from the photoelectric effect. So
  light is both at once. So it's</span> <span m='2791900'>the best of both
  worlds. Everyone will be satisfied, unless you're not from the US,</span>
  <span m='2796400'>in which case this is deeply disturbing. So of course the
  original Superchunk is a band.</span> <span m='2805400'>So we've learned now
  from Young that light is a wave. We've learned from the photoelectric</span>
  <span m='2809309'>effect that light is a bunch of chunks. OK. Most
  experimental results are true. So how</span> <span m='2818430'>does that work?
  Well, we're gonna have to deal with that.</span> <span m='2822759'>But enough
  about light. If this is true of light, if light, depending on what
  experiment</span> <span m='2827339'>you do and how you do the experiment,
  sometimes it seems like it's a wave, sometimes it seems</span> <span
  m='2830739'>like it's a chunk or particle, which is true? Which is the better
  description?</span> <span m='2837180'>So it's actually worthwhile to not think
  about light all the time. Let's think about something</span> <span
  m='2841739'>more general. Let's stick to electrons. So as we saw from
  yesterday's lecture, you probably</span> <span m='2847099'>want to be a little
  bit wary when thinking about individual electrons. Things could be</span>
  <span m='2850589'>a little bit different than your classical intuition. But
  here's a crucial thing. Before</span> <span m='2854999'>doing anything else,
  we can just think, which one of these two is more likely to describe</span>
  <span m='2858449'>electrons well.</span> <span m='2859799'>Well electrons are
  localized. When you throw an electron at a CRT, it does not hit the</span>
  <span m='2866190'>whole CRT with a wavy distribution. When you take a single
  electron and you throw it at</span> <span m='2869199'>a CRT, it goes ping and
  there's a little glowing spot. Electrons are localized. And we know</span>
  <span m='2874699'>that localized things don't lead to interference.</span>
  <span m='2882940'>Some guys at Hitachi, really good scientists and engineers,
  developed some really awesome</span> <span m='2886279'>technology a couple of
  decades ago. They were trying to figure out a good way to demonstrate</span>
  <span m='2890019'>their technology. And they decided that you know what would
  be really awesome, this thought</span> <span m='2893680'>experiment that
  people have always talked about that's never been done really well,</span>
  <span m='2896579'>of sending an electron through a two-slitted experiment. In
  this case it was like ten slits</span> <span m='2900499'>effectively, it was a
  grading. Send an electron, a bunch of electrons, one at a time, throw</span>
  <span m='2904910'>the electron, wait. Throw the electron, wait. Like our
  French guy with the boat.</span> <span m='2908529'>So do this experiment with
  our technology and let's see what happens. And this really</span> <span
  m='2914349'>is one of my favorite-- let's see, how we close these screens--
  aha. OK. This is going</span> <span m='2922269'>to take a little bit of-- and
  it's broken. No, no. Oh that's so sad.</span> <span m='2930180'>AUDIENCE:
  [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='2937620'>PROFESSOR: Come on. I'm just gonna let--
  let's see if we can, we'll get part of the way.</span> <span m='2947440'>I
  don't want to destroy it. So what they actually did is they said, look,
  let's-- we want to</span> <span m='2951729'>see what happens. We want to
  actually do this experiment because we're so awesome at Hitachi</span> <span
  m='2955839'>Research Labs, so let's do it. So here's what they did. And I'm
  going to turn off the light.</span> <span m='2962289'>And I set this to some
  music because I like it.</span> <span m='2969599'>OK here's what's happening.
  One at a time, individual photons.</span> <span m='2977529'>[MUSIC
  PLAYING]</span> <span m='2995280'>PROFESSOR: So they look pretty localized.
  There's not a whole lot of structure. Now</span> <span m='3005979'>they're
  going to start speeding it up. It's 100 times the actual speed.</span> <span
  m='3013400'>[MUSIC PLAYING]</span> <span m='3041240'>PROFESSOR: Eh?
  Yeah.</span> <span m='3043540'>AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]</span> <span
  m='3049280'>PROFESSOR: So those guys know what they're doing. Let's-- there
  were go. So I think I</span> <span m='3055589'>don't know of a more vivid
  example of electron interference than that one. It's totally obvious.</span>
  <span m='3060509'>You see individual electrons. They run through the
  apparatus. You wait, they run through</span> <span m='3064069'>the apparatus.
  You wait. One at a time, single electron, like a baseball being pitched
  through</span> <span m='3068529'>two slits, and what you see is an
  interference effect. But you don't see the interference</span> <span
  m='3072660'>effect like you do from light, from waves on the sea.</span> <span
  m='3076400'>You see the interference effect by looking at the cumulative
  stacking up of all the electrons</span> <span m='3080079'>as they hit. Look at
  where all the electrons hit one at a time. So is an electron behaving</span>
  <span m='3085680'>like a wave in a pond? No. Does a wave in a pond at a spot?
  No. It's a distributed beast.</span> <span m='3095339'>OK yes, it interferes,
  but it's not localized. Well is it behaving like a baseball? Well</span> <span
  m='3100650'>it's localized.</span> <span m='3101969'>But on-- when I look at a
  whole bunch of electrons, they do that. They seem to interfere, but</span>
  <span m='3107440'>there's only one electron going through at a time. So in
  some sense it's interfering</span> <span m='3110079'>with itself. How does
  that work? Is an electron a wave?</span> <span m='3114239'>AUDIENCE:
  Yes.</span> <span m='3116569'>PROFESSOR: Does an electron hit at many spots at
  once?</span> <span m='3120130'>AUDIENCE: No.</span> <span
  m='3120880'>PROFESSOR: No. So is an electron a wave. No. Is an electron a
  baseball? No. It's an electron.</span> <span m='3128920'>So this is something
  you're going to have to deal with, that every once in awhile we</span> <span
  m='3134029'>have these wonderful moments where it's useful to think about an
  electron as behaving in</span> <span m='3137150'>a wave-like sense. Sometimes
  it's useful to think about it as behaving in a particle-like</span> <span
  m='3141699'>sense. But it is not a particle like you normally conceive of a
  baseball. And it is not a wave</span> <span m='3145630'>like you normally
  conceive of a wave on the surface of a pond. It's an electron.</span> <span
  m='3155680'>I like to think about this like an elephant. If you're closing
  your eyes and you walk up</span> <span m='3161229'>to an elephant, you might
  think like I've got a snake and I've got a tree trunk and,</span> <span
  m='3164670'>you know, there's a fan over here. And you wouldn't know, like,
  maybe it's a wave, maybe</span> <span m='3168739'>it's a particle, I can't
  really tell. But if you could just see the thing the way it</span> <span
  m='3172650'>is, not through the preconceived sort of notions you have, you'd
  see it's an elephant. Yes,</span> <span m='3177569'>that is the Stata Center.
  So-- look, everything has to happen sometime, right?</span> <span
  m='3183709'>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='3186780'>PROFESSOR: So
  Heisenberg-- it's often, people often give the false impression in
  popular</span> <span m='3192609'>books on physics, so I want to subvert this,
  that in the early days of quantum mechanics,</span> <span m='3196369'>the
  early people like Born and Oppenheimer and Heisenberg who invented quantum
  mechanics,</span> <span m='3203609'>they were really tortured about, you know,
  is it an electron, is it a wave. It's a wave-particle</span> <span
  m='3206880'>duality. It's both. And this is one of the best subversions of
  that sort of silliness</span> <span m='3211740'>that I know of.</span> <span
  m='3212319'>And so what Heisenberg says, the two mental pictures which
  experiments lead us to form,</span> <span m='3216019'>the one of particles the
  other waves, are both incomplete and have the validity of analogies,</span>
  <span m='3221259'>which are accurate only in limited cases. The apparent
  duality rises in the limitation</span> <span m='3226099'>of our language. And
  then he goes on to say, look, you developed your intuition by throwing</span>
  <span m='3230390'>rocks and, you know, swimming. And, duh, that's not going to
  be very good for atoms.</span> <span m='3236239'>So this will be posted, it's
  really wonderful. His whole lecture is really-- the lectures</span> <span
  m='3241609'>are really quite lovely. And by the way, that's him in the middle
  there, Pauley all the way</span> <span m='3245440'>on the right. I guess they
  were pleased. OK so that's the Hitachi thing.</span> <span m='3252279'>So now
  let's pick up on this, though. Let's pick up on this and think about what
  happens.</span> <span m='3259539'>I want to think in a little more detail
  about this Hitachi experiment. And I want to think</span> <span
  m='3263599'>about it in the context of a simple two-slit experiment. So here's
  our source of electrons.</span> <span m='3268099'>It's literally a gun, an
  electron gun. And it's firing off electrons. And here's our</span> <span
  m='3271690'>barrier, and it has two slits in it.</span> <span m='3277259'>And
  we know that any individual electron hits its own spot. But when we take many
  of them,</span> <span m='3284049'>we get an interference effect. We get
  interference fringes. And so the number that hit a given</span> <span
  m='3288380'>spot fill up, construct this distribution. So then here's the
  question I want to ask.</span> <span m='3297390'>When I take a single
  electron, I shoot one electron at a time through this experiment,</span> <span
  m='3301839'>one electron. It could go through the top slit, it could go
  through the bottom slit.</span> <span m='3306430'>While it's inside the
  apparatus, which path does it take?</span> <span m='3312960'>AUDIENCE:
  Superposition.</span> <span m='3315920'>PROFESSOR: Good. So did it take the
  top path?</span> <span m='3317939'>AUDIENCE: No.</span> <span
  m='3318799'>PROFESSOR: How do you know?</span> <span m='3320249'>[INTERPOSING
  VOICES]</span> <span m='3323400'>PROFESSOR: Good, let's block the bottom, OK,
  to force it to go through the top slit. So</span> <span m='3328959'>we'll
  block the bottom slit. Now the only electrons that make it through go
  through</span> <span m='3332619'>the top slit. Half of them don't make it
  through. But those that do make it through give you</span> <span
  m='3337839'>this distribution. No interference. But I didn't tell you these
  are hundreds of thousands</span> <span m='3343390'>of kilometers apart, the
  person who threw in the electron didn't know whether there</span> <span
  m='3347430'>was a barrier here. The electron, how could it possibly know
  whether there was a barrier</span> <span m='3350599'>here if you went through
  the top.</span> <span m='3352089'>This is exactly like our boxes. It's exactly
  like our box. Did it go through-- an electron,</span> <span m='3357719'>when
  the slits are both open and we know that ensemble average it will give us an
  interference</span> <span m='3363229'>effect, did the electron inside the
  apparatus go through the top path? No. Did it go through</span> <span
  m='3368329'>the bottom path? Did it go through both? Because we only see one
  electron. Did it go through</span> <span m='3373489'>neither? It is in
  a--</span> <span m='3374969'>AUDIENCE: Superposition.</span> <span
  m='3376360'>PROFESSOR: --of having gone through the top and the bottom. Of
  being along the top half</span> <span m='3379150'>and being along the bottom
  path. This is a classic example of the two-box experiment.</span> <span
  m='3385519'>OK. So you want to tie that together.</span> <span m='3394529'>So
  let's nuance this just a little bit, though, because it's going to have an
  interesting</span> <span m='3397779'>implication for gravity. So here's the
  nuance I want to pull on this one. Let's cheat. OK.</span> <span
  m='3407650'>Suppose I want to measure which slit the electron actually did go
  through. How might I do that?</span> <span m='3413939'>Well I could do the
  course thing I've been doing which is I could block it and just catch</span>
  <span m='3417630'>the-- catch electrons that go through in that spot. But
  that's a little heavy-handed. Probably</span> <span m='3422420'>I can do
  something a little more delicate.</span> <span m='3423529'>And so here's the
  more delicate thing I'm going to do. I want to build a detector that</span>
  <span m='3431979'>uses very, very, very weak light, extremely weak light, to
  detect whether the particle</span> <span m='3437259'>went through here or
  here. And the way I can do that is I can sort of shine light through</span>
  <span m='3440920'>and-- I'm gonna, you know, bounce-- so here's my source of
  light. And I'll be able to tell</span> <span m='3447380'>whether the electron
  went through this slit or it went through this slit. Cool?</span> <span
  m='3451779'>So imagine I did that. So obviously I don't want to use some
  giant, huge, ultra high-energy</span> <span m='3458479'>laser because it would
  just blast the thing out of the way. It would destroy the experiment.</span>
  <span m='3461279'>So I wanna something very diffuse, very low energy, very low
  intensity electromagnetic</span> <span m='3465979'>wave. And the idea here is
  that, OK, it's true that when I bounce this light off an</span> <span
  m='3471209'>electron, let's say it bounces off an electron here, it's true
  it's going impart some momentum</span> <span m='3476439'>and the electron's
  gonna change its course. But if it's really, really weak, low energy</span>
  <span m='3480079'>light, then it's-- it's gonna deflect only a little tiny
  bit.</span> <span m='3483199'>So it will change the pattern I get over here.
  But it will change it in some relatively minor</span> <span m='3488569'>way
  because I've just thrown in very, very low energy light. Yeah? That make
  sense? So</span> <span m='3493749'>this is the experiment I want to do. This
  experiment doesn't work. Why.</span> <span m='3504320'>AUDIENCE: You know
  which slit it went through.</span> <span m='3507180'>PROFESSOR: No. It's true
  that it turns out that those are correlated facts, but here's</span> <span
  m='3511109'>the problem. I can run this experiment without anyone actually
  knowing what happens until</span> <span m='3516089'>long afterwards. So
  knowing doesn't seem to play any role in it. It's very tempting often</span>
  <span m='3522170'>to say, no, but it turns out that it's really not about what
  you know. It's really just</span> <span m='3526170'>about the experiment
  you're doing.</span> <span m='3527499'>So what principle that we've already
  run into today makes it impossible to make this work?</span> <span
  m='3533140'>If I want to shine really low-energy, really diffuse light
  through, and have it scatter</span> <span m='3538269'>weakly. Yeah.</span>
  <span m='3541580'>AUDIENCE: Um, light is chunky.</span> <span
  m='3545400'>PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly. That's exactly right. So when I say
  really low-energy light, I don't--</span> <span m='3550670'>I really can't
  mean, because we've already done this experiment, I cannot possibly
  mean</span> <span m='3554549'>low intensity. Because intensity doesn't control
  the energy imparted by the light. The thing</span> <span m='3560499'>that
  controls the energy imparted by a collision of the light with the electron is
  the frequency.</span> <span m='3565079'>The energy in a chunk of light is
  proportional to the frequency.</span> <span m='3568999'>So now if I want to
  make the effect the energy or the momentum, similarly-- the momentum,</span>
  <span m='3573499'>where did it go-- remember the momentum goes like h over
  lambda. If I want to make the</span> <span m='3579229'>energy really low, I
  need to make the frequency really low. Or if I want to make the
  momentum</span> <span m='3582079'>really low, I need to make the wavelength
  what? Really big. Right? So in order to make</span> <span m='3587369'>the
  momentum imparted by this photon really low, I need to make the wavelength
  really</span> <span m='3591489'>long.</span> <span m='3592089'>But now here's
  the problem. If I make the wavelength really long, so if I use a really</span>
  <span m='3598299'>long-wavelengthed wave, like this long of a wavelength, are
  you ever going to be able</span> <span m='3603380'>to tell which slit it went
  through? No, because the particle could have been anywhere. It</span> <span
  m='3607369'>could have scattered this light if it was here, if it was here, if
  it was here, right?</span> <span m='3610739'>In order to measure where the
  electron is to some reasonable precision-- so, for example,</span> <span
  m='3615569'>to this sort of wavelength, I need to be able to send in light
  with a wavelength that's</span> <span m='3619599'>comparable to the scale that
  I want to measure. And it turns out that if you run through and</span> <span
  m='3625479'>just do the calculation, suppose I send in-- and this is done in
  the books, in I think</span> <span m='3630589'>all four, but this is done in
  the books on the reading list-- if you send in a wave with</span> <span
  m='3637029'>a short enough wavelength to be able to distinguish between these
  two slits, which slit did it</span> <span m='3641719'>go through, the momentum
  that it imparts precisely watches-- washes out is just enough to wash</span>
  <span m='3647309'>out the interference effect, and break up these fringes so
  you don't see interference</span> <span m='3652509'>effects.</span> <span
  m='3655229'>It's not about what you know. It's about the particulate nature of
  light and the fact that</span> <span m='3659880'>the momentum of a chunk of
  light goes like h over lambda. OK? But this tells you something</span> <span
  m='3666880'>really interesting. Did I have to use light to do this
  measurement? I could have sent</span> <span m='3673979'>in anything, right? I
  didn't have to bounce light off these things.</span> <span m='3677650'>I could
  have bounced off gravitational waves. So if I had a gravitational wave
  detector,</span> <span m='3684519'>so-- Matt works on gravitational wave
  detectors, and so, I didn't tell you this but Matt gave</span> <span
  m='3689939'>me a pretty killer gravitational wave detector. It's, you know,
  here it is. There's my awesome</span> <span m='3694420'>gravitational wave
  detector. And I'm now going to build supernova. OK.</span> <span
  m='3698130'>And they are creeping under this black hole, and it's going to
  create giant gravitational</span> <span m='3700519'>waves. And we're gonna use
  those gravitational waves and detect them with the super advanced</span> <span
  m='3704369'>LIGO. And I'm gonna detect which slit it went through. But
  gravitational waves, those aren't</span> <span m='3708859'>photons. So I
  really can make a low-intensity gravitational wave, and then I can tell
  which</span> <span m='3712670'>slit it went through without destroying the
  interference effect. That would be awesome.</span> <span m='3719429'>What does
  that tell you about gravitational waves? They must come in chunks. In
  order</span> <span m='3725699'>for this all to fit together logically, you
  need all the interactions that you could scatter</span> <span m='3729679'>off
  this to satisfy these quantization properties. But the energy is proportional
  to the frequency.</span> <span m='3735029'>The line I just gave you is a
  heuristic. And making it precise is one of the great challenges</span> <span
  m='3738979'>of modern contemporary high-energy physics, of dealing with the
  quantum mechanics and</span> <span m='3743890'>gravity together.</span> <span
  m='3744839'>But this gives you a strong picture of why we need to treat all
  forces in all interactions</span> <span m='3750140'>quantum-mechanically in
  order for the world to be consistent. OK. Good. OK, questions</span> <span
  m='3759589'>at this point? OK. So-- oh, I forgot about this one-- so there are
  actually two more.</span> <span m='3771679'>So I want to just quickly show
  you-- well, OK.</span> <span m='3775029'>So, this is a gorgeous experiment. So
  remember I told you the story of the guy with the boat</span> <span
  m='3779549'>and the opaque wall and it turns out that's a cheat. It turns out
  that this opaque screen</span> <span m='3785029'>doesn't actually give you
  quantum mechanically isolated photons. They're still, in a very</span> <span
  m='3791939'>important way, classical. So this experiment was done truly with a
  source that gives you</span> <span m='3797179'>quantum mechanically isolated
  single photons, one at a time.</span> <span m='3800359'>So this is the
  analogue of the Hitachi experiment. And it was done by this pretty awesome
  Japanese</span> <span m='3806759'>group some number of years ago. And I just
  want to emphasize that it gives you exactly</span> <span m='3810599'>the same
  effects. We see that photons-- this should look essentially identical to
  what</span> <span m='3814519'>we saw at the end of the Hitachi video. And
  that's because it's exactly the same physics.</span> <span m='3817920'>It's a
  grating with something like 10 slits and individual particles going through
  one</span> <span m='3822369'>at a time and hitting the screen and going,
  bing.</span> <span m='3825788'>So what you see is the light going, bing, on a
  CCD. It's a pretty spectacular experience.</span> <span m='3833949'>So let's
  get back to electrons. I want another probe of whether electrons are really
  waves</span> <span m='3838509'>or not. So this other experiment-- again,
  you're going to study this on your problem</span> <span m='3843390'>set-- this
  other experiment was done by a couple of characters named Davisson and
  Germer.</span> <span m='3851259'>And in this experiment, what they did is they
  took a crystal, and a crystal is just a lattice</span> <span m='3855840'>of
  regularly-located ions, like diamond or something. Yeah?</span> <span
  m='3865600'>AUDIENCE: Before you go on I guess,</span> <span m='3867540'>I
  wanted to ask if the probability of a photon or an electron going through the
  10 slits is about the same?</span> <span m='3873900'>PROFESSOR: Is what,
  sorry?</span> <span m='3875560'>AUDIENCE: Is exactly the same.</span> <span
  m='3876839'>PROFESSOR: You mean for different electrons?</span> <span
  m='3878549'>AUDIENCE: Yeah.</span> <span m='3878839'>PROFESSOR: Well they can
  be different if the initial conditions are different. But they</span> <span
  m='3882069'>could be-- if the initial conditions are the same, then the
  probabilities are identical.</span> <span m='3886599'>So every electron
  behaves identically to every other electron in that sense. Is that what</span>
  <span m='3890380'>you were asking?</span> <span m='3891380'>AUDIENCE: It is
  actually like through any [INAUDIBLE] the probability of it going like
  [INAUDIBLE]?</span> <span m='3898140'>PROFESSOR: Sure, absolutely. So the
  issue there is just a technological one of trying</span> <span m='3902219'>to
  build a beam that's perfectly columnated. And that's just not doable. So
  there's always</span> <span m='3907049'>some dispersion in your beam. So in
  practice it's very hard to make them identical, but</span> <span
  m='3911880'>in principle they could be if you were infinitely powerful as an
  experimentalist, which-- again,</span> <span m='3916939'>I was banned from the
  lab, so not me.</span> <span m='3919910'>So here's our crystal. You could
  think of this as diamond or nickel or whatever. I think</span> <span
  m='3923469'>they actually use nickel but I don't remember exactly. And they
  sent in a beam of electrons.</span> <span m='3932140'>So they send in a beam
  of electrons, and what they discover is that if you send in these</span> <span
  m='3938299'>electrons and watch how they scatter at various different angles--
  I'm going to call the angle</span> <span m='3944390'>here of scattering
  theta-- what they discover is that the intensity of the reflected beam,</span>
  <span m='3954059'>as a function of theta, shows interference effects.</span>
  <span m='3963099'>And in particular they gave a whole calculation for this,
  which I'm not going to go through</span> <span m='3966059'>right now because
  it's not terribly germane for us-- you're going to go through it on</span>
  <span m='3969640'>your problem set, so that'll be good and it's a perfect
  thing for your recitation instructors</span> <span m='3972679'>to go through.
  But the important thing is the upshot. So if the distance between these</span>
  <span m='3977660'>crystal planes is L-- or, sorry, d-- let me call it d. If
  the distance between the crystal</span> <span m='3984630'>planes is d, what
  they discover is that the interference effects that they observed,
  these</span> <span m='3991059'>maxima and minima, are consistent with the
  wavelength of light. Or, sorry, with the electrons</span> <span
  m='4000429'>behaving as if they were waves with a definite wavelength, with a
  wavelength lambda being</span> <span m='4006288'>equal to some integer, n,
  over 2d sine theta.</span> <span m='4016239'>So this is the data-- these are
  the data they actually saw, data are plural. And these are</span> <span
  m='4021449'>the data they actually saw. And they infer from this that the
  electrons are behaving</span> <span m='4026049'>as if they were wave-like with
  this wavelength. And what they actually see are individual</span> <span
  m='4031079'>electrons hitting one by one. Although in their experiment, they
  couldn't resolve individual</span> <span m='4033839'>electrons. But that is
  what they see.</span> <span m='4035799'>And so in particular, plugging all of
  this back into the experiment, you send in the</span> <span
  m='4041538'>electrons with some energy, which corresponds to some definite
  momentum. This leads us back</span> <span m='4044660'>to the same expression
  as before, that the momentum is equal to h over lambda, with this</span> <span
  m='4049809'>lambda associated. So it turns out that this is correct.</span>
  <span m='4055229'>So the electrons diffract off the crystal as if they have a
  momentum which comes with</span> <span m='4060420'>a definite wavelength
  corresponding to its momentum. So that's experimental result--</span> <span
  m='4068759'>oh, I forgot to check off four-- that's experimental result five,
  that electrons diffract. We already</span> <span m='4073999'>saw the electron
  diffraction.</span> <span m='4077959'>So something to emphasize is that-- so
  these experiments as we've described them were done</span> <span
  m='4084150'>with photons and with electrons, but you can imagine doing the
  experiments with soccer</span> <span m='4089559'>balls. This is of course
  hard. Quantum effects for macroscopic objects are usually
  insignificantly</span> <span m='4094390'>small. However, this experiment was
  done with Buckyballs, which are the same shape as soccer</span> <span
  m='4099830'>balls in some sense. But they're huge, they're gigantic objects.
  So here's the experiment</span> <span m='4106189'>in which this was actually
  done. So these guys are just totally amazing. So this is</span> <span
  m='4111819'>Zellinger's lab. And it doesn't look like all-- I mean it looks
  kind of, you know. It's</span> <span m='4118580'>hideous, right? I mean to a
  theorist it's like, come on, you've got to be kidding that</span> <span
  m='4121420'>that's--</span> <span m='4122710'>But here's what a theorist is
  happy about. You know, because it looks simple. We really</span> <span
  m='4127640'>love lying to ourselves about that. So here's an over. We're going
  to cook up some Buckyballs</span> <span m='4132318'>and emit them with some
  definite known thermal energy. Known to some accuracy. We're going</span>
  <span m='4137000'>to columnate them by sending them through a single slit, and
  then we're going to send</span> <span m='4139830'>them through a diffraction
  grating which, again, is just a whole bunch of slits.</span> <span
  m='4143000'>And then we're going to image them using photo ionization and see
  where they pop through.</span> <span m='4149818'>So here is the horizontal
  position of this wave along the grating, and this is the number</span> <span
  m='4156559'>that come through. This is literally one by one counts because
  they're going bing, bing,</span> <span m='4160660'>bing, as a c60 molecule
  goes through. So without the grating, you just get a peek. But with</span>
  <span m='4165479'>the grating, you get the side bands. You get interference
  fringes.</span> <span m='4169540'>So these guys, again, they're going through
  one by one. A single Buckyball, 60 carbons,</span> <span m='4176910'>going
  through one by one is interfering with itself. This is a gigantic object by
  any sort</span> <span m='4181479'>of comparison to single electrons. And we're
  seeing these interference fringes.</span> <span m='4187899'>So this is a
  pretty tour de force experiment, but I just want to emphasize that if you
  could</span> <span m='4191160'>do this with your neighbor, it would work.
  You'd just have to isolate the system well</span> <span m='4195910'>enough.
  And that's a technological challenge but not an in-principle one.</span> <span
  m='4202559'>OK. So we have one last experimental facts to deal with. And this
  is Bell's Inequality,</span> <span m='4216460'>and this is my favorite one. So
  Bell's Inequality for many years languished in obscurity until</span> <span
  m='4224940'>someone realized that it could actually be done beautifully in an
  experiment that led</span> <span m='4228960'>to a very concrete experiment
  that they could actually do and that they wanted to do.</span> <span
  m='4232309'>And we now think of it as an enormously influential idea which
  nails the coffin closed for classical</span> <span m='4239460'>mechanics. And
  it starts with a very simple question. I claim that the following
  inequality</span> <span m='4246110'>is true: the number of undergraduate-- of
  the number of people in the room who are undergraduates,</span> <span
  m='4254720'>which I'll denote as U-- and not blonde, which I will denote as
  bar B-- so undergraduates</span> <span m='4260350'>who are not blonde--
  actually let me write this out in English. It's gonna be easier.</span> <span
  m='4264840'>Number who are undergrads and not blonde plus the number of people
  in the room who are blonde</span> <span m='4278530'>but not from Massachusetts
  is strictly greater than or equal to the number of people in the</span> <span
  m='4287980'>room who are undergraduates and not from Massachusetts.</span>
  <span m='4296960'>I claim that this is true. I haven't checked</span> <span
  m='4299960'>in this room. But I claim that this is true.</span> <span
  m='4301860'>So let's check. How many people are undergraduates who are not
  blonde? OK this is going to--</span> <span m='4307860'>jeez. OK that's-- so,
  lots. OK. How many people are blonde but not from Massachusetts? OK.</span>
  <span m='4316110'>A smattering. Oh God, this is actually going to be
  terrible.</span> <span m='4321860'>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]</span> <span
  m='4331870'>PROFESSOR: Shoot. This is a really large class. OK. Small. And how
  many people are undergraduates</span> <span m='4341559'>who are not from
  Massachusetts? Yeah, this-- oh God. This counting is going to be-- so</span>
  <span m='4345520'>let's-- I'm going to do this just so I can do the counting
  with the first two rows here.</span> <span m='4348600'>OK. My life is going to
  be easier this way.</span> <span m='4350710'>So how many people in the first
  two rows, in the center section, are undergraduates</span> <span
  m='4354270'>but not blonde? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,
  nine, ten, eleven, twelve,</span> <span m='4360550'>thirteen, fourteen. We
  could dispute some of those, but we'll take it for the moment.</span> <span
  m='4365790'>So, fourteen. You're probably all undergraduates. So blonde and
  not from Massachusetts. One.</span> <span m='4372110'>Awesome. Undergraduates
  not from Massachusetts. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,</span>
  <span m='4381180'>nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.
  Equality.</span> <span m='4387460'>AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]</span> <span
  m='4389030'>PROFESSOR: OK. So that-- you might say well, look, you should have
  been nervous there.</span> <span m='4395150'>You know, and admittedly
  sometimes there's experimental error. But I want to convince</span> <span
  m='4399809'>you that I should never, ever ever be nervous about this moment in
  8.04. And the reason is</span> <span m='4405620'>the following. I want to
  prove this for you. And the way I'm gonna prove it is slightly</span> <span
  m='4408630'>more general, in more generality. And I want to prove to you that
  the number-- if I have</span> <span m='4413000'>a set, or, sorry, if the
  number of people who are undergraduates and not blonde which,</span> <span
  m='4417059'>all right, is b bar plus the number who are blonde but not from
  Massachusetts is greater</span> <span m='4423250'>than or equal to the number
  that are undergraduates and not from Massachusetts.</span> <span
  m='4428840'>So how do I prove this? Well if you're an undergraduate and not
  blonde, you may or you</span> <span m='4434040'>may not be from Massachusetts.
  So this is equal to the number of undergraduates who</span> <span
  m='4438540'>are not blonde and are from Massachusetts plus the number of
  undergraduates who are</span> <span m='4443750'>not blonde and are not from
  Massachusetts. It could hardly be otherwise. You either are</span> <span
  m='4449920'>or you are not from Massachusetts. Not the sort of thing that you
  normally see in physics.</span> <span m='4455690'>So this is the number of
  people who are blonde and not from Massachusetts, number of people</span>
  <span m='4459460'>who are blonde, who are-- so if you're blonde and not from
  Massachusetts, you may or may</span> <span m='4463570'>not be an
  undergraduate. So this is the number of people who are undergraduates,
  blonde,</span> <span m='4467300'>and not from Massachusetts plus the number of
  people who are not undergraduates, are</span> <span m='4472350'>blonde and are
  not from Massachusetts.</span> <span m='4476040'>And on the right hand side--
  so, adding these two together gives us plus and plus. On the</span> <span
  m='4482330'>right hand side, the number of people that are undergraduates and
  not from Massachusetts,</span> <span m='4485080'>well each one could be either
  blonde or not blonde. So this is equal to the number that</span> <span
  m='4489720'>are undergraduates, blonde, and not from Massachusetts,</span>
  <span m='4493520'>plus-- remember that our undergraduates not</span> <span
  m='4496750'>blonde and not from Massachusetts. Agreed?</span> <span
  m='4500440'>I am now going to use the awesome power of-- and so this is what
  we want to prove, and</span> <span m='4505460'>I'm going to use the awesome
  power of subtraction. And note that U, B, M bar, these guys cancel.</span>
  <span m='4512150'>And U, B bar, M bar, these guys cancel. And we're left with
  the following proposition:</span> <span m='4519380'>the number of
  undergraduates who are not blonde but are from Massachusetts plus the
  number</span> <span m='4523750'>of undergrad-- of non-undergraduates who are
  blonde but not from Massachusetts must be</span> <span m='4527809'>greater
  than or equal to zero.</span> <span m='4531570'>Can you have a number of
  people in a room satisfying some condition be less than zero?</span> <span
  m='4537800'>Can minus 3 of you be blonde undergraduates not from
  Massachusetts? Not so much. This</span> <span m='4544260'>is a strictly
  positive number, because it's a numerative. It's a counting problem.
  How</span> <span m='4547570'>many are undergraduates not blonde and from
  Massachusetts. Yeah? Everyone cool with that?</span> <span m='4553230'>So it
  could hardly have been otherwise. It had to work out like this.</span> <span
  m='4556090'>And here's the more general statement. The more general statement
  is that the number</span> <span m='4561670'>of people, or the number of
  elements of any set where each element in that set has binary</span> <span
  m='4566410'>properties a b and c-- a or not a, b or not b, c or not c.
  Satisfies the following inequality.</span> <span m='4572780'>The number who
  are a but not b plus the number who are b but not c is greater than or
  equal</span> <span m='4579450'>to the number who are a but not c. And this is
  exactly the same argument.</span> <span m='4587160'>And this inequality which
  is a tautology, really, is called Bell's Inequality. And it's</span> <span
  m='4595020'>obviously true. What did I use to derive this? Logic and integers,
  right? I mean, that's</span> <span m='4603190'>bedrock stuff.</span> <span
  m='4606520'>Here's the problem. I didn't mention this last time, but in fact
  electrons have a third</span> <span m='4613390'>property in addition to--
  electrons have a third property in addition to hardness and</span> <span
  m='4618830'>color. The third property is called whimsy, and you can either be
  whimsical or not whimsical.</span> <span m='4625080'>And every electron, when
  measured, is either whimsical or not whimsical. You never have</span> <span
  m='4628270'>a boring electron. You never have an ambiguous electron. Always
  whimsical or not whimsical.</span> <span m='4634580'>So we have hardness, we
  have color, we have whimsy. OK. And I can perform the following</span> <span
  m='4640800'>experiment. From a set of electrons, I can measure the number that
  are hard and not black,</span> <span m='4651030'>plus the number that are
  black but not whimsical. And I can measure the number that are hard</span>
  <span m='4660960'>and not whimsical. OK?</span> <span m='4665520'>And I want
  to just open up the case a little bit and tell you that the hardness here
  really</span> <span m='4670460'>is the angular momentum of the electron along
  the x-axis. Color is the angular momentum</span> <span m='4676380'>of the
  electron along the y-axis. And whimsy is the angular momentum of the electron
  along</span> <span m='4681210'>the z-axis. These are things I can measure
  because I can measure angular momentum.</span> <span m='4685830'>So I can
  perform this experiment with electrons and it needn't be satisfied. In
  particular,</span> <span m='4696559'>we will show that the number of
  electrons, just to be very precise, the number of electrons</span> <span
  m='4704080'>in a given set, which have positive angular momentum along the
  x-axis and down along the</span> <span m='4710470'>y-axis, plus up along the
  y-axis and down along the z-axis, is less than the number</span> <span
  m='4718520'>that are up. Actually let me do this in a very particular way.
  Up... zero down at theta.</span> <span m='4726610'>Up at theta, down at-- two
  theta is greater than the number that are up at zero and down at theta.</span>
  <span m='4733790'>Now here's the thing-- two theta. You can't at the moment
  understand what this equation</span> <span m='4739130'>means. But if I just
  tell you that these are three binary properties of the electron, OK,</span>
  <span m='4746030'>and that it violates this inequality, there is something
  deeply troubling about this result.</span> <span m='4751850'>Bell's
  Inequality, which we proved-- trivially, using integers, using logic-- is
  false in</span> <span m='4758770'>quantum mechanics.</span> <span
  m='4759830'>And it's not just false in quantum mechanics. We will at the end
  of the course derive the</span> <span m='4763800'>quantum mechanical
  prediction for this result and show that at least to a predicted
  violation</span> <span m='4767460'>of Bell's Inequality. This experiment has
  been done, and the real world violates Bell's</span> <span
  m='4773870'>Inequality. Logic and integers and adding probabilities, as we
  have done, is misguided.</span> <span m='4779880'>And our job, which we will
  begin with the next lecture, is to find a better way to add</span> <span
  m='4784460'>probabilities than classically. And that will be quantum mechanics
  See you on Tuesday.</span> <span m='4789980'>AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]</span> </p>
