  <p>Experimental set-up: First we split the beam, then we send one beam through
  the potential and the other along a free path of the same length, then we
  interfere the two beams to compare the phase. (Image courtesy of Allan

This course covers the experimental basis of quantum physics. It introduces wave mechanics, Schrödinger's equation in a single dimension, and Schrödinger's equation in three dimensions.

It is the first course in the undergraduate Quantum Physics sequence, followed by [_8.05 Quantum Physics II_](./resolveuid/321148ee9b67a132b916bb5cdd90dd86) and [_8.06 Quantum Physics III_](./resolveuid/f1d2dbc7185330a6c9331d338a201c12).
