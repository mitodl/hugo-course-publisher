transcript: >-
  <p><span m='10426'>>> Sally: Hey Dude, how are you?</span> </p><p><span
  m='13056'>>> Dude: I'm not doing too well.</span> </p><p><span m='14886'>I'm
  trying to figure which device to use to turn off the gas-o-matic module</span>
  <span m='18496'>and stop Buddy from growing too big.</span> </p><p><span
  m='20856'>But I don't know how to choose!</span> </p><p><span m='23256'>>>
  Sally: Hmm, well choosing the right device for your system can be pretty
  hard.</span> </p><p><span m='28466'>Why don't we work on this together?</span>
  </p><p><span m='30686'>>> Dude: That would be great.</span> </p><p><span
  m='32506'>I am just going around in circles here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='35366'>>> Sally: Well I'd suggest that you use a digital device</span>
  <span m='38346'>to turn off the gas-o-matic module when Buddy got to a certain
  size.</span> </p><p><span m='42696'>>> Dude: What's that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='43946'>>> Sally: Well let's start with the basics, all digital devices have
  inputs and outputs</span> <span m='49726'>that are always in one of two
  states: either ON or OFF.</span> </p><p><span m='54946'>People who work with
  electrical devices sometimes call the two states HIGH</span> <span
  m='59116'>and LOW because of the high or low voltages that the devices receive
  or produce.</span> </p><p><span m='64586'>Other people think of the two states
  as true/false or as the numbers 1 and 0.</span> </p><p><span m='70136'>It
  really doesn't matter.</span> </p><p><span m='71545'>What's important for us
  is that if you hook up the output of a digital device</span> <span
  m='75256'>to the gas-o-matic, when the device produces a high signal, Buddy
  will inflate.</span> </p><p><span m='80226'>When the device produces a low
  signal, Buddy will stop inflating</span> <span m='84015'>and he'll just stay
  the same size for a while.</span> </p><p><span m='86596'>>> Dude: That's cool
  but why make just two states?</span> </p><p><span m='89036'>Wouldn't it be
  cooler to make buddy get bigger really fast at first and then slowed</span>
  <span m='92726'>down when he's close to full size?</span> </p><p><span
  m='94836'>I really don't want to see him growing out of control like
  before.</span> </p><p><span m='98015'>Couldn't we build an even more
  interesting system from devices</span> <span m='100666'>with more states, like
  three or even ten?</span> </p><p><span m='103816'>>> Sally: Those are all
  really interesting ideas but here's why two states makes the most
  sense.</span> </p><p><span m='109426'>Let's imagine that you're measuring the
  output signal from your digital device over time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='115076'>Depending on what the input to the digital device is, the output
  will switch</span> <span m='119196'>between its two possible states ON and
  OFF.</span> </p><p><span m='123176'>But of course, this drawing is actually a
  bit misleading.</span> </p><p><span m='127316'>See all digital devices,
  whether they are genetic devices or electrical devices,</span> <span
  m='132196'>never produce a signal that is perfectly ON or perfectly OFF like
  I've drawn here.</span> </p><p><span m='137776'>There are always some minor
  fluctuations in the signal.</span> </p><p><span m='141476'>These fluctuations
  aren't real changes in state of course.</span> </p><p><span m='144716'>But
  sometimes, if the fluctuations are too big, then they might tell the
  gas-o-matic</span> <span m='149336'>to switch on when you really want it
  off.</span> </p><p><span m='152516'>>> Dude: Oh no.</span> </p><p><span
  m='153406'>I definitely don't want that.</span> </p><p><span m='154916'>It
  took forever to clean up the lab last time that happened.</span> </p><p><span
  m='158246'>So the reason we limit the devices to two states is because they
  work better when there's noise?</span> </p><p><span m='163376'>>> Sally:
  Exactly!</span> </p><p><span m='165006'>>> Dude: And you think Buddy's growth
  is noisy?</span> </p><p><span m='167256'>>> Sally: Definitely!</span>
  </p><p><span m='167996'>He changes a little just when he breathes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='170506'>And he can grow and shrink a lot depending on how much
  food he has and what's around him.</span> </p><p><span m='175776'>And
  sometimes I think he changes size just to show off...</span> </p><p><span
  m='179686'>>> Dude: So it sounds like digital devices are the way to
  go!</span> </p><p><span m='182876'>It will tell the gas-o-matic device to turn
  on if Buddy's really growing and turn off</span> <span m='187236'>if he's full
  size, but ignore those in between size fluctuations he likes</span> <span
  m='191326'>to make...but how big are the fluctuations that the device will
  ignore?</span> </p><p><span m='196456'>How does it know?</span> </p><p><span
  m='198826'>>> Sally: Well the device only knows what we tell it,</span> <span
  m='201836'>and we can split up ON and OFF the way we choose.</span>
  </p><p><span m='204976'>>> Dude: OK then...I'll put the ON/OFF border
  here!</span> </p><p><span m='209026'>>> Sally: Dude, weren't you
  listening!</span> </p><p><span m='211076'>If the signal is somewhere near this
  boundary and noisy, then the device will from switch</span> <span
  m='215746'>ON to OFF or OFF to ON when you don't want it to.</span>
  </p><p><span m='219396'>Here's what we can do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='220296'>Let's call just this small part the "valid" signals</span> <span
  m='223526'>and leave all this in between as "invalid" signals.</span>
  </p><p><span m='227226'>That way the device won't confuse ON signal values
  with OFF signal values so easily.</span> </p><p><span m='233386'>>> Dude: Aw
  Sally.</span> </p><p><span m='234856'>Maybe I'm not getting this at
  all.</span> </p><p><span m='236746'>It looks like you just put in two
  boundaries and now you've got twice as much trouble.</span> </p><p><span
  m='241076'>What's to stop the noise from switching between valid and invalid
  signals here AND here?</span> </p><p><span m='246286'>>> Sally: Dude, I
  actually think you've got the hang of this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='249806'>Here's the trick that engineers use: make the valid output ranges
  smaller than the input!</span> </p><p><span m='255826'>This way the quality of
  the output signal is always better than the quality</span> <span m='260036'>of
  the input signal and even if there is noise on the input, the digital device
  will get rid</span> <span m='265426'>of it but producing a better output
  signal.</span> </p><p><span m='268656'>This trick even has a name: Engineers
  call the difference between the valid input</span> <span m='273196'>and output
  ranges the noise margin.</span> </p><p><span m='276316'>>> Dude: Noise
  margins.</span> </p><p><span m='277516'>I like it!</span> </p><p><span
  m='279516'>Digital devices sound wicked useful.</span> </p><p><span
  m='281946'>But can we really build them out of DNA?</span> </p><p><span
  m='284776'>>> Sally: Some have already been built I can show you how they
  work</span> <span m='287726'>in some cells I've got growing in the lab.</span>
  </p><p><span m='290066'>The DNA device you want may be there already and ready
  to go.</span> </p><p><span m='294216'>Do you have some time to come to the lab
  now?</span> </p><p><span m='296696'>>> Dude: Can I answer in digital?</span>
