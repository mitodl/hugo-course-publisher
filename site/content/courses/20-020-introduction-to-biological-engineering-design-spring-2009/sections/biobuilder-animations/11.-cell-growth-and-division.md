title: 11. Bacterial Growth and its Measurement
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='9246'>Sally: This is Systems Sally.</span> </p><p><span
  m='11996'>Dude: Hey Sally.</span> </p><p><span m='12706'>It's Dude.</span>
  </p><p><span m='13456'>Sally: Dude, are you OK?</span> </p><p><span
  m='15206'>You sound out of breath.</span> </p><p><span m='16576'>Dude: Well I
  started growing some bacterial cells with Izzy last night,</span> <span
  m='19276'>and today I had to get to practice but coach kept us late and now
  I'm worried that the cells.</span> </p><p><span m='23296'>Sally: Dude?</span>
  </p><p><span m='24456'>You still there?</span> </p><p><span m='25566'>The
  cells what?</span> </p><p><span m='27426'>Dude Well I guess I don't really
  know.</span> </p><p><span m='29156'>Izzy said dog phase but that seems
  wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='32235'>Sally: Izzy probably said log phase which
  is</span> <span m='34786'>when the cells are actively growing and
  dividing.</span> </p><p><span m='37436'>If you have some bacteria growing, I'm
  happy to put the cultures on ice.</span> </p><p><span m='41146'>That will slow
  down their growth, and you can measure their density when you get here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='44716'>Dude: Thanks Sally!</span> </p><p><span m='45866'>Last
  night we put two flasks at room temperature and two in the 37 degrees
  incubator.</span> </p><p><span m='50476'>I'll be there as fast as I
  can.</span> </p><p><span m='55966'>Izzy: Hi Sally.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56796'>Have you seen Dude?</span> </p><p><span m='57576'>Sally: He just
  called to say he's on his way.</span> </p><p><span m='59496'>I'm putting these
  cultures on ice, but look: the ones that were</span> <span m='62306'>at room
  temperature don't seem to have grown much.</span> </p><p><span m='64646'>Izzy:
  I was a little afraid of that.</span> </p><p><span m='66036'>They carry a
  high-copy protein generator that Dude and I made,</span> <span m='69166'>but
  the growth of the cells takes a real hit when they carry this plasmid.</span>
  </p><p><span m='72666'>We've seen them spend 12 hours in lag phase and then
  take two days to reach stationary phase.</span> </p><p><span m='77536'>Without
  the plasmid, it's more like 4 hours to go from lag</span> <span m='80566'>to
  log and they're saturated overnight.</span> </p><p><span m='82556'>Sally: When
  did you start these growing?</span> </p><p><span m='84196'>Izzy: About 8:00
  last night we diluted the strain 1:1000.</span> </p><p><span m='87366'>And I
  don't think these have grown much since then, but I'll measure their density
  anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='91515'>Sally: The cells that were growing at 37
  degrees look a little more dense.</span> </p><p><span m='95196'>Maybe they're
  doubling at an almost normal rate.</span> </p><p><span m='97906'>Izzy:
  Yup.</span> </p><p><span m='98346'>Their density has definitely changed since
  yesterday and if Dude gets here fast,</span> <span m='102646'>we might be able
  to catch them in log phase and transform in a control device.</span>
  </p><p><span m='106306'>Sally: You might also want to count the cells since
  some</span> <span m='108566'>of the light scattering you're measuring</span>
  <span m='109946'>at the spectrophotometer could be coming from cell
  debris.</span> </p><p><span m='112526'>Izzy: I hadn't thought about that, but
  you're right.</span> </p><p><span m='114926'>I'll teach Dude to count cells
  when he gets here Sally: One other thing that I've seen happen is</span> <span
  m='118636'>for the cells to lose a plasmid if it's making them sick.</span>
  </p><p><span m='121616'>You and Dude might want to check that the cells are
  still resistant</span> <span m='124536'>to whatever antibiotic marker you have
  on the plasmid.</span> </p><p><span m='127126'>Dude: Hi Sally!</span>
  </p><p><span m='128076'>Hi Izzy! Sorry to be late.</span> </p><p><span
  m='129955'>I hope you've left me some things to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131776'>Izzy: In lab there's always plenty to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='133646'>Let's get started figuring out what's going on Dude: Getting here,
  I saw the most amazing pack</span> <span m='138586'>of dogs getting walked
  over the bridge.</span> </p>
