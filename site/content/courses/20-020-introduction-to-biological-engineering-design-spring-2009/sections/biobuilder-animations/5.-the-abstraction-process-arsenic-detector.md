  <p><span m='8266'>>> Sally: Hey Dude, look who's here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='9516'>It's my friend Izzy the iGEMer.</span> </p><p><span m='11886'>She
  just stopped by for a visit.</span> </p><p><span m='13606'>>> Dude:
  Whoa!</span> </p><p><span m='13976'>I've never met a real iGEMer
  before!</span> </p><p><span m='16206'>>> Izzy: Hey Dude, great to meet
  you.</span> </p><p><span m='18226'>>> Sally: I need to split some cells in the
  tissue culture room,</span> <span m='21396'>but I thought that you and Izzy
  could chat.</span> </p><p><span m='23186'>Maybe she could tell you a bit about
  her project?</span> </p><p><span m='26016'>>> Dude: Awesome!</span>
  </p><p><span m='27686'>>> Dude: So what was your iGEM project?</span>
  </p><p><span m='30076'>>> Izzy: Well we tried to engineer a bacterial arsenic
  detector.</span> </p><p><span m='33486'>>> Dude: A what?</span> </p><p><span
  m='34366'>>> Izzy: A bacterial cell that could tell us when arsenic is present
  in water.</span> </p><p><span m='38436'>>> Izzy: See arsenic contamination in
  drinking water is a big problem</span> <span m='42486'>for people living in
  Bangladesh and West Bengal.</span> </p><p><span m='45176'>And since there's no
  easy way to know if arsenic is in the water,</span> <span m='49106'>people
  there have been drinking contaminated water and getting sick .</span>
  </p><p><span m='53006'>So we wanted to engineer a biological system</span>
  <span m='56116'>that people can use to test their water for arsenic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='59016'>>> Dude: I had no idea this was such a problem!</span>
  </p><p><span m='61006'>What a great project to work on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='62525'>How does your system work?</span> </p><p><span m='63686'>>> Izzy:
  Well our goal or the system specification as engineers call it was</span>
  <span m='68636'>to have people mix a little of their drinking water, with a
  culture of bacteria and know</span> <span m='73896'>that there's arsenic
  contamination if the liquid changes color.</span> </p><p><span m='77146'>>>
  Dude: Awesome!.</span> </p><p><span m='78146'>But how did you get a bacteria
  to do that?</span> </p><p><span m='80386'>I'm still trying to figure how to
  make my bacterial balloon work!</span> </p><p><span m='83286'>>> Izzy: Well
  like all engineers, we used abstraction to help us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='86776'>Let's take a look.</span> </p><p><span m='87956'>>> Izzy: We knew we
  needed to build a system that could take as input arsenic</span> <span
  m='91696'>and produce as output a change in the color.</span> </p><p><span
  m='93926'>>> Izzy: So first, we compiled our system into devices.</span>
  </p><p><span m='97336'>We needed one device that could detect arsenic and
  produce a signal.</span> </p><p><span m='101856'>We called this our arsenic
  sensor and gave it a part number, BBA J33201.</span> </p><p><span
  m='110056'>And we needed a second device that could produce a color when it
  got the signal</span> <span m='114966'>from our arsenic sensor that there's
  arsenic around.</span> </p><p><span m='118515'>We called this color reporter
  BBA J33202.</span> </p><p><span m='123506'>>> Dude: I don't get it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='124636'>Why are you using two devices?</span> </p><p><span
  m='126376'>Wouldn't it be way easier to make just one: arsenic in and color
  out?</span> </p><p><span m='129606'>>> Izzy: Well you could do it that
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='132946'>But then the only thing that the device
  could be used for is to report</span> <span m='135496'>on arsenic
  contamination with color.</span> </p><p><span m='137416'>By splitting the
  system into two devices, a sensor and a reporter,</span> <span m='141516'>we
  hope future iGEM teams can use one or the other for new projects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='145426'>>> Dude: How?</span> </p><p><span m='146256'>>> Sally:
  Well a team could connect the arsenic sensor device to a different reporter
  device</span> <span m='151246'>that say, produces light instead of
  color.</span> </p><p><span m='153836'>Or a team could build a new system that
  detects say, mercury contamination,</span> <span m='157856'>and then produces
  a color as a response.</span> </p><p><span m='160876'>>> Izzy: Yep, we
  designed our system</span> <span m='162766'>so that people can more easily
  reuse and build on our work!</span> </p><p><span m='166746'>>> Dude: Oh I get
  it!</span> </p><p><span m='168196'>Maybe I could connect your arsenic sensor
  device to my balloon-making device!</span> </p><p><span m='172406'>>> Izzy:
  Exactly!</span> </p><p><span m='173886'>>> Dude: But shouldn't I know a little
  more</span> <span m='175216'>about how the arsenic sensor works before I just
  hook it up to by balloon making device?</span> </p><p><span m='179836'>Sally
  got kinda upset last time I didn't' stop the balloons from growing and
  growing...</span> </p><p><span m='185066'>>> Izzy: That's why we entered both
  devices into the Registry of Standard Biological Parts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='190176'>We also documented our project online at the iGEM wiki to make it
  easier</span> <span m='193296'>for others to build upon our work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='194516'>>> Sally: The goal is that eventually, for each device
  in the Registry,</span> <span m='197596'>there will be a datasheet available
  that summarizes all the relevant information</span> <span m='201376'>about
  that device so that you know how to use it</span> <span m='204016'>in a higher
  level system like the arsenic detector.</span> </p><p><span m='207106'>>>
  Dude: You mean just like this old datasheet I found for this a 7404 hex
  inverter chip?</span> </p><p><span m='211596'>>> Sally: Yep.</span>
  </p><p><span m='212055'>But I'm afraid there's still a lot of work to do
  before all the parts</span> <span m='215356'>and devices in the Registry have
  datasheets.</span> </p><p><span m='218055'>>> Dude: Great!</span> </p><p><span
  m='218896'>Lots of work to do.</span> </p><p><span m='220736'>Let's get
  started!</span> </p>
