  <p>Green light, go. Red light, stop. A transcriptional inverter may not work
  as fast as a traffic light, but Izzy helps Dude understand how this type of
  device can help him solve Buddy&rsquo;s overgrowth.</p>

transcript: >-
  <p><span m='9446'>>> Izzy: Dude, I like what you built there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='11646'>What's it do?</span> </p><p><span m='12416'>>> Dude:
  Oh...hi Iz.</span> </p><p><span m='14936'>This is a cool bug.</span>
  </p><p><span m='16736'>I made it using an electronics building kit that Sally
  got me.</span> </p><p><span m='20476'>She wanted to get me a genetics kit but
  nothing's available yet.</span> </p><p><span m='23916'>Eesh! I don't get
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='25806'>Why is it so easy to turn on and off the
  lights for this electronic bug but so hard</span> <span m='30266'>to turn
  things on and off in biology?</span> </p><p><span m='32746'>>> Izzy: What do
  you mean Dude?</span> </p><p><span m='34286'>The arsenic sensor that we built
  in bacteria a few years ago works pretty well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='38886'>If there's arsenic in the water being tested the sensor turns
  on.</span> </p><p><span m='43206'>And when arsenic isn't in the water, the
  sensor is off.</span> </p><p><span m='46446'>And we built that sensor with
  natural biological parts!</span> </p><p><span m='49796'>>> Dude: So arsenic
  works like this switch?</span> </p><p><span m='51976'>How is that
  possible?</span> </p><p><span m='53436'>How does the cell know?</span>
  </p><p><span m='55416'>>> Izzy: We used parts from the ArsR operon to program
  arsenic-inducible expression.</span> </p><p><span m='60126'>>> Dude: Hold
  up!</span> </p><p><span m='61316'>Arsenic-inducible expression?</span>
  </p><p><span m='63886'>What's that mean??</span> </p><p><span m='65256'>All I
  know is that arsenic is toxic.</span> </p><p><span m='68386'>Don't the cells
  just die when you poison them?</span> </p><p><span m='71276'>>> Izzy: Cells
  have come up with a bunch of clever ways to survive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='74656'>In the case of arsenic, the cells make a pump to get the
  poison</span> <span m='77896'>out as soon as any comes inside the cell.</span>
  </p><p><span m='80386'>>> Dude: That makes sense.</span> </p><p><span
  m='81015'>So ass-er is the pump?</span> </p><p><span m='82246'>And why did you
  call it inducible?</span> </p><p><span m='83706'>>> Izzy: Dude, be careful how
  you say it: the protein is called ArsR</span> <span m='87456'>since it's the
  ARSenic Repressor protein.</span> </p><p><span m='90196'>And ArsR isn't the
  pump.</span> </p><p><span m='92326'>It just tells the cell when to make the
  pump.</span> </p><p><span m='95166'>The operon has promoter, which is where
  the cell's RNA polymerase binds.</span> </p><p><span m='100446'>And at least
  three genes: the ArsR gene, which encodes the repressor protein, the ArsB
  gene,</span> <span m='107426'>which encodes the pump, and the ArsC gene, which
  encodes an enzyme that reduces arsenic</span> <span m='113416'>in the cell so
  it can be pumped out.</span> </p><p><span m='118566'>Most of the time, the
  operon is turned "off"</span> <span m='124406'>since the ArsR protein binds
  the DNA near the promoter to stop transcription.</span> </p><p><span
  m='129816'>But when arsenic comes into the cell, it binds the ArsR
  protein.</span> </p><p><span m='134806'>And when the repressor is bound to
  arsenic, it can't bind the DNA so RNA polymerase can.</span> </p><p><span
  m='141066'>That way the cell makes more of the repressor, the pump,</span>
  <span m='144466'>and the enzyme only when there's arsenic around.</span>
  </p><p><span m='147366'>That's the inducible part.</span> </p><p><span
  m='149616'>>> Dude: So why did you include the whole operon in your arsenic
  sensor?</span> </p><p><span m='152866'>It seems like you could just include
  the ArsR gene</span> <span m='155296'>and the promoter parts for your arsenic
  sensor device?</span> </p><p><span m='158116'>>> Izzy: Nice work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='159336'>That's actually exactly what we did.</span>
  </p><p><span m='161596'>We simplified the natural system to only use the parts
  we wanted.</span> </p><p><span m='165586'>So it looks like this...</span>
  </p><p><span m='168046'>>> Dude: So you're arsenic sensor works like
  this?</span> </p><p><span m='171476'>>> Izzy: Dude, that's great but I have
  two even simpler way to write it.</span> </p><p><span m='174936'>This is
  called a truth table and this is called a transfer curve.</span> </p><p><span
  m='179356'>Both tell you that when arsenic levels are low, the operon is
  mostly off</span> <span m='183966'>and when arsenic levels are high, the
  operon turns on and starts cranking out proteins.</span> </p><p><span
  m='192506'>Earth to Dude...what are you doing?</span> </p><p><span
  m='195656'>>> Dude: Well here's the thing Iz.</span> </p><p><span
  m='197446'>I'm always looking for some way to get Buddy's gas-o-matic
  module</span> <span m='200516'>to turn off before he gets too big.</span>
  </p><p><span m='202536'>I was hoping I could maybe switch this operon around
  to get the truth table working like this.</span> </p><p><span m='208246'>And
  get the transfer curve looking like this.</span> </p><p><span m='211416'>>>
  Izzy: No problem!</span> </p><p><span m='212296'>You're looking for a simple
  digital device called an inverter.</span> </p><p><span m='216066'>>> Dude:
  Oe-kaaay.</span> </p><p><span m='218146'>Can we turn this operon into an
  inverter or do I have to build something completely different?</span>
  </p><p><span m='223276'>>> Izzy: There are already a few transcription-based
  inverters in the registry,</span> <span m='226776'>but I don't know if
  anyone's built one using the arsenic repressor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='231326'>Maybe you can be the first.</span> </p><p><span m='232776'>Do you
  want to try?</span> </p><p><span m='234096'>>> Dude: You bet!!</span>
  </p><p><span m='235376'>But how?? What about this idea: lets take this
  promoter that binds the "Ars R" protein</span> <span m='241986'>and move it to
  the end of the operon.</span> </p><p><span m='244206'>This way if I put my
  gas-o-matic device after the promoter, then high production</span> <span
  m='248766'>of the arsenic operon gives low production of the gas-o-matic
  device.</span> </p><p><span m='252626'>Input 1 Output 0...I think I nailed
  it!</span> </p><p><span m='258446'>>> Izzy: Nice thinking Dude.</span>
  </p><p><span m='259726'>Most of the Registry's transcriptional inverters are
  of that form: DNA that encodes the repressor</span> <span m='265866'>and then
  a promoter that's repressed by it.</span> </p><p><span m='268786'>One thing to
  remember about transcriptional inverters is that they're pretty slow to
  switch.</span> </p><p><span m='274156'>It can take over an hour for the
  inverter to change its output signal</span> <span m='278326'>after it receives
  a change in input signal.</span> </p><p><span m='281126'>>> Dude: Well that
  might be ok.</span> </p><p><span m='282616'>It's not like Buddy grows super
  fast.</span> </p><p><span m='284866'>>> Izzy: Well then maybe for your
  application a transcriptional inverter is just fine,</span> <span
  m='289926'>or maybe the registry has one that will work better.</span>
  </p><p><span m='292726'>>> Dude: Registry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='294686'>Search Parts .Inverter.</span> </p><p><span m='298706'>I like this
  number: Q04401.</span> </p><p><span m='302646'>Hmm that's strange.</span>
  </p><p><span m='306646'>The Registry says that BBa_Q04401 works</span> <span
  m='312756'>but the transfer curve doesn't look like what you've drawn.</span>
  </p><p><span m='315086'>>> Izzy: Well, the transfer curve that I drew is a
  perfect inverter transfer curve.</span> </p><p><span m='321526'>But when you
  actually build the devices, they aren't going to have perfect behavior.</span>
  </p><p><span m='325086'>And that's as true in electrical engineering and
  biological engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='330486'>Devices won't switch
  from high to low as sharply as what I've drawn.</span> </p><p><span
  m='334276'>>> Dude: I'd really like a sharper change than this though.</span>
  </p><p><span m='337626'>Maybe I should just build the ArsR inverter to try in
  Buddy?</span> </p><p><span m='340976'>>> Izzy: I think it would be worth a
  shot ...let's get the parts you'll need</span> <span m='344236'>and we can
  start today...</span> </p>
