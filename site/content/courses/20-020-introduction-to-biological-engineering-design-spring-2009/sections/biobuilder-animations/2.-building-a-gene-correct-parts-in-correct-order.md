transcript: >-
  <p><span m='8176'>>> Dude: Grrr!</span> </p><p><span m='9306'>Something is
  really wrong with this!</span> </p><p><span m='11586'>>> Sally: What are you
  playing with?</span> </p><p><span m='12916'>>> Dude: I downloaded an app
  called "Part Palette."</span> <span m='15126'>It lets me plan genetic circuits
  using Parts from the Registry.</span> </p><p><span m='18526'>>> Sally: That
  sounds great.</span> </p><p><span m='19476'>Can I see?</span> </p><p><span
  m='19996'>>> Dude: I can select parts and then wrap them together on the
  palette.</span> </p><p><span m='22926'>Or at least I'm suppose to be able to
  do that!</span> </p><p><span m='24406'>>> Sally: Hmmm...</span> </p><p><span
  m='24866'>I keep getting an error message.</span> </p><p><span m='24976'>maybe
  the app doesn't work, or maybe there's something</span> <span m='29326'>about
  the parts you're trying to wrap together.</span> </p><p><span m='31436'>What
  gene are you trying to build?</span> </p><p><span m='32796'>>> Dude: I just
  grabbed these 3 parts to try.</span> </p><p><span m='34596'>>> Sally: A
  terminator, an operator and an open reading frame?</span> </p><p><span
  m='38076'>That's not a gene...</span> </p><p><span m='39366'>>> Dude: but it's
  got an open reading frame...what more do I need?</span> </p><p><span
  m='42616'>>> Sally: Walk with me Dude.</span> </p><p><span m='43596'>For
  starters you'll need a promoter.</span> </p><p><span m='45616'>That's a
  snippet of DNA that the RNA polymerase binds to when it starts
  transcription.</span> </p><p><span m='51146'>Promoters come in different
  strengths so choose carefully.</span> </p><p><span m='54046'>>> Dude: How do I
  know if a promoter is strong or weak?</span> </p><p><span m='56446'>>> Sally:
  Well the strongest promoters have this DNA sequence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='59526'>RNA polymerase can bind these bases well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='62046'>The more bases that are different from this consensus sequence, the
  weaker the promoter is</span> <span m='66606'>since RNA polymerase will bind
  less well and transcribe less often...at least...</span> </p><p><span
  m='71626'>that's how it usually works.</span> </p><p><span m='73286'>>> Dude:
  oh no!</span> </p><p><span m='73376'>I hear an exception coming...</span>
  </p><p><span m='75386'>>> Sally: Well sure Dude...it's very clever
  really.</span> </p><p><span m='77876'>There are promoters that are used in
  different stages of cell growth</span> <span m='80816'>and those promoters
  bind a slightly different RNA polymerase</span> <span m='83816'>so they have a
  consensus sequence that's a little different from this one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='86816'>And then there are still other promoters that have lots
  of differences</span> <span m='90036'>from this consensus sequence but they
  are still strong promoters</span> <span m='93086'>since they also have DNA
  sequences nearby that bind activating proteins.</span> </p><p><span
  m='97456'>The activators help RNA polymerase find the promoter</span> <span
  m='100226'>and that gets transcription really cranking.</span> </p><p><span
  m='102246'>Activated promoters can be very strong.</span> </p><p><span
  m='104426'>>> Dude: When does it end!?!</span> </p><p><span m='105936'>>>
  Sally: Another great question Dude!...there are sequences that come</span>
  <span m='108996'>after the open reading frame called terminators.</span>
  </p><p><span m='111186'>These tell RNA polymerase to stop transcribing RNA and
  to leave the DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='115346'>These terminators are really
  useful if you have another promoter downstream of this gene.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120296'>You'll need a terminator if you don't want the
  polymerase to read</span> <span m='122986'>through this gene into the next one
  downstream.</span> </p><p><span m='125236'>>> Dude: "Downstream?"</span> <span
  m='126466'>Don't you mean "on the right?"</span> <span m='128596'>>> Sally:
  Cells don't know their right from their left so we have</span> <span
  m='130826'>to use the natural polarity of double stranded DNA when we give
  directions.</span> </p><p><span m='134756'>"Downstream" means "more 3-prime"
  no matter which strand of the DNA you're working on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='138776'>>> Dude: So in this app I can wrap any promoter,</span> <span
  m='142056'>ORF and terminator together, and I've got a gene!</span>
  </p><p><span m='146806'>>> Sally: Well actually you've got a transcription
  unit,</span> <span m='148816'>and most of the time you'll want to translate
  the RNA from that unit into a protein.</span> </p><p><span m='152746'>To
  translate it, you'll need to include a ribosome binding site.</span>
  </p><p><span m='156156'>The RBS is where ribosomes attach to the RNA
  message</span> <span m='159136'>so they can start linking the specified amino
  acids into a protein chain.</span> </p><p><span m='162686'>And you can control
  the strength of the RBS to control how much of the message gets
  translated.</span> </p><p><span m='167696'>>> Dude: and I'll bet there's an
  app for that too...</span> </p><p><span m='168886'>>> Sally: well if you're
  interested in working on one,</span> <span m='172076'>let me tell you about
  how genes are arranged in eukaryotic cells like plants, yeast and
  human...</span> </p><p><span m='176366'>>> Dude: Can we do that another day
  Sally?</span> </p><p><span m='178096'>My disk space nearly full.</span> </p>
