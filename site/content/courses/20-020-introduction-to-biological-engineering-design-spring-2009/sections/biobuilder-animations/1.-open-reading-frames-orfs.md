title: 1. Open Reading Frames (ORFs)
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='8466'>>> Dude: Hey Sally.</span> </p><p><span m='9556'>>> Sally:
  Hmmm?</span> </p><p><span m='10226'>>> Dude: How come Buddy is green and I'm
  not?</span> </p><p><span m='12766'>>> Sally: Well Dude.</span> </p><p><span
  m='13356'>Your parents aren't green and I'm guessing that Buddy's parent
  was.</span> </p><p><span m='16896'>>> Dude: That's not what I mean...like,
  what makes him green?</span> </p><p><span m='20466'>>> Sally: Envy?</span>
  </p><p><span m='21346'>>> Dude: Fine, I'll figure it out myself.</span>
  </p><p><span m='25156'>Alright! Here it is.</span> </p><p><span m='27666'>Hey
  Sally, check this out.</span> </p><p><span m='30266'>All of Buddy's DNA is
  online.</span> </p><p><span m='31966'>Now all I have to do is find the part
  that makes him green.</span> </p><p><span m='35526'>What a nightmare.</span>
  </p><p><span m='37066'>It all looks the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='38036'>Just Gs, As, Ts, and Cs.</span> </p><p><span m='39846'>How am I
  suppose to know what's what?</span> </p><p><span m='42376'>Someone needs to
  write a manual.</span> </p><p><span m='44926'>>> Sally: We are writing one,
  but it's a work in progress.</span> </p><p><span m='47676'>Why is Buddy
  green?</span> </p><p><span m='48966'>Well, it's probably because he makes a
  protein or two that turn him green.</span> </p><p><span m='52566'>We can
  figure that out, because sequences that code for proteins have a few things in
  common.</span> </p><p><span m='57976'>>> Dude: Oh I remember now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='59826'>They all start with ATG then call out for amino acids
  using three bases at a time.</span> </p><p><span m='65316'>>> Sally: Those 3
  bases are called triplet codons.</span> </p><p><span m='68016'>Here's a look
  up table with the genetic code for Buddy.</span> </p><p><span m='71336'>It
  tells you which amino acids are encoded by each triplet codon.</span>
  </p><p><span m='75076'>>> Dude: OK I got it now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='76726'>Here's an ATG for the methionine start, then I see a TAT, that
  translates to tyrosine,</span> <span m='82545'>then TAG that will make a
  ...stop?</span> </p><p><span m='86295'>That's only two amino acids.</span>
  </p><p><span m='87906'>That seems too short to do anything in the cell.</span>
  </p><p><span m='90136'>>> Sally: You've just figured out something really
  important.</span> </p><p><span m='92696'>Not every ORF will make a
  protein.</span> </p><p><span m='94946'>As a rule of thumb, people consider 100
  amino acids the minimum to produce a protein,</span> <span m='100326'>even
  though there are lots of proteins we know that contain fewer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='103556'>>> Dude: Did you say ORF or did you just burp?</span>
  </p><p><span m='107856'>>> Sally: didn't burp!</span> </p><p><span
  m='109376'>ORF stands for open reading frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='111376'>It's a register for reading the section of DNA that starts with
  ATG, uses 3 letters at a time</span> <span m='117406'>to call for amino acids
  and then uses one or more of the stop codons to close the reading.</span>
  </p><p><span m='123056'>>> Dude: So in this DNA sequence there are 3 reading
  frames that I have to look through?</span> </p><p><span m='127256'>That will
  take me forever.</span> </p><p><span m='128756'>>> Sally: Actually it will
  take you forever times two since there are 6 reading frames.</span>
  </p><p><span m='133616'>Remember DNA is double stranded and the bottom strand,
  the one you're not seeing here,</span> <span m='138076'>might also have ORFs
  that make proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='140176'>>> Dude: Please tell me
  there are computer programs to help me with this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143166'>>> Sally: There are lots of good ones, but once you find all the
  ORFs what will you do?</span> </p><p><span m='147186'>>> Dude: Yeah...then
  what?</span> </p><p><span m='149166'>How will I know which of the ORFs really
  make proteins?</span> </p><p><span m='151786'>And what if I've missed a
  bunch?</span> </p><p><span m='152976'>Maybe some proteins that turn Buddy
  green are only a few amino acids long.</span> </p><p><span m='156836'>>>
  Sally: Nice!</span> </p><p><span m='157526'>You've got the start of a really
  interesting project here.</span> </p><p><span m='160536'>But remember that
  discovering important proteins is only part of your job.</span> </p><p><span
  m='164516'>If you really want to engineer biology you'll have to refine the
  genetic material</span> <span m='168766'>so you and others can build with
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='170626'>Before Buddy wakes up, can I show you one
  great example?</span> </p>
