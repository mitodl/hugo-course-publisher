title: 9. The iGEM Competition
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='10416'>>> Sally: Dude!</span> </p><p><span m='11226'>No running in
  the laboratory.</span> </p><p><span m='12756'>>> Dude: Sorry Sally, but have
  you heard about this competition?</span> </p><p><span m='15546'>It's called
  iGEM and I think my bacterial bubble could totally win this year.</span>
  </p><p><span m='19896'>>> Sally: I thought you were done with bacterial
  bubbles.</span> </p><p><span m='22326'>What do you know about iGEM?</span>
  </p><p><span m='24126'>>> Dude: Uh, not much, except that there's going to be
  a bunch of losers and me.</span> </p><p><span m='29066'>>> Sally: I don't
  think you understand the nature of this competition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='31696'>iGEM, the International Genetically Engineered Machine
  Competition,</span> <span m='35356'>is a way to get young scientists and
  engineers working together to engineer biological systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='40736'>>> Dude: Working together?</span> </p><p><span m='41856'>Where's the
  competitive spirit in that?</span> </p><p><span m='43476'>The Dude works
  alone.</span> </p><p><span m='45166'>That way, the Dude gets all the
  credit.</span> </p><p><span m='48086'>>> Sally: You need to be a member of a
  team to join iGEM, and you need a professor to lead it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52076'>>> Dude: But I heard it was a student competition?</span>
  </p><p><span m='54006'>>> Sally: Well, yes.</span> </p><p><span m='54856'>The
  competition started in 2004 based on an undergraduate class developed at MIT
  in 2003</span> <span m='60766'>for their short winter session, and it
  continues to be an undergraduate experience.</span> </p><p><span m='65296'>But
  not without guidance and support.</span> </p><p><span m='67376'>Last year
  there were more than thirty teams who competed, from all over the
  world.</span> </p><p><span m='71656'>>> Dude: So that's my competition?</span>
  </p><p><span m='74226'>That's a lot of people.</span> </p><p><span
  m='75526'>>> Sally: A lot of people, all asking the same question.</span>
  </p><p><span m='77936'>"Can simple biological systems be built from
  standard,</span> <span m='81316'>interchangeable parts and operate in living
  cells?</span> </p><p><span m='85156'>Or is biology simply too complicated to
  be engineered in this way?"</span> <span m='89446'>What do you think?</span>
  </p><p><span m='90506'>>> Dude: Biology's not too complicated for me!</span>
  </p><p><span m='95466'>The goals of this competition are to enable systematic
  engineering of biology, promote open</span> <span m='101276'>and transparent
  development of tools for engineering biology,</span> <span m='104526'>and help
  construct a society that can productively apply biological technology.</span>
  </p><p><span m='111786'>OK, I've got a lot of work ahead of me.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114426'>If we're not going to use my bubble idea, what else is
  possible?</span> </p><p><span m='118606'>>> Sally: Maybe a better question
  would be what isn't possible.</span> </p><p><span m='121916'>>> Dude: Ok, so
  first off: What should our standard, interchangeable part be?</span>
  </p><p><span m='125536'>Actually, what parts exist?</span> </p><p><span
  m='126816'>Do we have to make those?</span> </p><p><span m='128006'>>> Sally:
  You'll probably need more than one but the Registry</span> <span m='130566'>of
  Standard Biological Parts is a great resource with lots of parts already
  designed.</span> </p><p><span m='135286'>And if we make parts of our own, we
  should add them to the Registry</span> <span m='138126'>in case other teams
  can use them too.</span> </p><p><span m='140256'>>> Dude: And help the other
  teams?</span> </p><p><span m='142026'>What kind of competition is that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='144356'>Or is that how so many teams got cool projects going
  last year?: Pleasant smelling bacteria,</span> <span m='148936'>a bacterial
  night-light, a DNA drug delivery system.</span> </p><p><span m='151766'>I
  heard one team even made up bacterial freeze tag!</span> </p><p><span
  m='154986'>To beat those, we should get started right now!</span> </p><p><span
  m='157696'>>> Sally: Alright well let's brainstorm for a little while before I
  have to get back to work.</span> </p><p><span m='161286'>How does that
  sound?</span> </p><p><span m='162516'>>> Dude: Great!</span> </p><p><span
  m='163516'>Can you show me this Registry?</span> </p><p><span m='165276'>Maybe
  we can find some good parts to use!</span> </p><p><span m='168036'>>> Sally:
  Good idea, Dude.</span> </p><p><span m='169356'>Let's start there.</span> </p>
