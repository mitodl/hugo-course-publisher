  biological system, why can't we design them to snap together like pieces  from
  a model robot kit?  </span></p>

transcript: >-
  <p><span m='8206'>>> Sally: Happy Birthday Dude.</span> </p><p><span
  m='9516'>>> Dude: Geez Sally.</span> </p><p><span m='10356'>I can't believe
  you remembered!</span> </p><p><span m='13306'>Can I open this now?</span>
  </p><p><span m='14726'>>> Sally: Of course, I hope you like it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='16956'>>> Dude: Sounds like it has parts!</span> </p><p><span
  m='18746'>>> Sally: I know how much you like to build things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20786'>>> Dude: I think I know what it is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='22106'>Will I have to keep this here in the lab?</span> </p><p><span
  m='24536'>>> Sally: Only if you want to.</span> </p><p><span m='26456'>>>
  Dude: Awesome.</span> </p><p><span m='28296'>It's an electronics building
  kit.</span> </p><p><span m='30466'>>> Sally: It has all the parts to build a
  bug that scoots around on the floor.</span> </p><p><span m='33856'>The box
  says the red laser eyes will flash when it hears a voice.</span> </p><p><span
  m='37216'>Dude, do you like it?</span> </p><p><span m='39206'>>> Dude: I
  do...I guess...but...well I thought this might be the parts to build something
  real.</span> </p><p><span m='46326'>You know, something living...like a real
  bug with red eyes and legs that move.</span> </p><p><span m='50836'>>> Sally:
  You thought the box had parts for genetic programming?</span> </p><p><span
  m='53336'>>> Dude: Yeah...that's what I really want to try.</span>
  </p><p><span m='57156'>If I do OK snapping these wires and lights together,
  can I get a genetics kit next?</span> </p><p><span m='62446'>>> Sally: I would
  love to give you that!</span> </p><p><span m='64656'>But there is no
  snap-together version.</span> </p><p><span m='67296'>Here let me show you the
  closest thing.</span> </p><p><span m='69756'>You know that all living things
  are programmed by their DNA, their genomes.</span> </p><p><span m='73826'>And
  that DNA is made of four kinds of nucleotides, G,A,T,C.</span> </p><p><span
  m='78186'>But even when we know the order of every nucleotide in the master
  program,</span> <span m='82206'>we still don't completely understand how the
  program works.</span> </p><p><span m='85556'>So it's not easy to snap together
  a new genetic program that works predictably.</span> </p><p><span m='90606'>To
  really program with DNA we'll need our own programming language, one that
  allows us</span> <span m='95306'>to create our own grammar and
  vocabulary.</span> </p><p><span m='97456'>We can call the words parts where
  each part describes some biological function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='101596'>Here's a functional sequence I happen to know.</span> </p><p><span
  m='105966'>>> Dude: Is that a real sequence?</span> </p><p><span m='107616'>>>
  Sally: What do you mean real?</span> </p><p><span m='108906'>It's really
  nucleotides.</span> </p><p><span m='110446'>>> Dude: I mean does it do
  anything?</span> </p><p><span m='112765'>Is it really a part?</span>
  </p><p><span m='114256'>>> Sally: It is.</span> </p><p><span m='115146'>This
  one is a promoter, a piece of DNA where the RNA polymerase</span> <span
  m='118856'>from the bacteriophage T7 can bind.</span> </p><p><span
  m='121496'>>> Dude: But how did you know that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='123346'>How am I supposed to know that?</span> </p><p><span m='125366'>>>
  Sally: Dude, that's the point!</span> </p><p><span m='126996'>>> Dude:
  What?</span> </p><p><span m='127696'>That you know more than me?!</span>
  </p><p><span m='129566'>>> Sally: No.</span> </p><p><span m='130175'>Look. The
  point is that we can describe the function of a sequence and catalog it</span>
  <span m='134186'>so you don't have to memorize sequences.</span> </p><p><span
  m='136526'>No one does.</span> </p><p><span m='137406'>Here, let's draw a
  black box around the sequence itself and call it a promoter part.</span>
  </p><p><span m='145736'>>> Dude: Here, let me try?</span> </p><p><span
  m='146946'>>> Sally: Dude!</span> </p><p><span m='147226'>>> Dude: No Sally,
  really.</span> </p><p><span m='148656'>Parts are only cool if they can be
  snapped together.</span> </p><p><span m='151046'>Even this electronics kit
  makes it easy to hook the wires up to the battery and the LED.</span>
  </p><p><span m='156256'>The instruction book gives me rules for putting the
  parts together</span> <span m='159036'>so I don't short circuit or fry the
  thing.</span> </p><p><span m='161206'>Don't be mad but I really don't see how
  biological parts will help me write a new</span> <span m='166555'>genetic
  program if there isn't an easy way to put them together so they'll
  work.</span> </p><p><span m='171216'>>> Sally: I'm not mad.</span>
  </p><p><span m='172116'>These are two really important ideas, and you're
  exactly right.</span> </p><p><span m='175555'>No one knows the all rules for
  reliably assembling genetic programs</span> <span m='179276'>but there are
  some ideas about how to put the parts together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='181926'>Want to look?</span> </p><p><span m='182916'>>> Dude: Sure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='184006'>>> Sally: Well the parts will need to be
  standardized</span> <span m='186096'>in some way so they can snap
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='188456'>Let's look at BioBricks for one
  example.</span> </p>
