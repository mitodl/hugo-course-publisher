title: 8. Measurement for Biological Parts
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='8125'>>> Izzy: Hi Dude!</span> </p><p><span m='8946'>What are you
  up to?</span> </p><p><span m='9596'>>> Dude: I'm picking a promoter to use to
  in Buddy.</span> </p><p><span m='11786'>I need a promoter that is always on
  that will make Buddy be red.</span> </p><p><span m='15256'>>> Izzy: So why are
  you poking at the computer screen?</span> </p><p><span m='17656'>>> Dude: Well
  how else do I pick one?</span> </p><p><span m='19246'>I don't know which one
  to use so I figured I'd leave it to chance to decide.</span> </p><p><span
  m='22676'>>> Izzy: Well why don't you use some of the promoter
  characterization data available</span> <span m='27216'>on the Registry of
  Standard Biological Parts to decide?</span> </p><p><span m='30116'>>> Dude:
  What is promoter measurement data?</span> </p><p><span m='31916'>>> Sally: Hi
  Dude.</span> </p><p><span m='32686'>Hi Izzy. Sounds like you two are having an
  interesting conversation.</span> </p><p><span m='36956'>>> Izzy: Yeah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='37556'>I was just about to tell Dude how to use promoter
  measurement data</span> <span m='41506'>to pick the right promoter for
  Buddy.</span> </p><p><span m='43396'>>> Sally: Well before you get into those
  details it might be worth chatting a bit</span> <span m='47226'>about
  measurement in general.</span> </p><p><span m='49086'>Why synthetic biologists
  measure part function?</span> </p><p><span m='52036'>What measurements they
  make and how they do the measurements before getting</span> <span
  m='55536'>into the details of the data itself?</span> </p><p><span
  m='57786'>>> Izzy: That's true!</span> </p><p><span m='58906'>>> Sally: Why
  don't we take a walk?</span> </p><p><span m='60446'>Get some fresh air while
  we talk.</span> </p><p><span m='62066'>Measurement is a key aspect of science
  and engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='65536'>It lets you quantify the
  function of a part or component</span> <span m='68356'>and compare its
  function to that of others.</span> </p><p><span m='71045'>Unfortunately in
  synthetic biology, we're still figuring</span> <span m='74795'>out what are
  the most useful measurements to make for genetic parts and devices.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78836'>>> Dude: What do you mean?</span> </p><p><span
  m='80066'>Why don't we just measure everything for every part?</span>
  </p><p><span m='82776'>>> Sally: Well that can pretty quickly lead both to a
  lot of wasted time in making measurements</span> <span m='87646'>that don't
  matter as well as an overwhelming amount of information.</span> </p><p><span
  m='91446'>Ideally, we'd like to be able to only measure those characteristics
  of a part that you need</span> <span m='95976'>to know in order to decide
  whether the part will work in your system of interest.</span> </p><p><span
  m='100045'>>> Izzy: For example, when I bought a computer recently,</span>
  <span m='102786'>I cared about how big the hard drive was and how much memory
  it had,</span> <span m='107126'>because those were two performance metrics
  that I could use to figure</span> <span m='110466'>out whether the computer
  would be sufficient for my needs.</span> </p><p><span m='113306'>>> Dude: Well
  in the case of Buddy, I just need to know</span> <span m='115586'>which
  promoter to use that will make him red.</span> </p><p><span m='118246'>>>
  Izzy: But how red do you want Buddy to be?</span> </p><p><span
  m='120356'>Should Buddy be pink, red, or dark red?</span> </p><p><span
  m='122836'>To make decisions like that, you might need to know a bit
  more</span> <span m='125666'>about how strong the promoter is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='127786'>>> Sally: Exactly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='129376'>Another measurement you might care about is how long the part works
  before it breaks.</span> </p><p><span m='133816'>Genetic parts can "break" as
  Buddy grows and divides.</span> </p><p><span m='137926'>For example, mutations
  or deletions can happen that interfere with part function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143196'>So depending on how long you expect Buddy to stick around, you
  might choose promoters</span> <span m='147996'>that are more or less
  genetically stable.</span> </p><p><span m='149986'>>> Dude: Whoa!</span>
  </p><p><span m='151416'>I had no idea that measuring part function could be so
  complicated!</span> </p><p><span m='155106'>Well I think I am going to find
  myself a strong promoter from the registry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='159646'>I've decided that I want Buddy to be very dark red!</span>
  </p><p><span m='163576'>>> Sally & Izzy: Have fun!</span> </p><p><span
  m='165566'>>> Sally & Izzy: Jinx!</span> </p>
