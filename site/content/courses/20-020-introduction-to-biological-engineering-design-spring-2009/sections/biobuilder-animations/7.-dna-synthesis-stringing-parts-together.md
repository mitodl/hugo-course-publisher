transcript: >-
  <p><span m='8336'>>> Sally: I think this year's iGEM competition is the best
  ever.</span> </p><p><span m='11776'>The project we just heard about was
  amazing!</span> </p><p><span m='14236'>>> Dude: And that bacterial flotation
  device was totally cool!</span> </p><p><span m='18026'>It's the
  balloon-o-genesis module I've been looking for.</span> </p><p><span
  m='20746'>I want to try it with my Bacterial Balloon idea.</span> </p><p><span
  m='23636'>I know it'll work.</span> </p><p><span m='24676'>>> Sally: I thought
  you were done with Bacterial Balloons!</span> </p><p><span m='27456'>>> Dude:
  Sally, where's your curiosity?</span> </p><p><span m='29706'>We'll need to put
  the flotation-thing-a-ma-gjiggy together</span> <span m='31736'>with the
  Gas-o-Matic module and this time put some feedback program at the
  promoters</span> <span m='35786'>to make the devices stop...this is SO going
  to work.</span> </p><p><span m='40756'>>> Sally: We can try to build it when
  we get back to lab but some</span> <span m='43866'>of it looks like very
  specialized DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='47586'>First, we'll need a feedback
  loop that works for Buddy.</span> </p><p><span m='50586'>Second, the flotation
  module is more than 6000 base pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='54546'>Didn't that
  team say that it works better if these two sections are removed?</span>
  </p><p><span m='58416'>Maybe we should directly synthesize the shorter
  flotation part with a Buddy feedback loop,</span> <span m='62766'>then we can
  hook it up to the Gas-o-Matic module we already have in the lab.</span>
  </p><p><span m='66496'>>> Dude: Now you're talking!</span> </p><p><span
  m='67866'>But I think I forgot how to directly synthesize DNA...I mean we've
  done so many things</span> <span m='72506'>in the lab and I remember a lot of
  them but...</span> </p><p><span m='75096'>>> Sally: Dude, we don't synthesize
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='76886'>We get a company to do that for us.</span>
  </p><p><span m='79006'>>> Dude: Whew.</span> </p><p><span m='79646'>So do I
  copy down this picture from the board and mail it to them?</span> </p><p><span
  m='82476'>>> Sally: You could but they wouldn't know what to do with
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='85306'>We'll need to send them the exact DNA
  sequence, and then they can string the Gs, As, Ts,</span> <span m='90926'>and
  Cs together in the right order.</span> </p><p><span m='92786'>Every DNA
  synthesis company does it a little differently</span> <span m='96045'>but the
  chemistry is pretty standard.</span> </p><p><span m='98216'>It involves
  protection and deprotection of a growing DNA chain</span> <span
  m='101876'>with specialized bases called deoxynucleoside
  phosphoramidites.</span> </p><p><span m='105886'>>> Dude: Gesundheit!</span>
  </p><p><span m='107466'>Sorry. What's so special about them?</span>
  </p><p><span m='109386'>>> Sally: Only one base links to a DNA chain at a time
  until you deprotect the end,</span> <span m='113746'>which then allows you to
  add the next base in your sequence.</span> </p><p><span m='116866'>>> Dude:
  That sounds like a pain.</span> </p><p><span m='118256'>>> Sally: No, think
  about it.</span> </p><p><span m='119606'>All you have to do is attach your
  first base, let's say a protected G, to some sort of polymer</span> <span
  m='124856'>or bead, and then when you deprotect the G you can add a second
  base, how about an A?</span> </p><p><span m='130056'>Then when you deprotect
  that A, you can add a third base, let's put a T there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='134446'>>> Dude: Ha!</span> </p><p><span m='135236'>even I know that won't
  work.</span> </p><p><span m='136936'>What if that A doesn't hook up?</span>
  </p><p><span m='138786'>Then you've got G-T instead of G-A-T.</span>
  </p><p><span m='141876'>What good is that?</span> </p><p><span m='142986'>>>
  Sally: Dude, you're smart, but so are the chemists who worked on this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='146736'>There's one more step called "capping" so that any
  deprotected base</span> <span m='150416'>that doesn't properly connect is shut
  down and can't be added to.</span> </p><p><span m='154506'>Those shorter
  pieces of DNA can be taken out of the mix at the very end.</span> </p><p><span
  m='158016'>>> Dude: But won't there be a lot of mistakes to get rid of?</span>
  </p><p><span m='160696'>Even if capping works half the time, you'll be getting
  rid of half your sequence,</span> <span m='164716'>then half of that
  half...you'll have nothing left.</span> </p><p><span m='167866'>>> Sally:
  Luckily this construction process is more like 99% efficient.</span>
  </p><p><span m='172256'>But even so, you can't build something as long as this
  6000 base pair flotation device.</span> </p><p><span m='177546'>Most companies
  build a bunch of shorter oligo nucleotides, maybe 60 base pairs long,</span>
  <span m='182716'>and then use PCR to stitch them together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='185116'>>> Dude: and you trust them to do all this right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='187866'>>> Sally: They verify the final DNA by sequencing it
  before they send it to you.</span> </p><p><span m='192196'>Sometimes there are
  problems at one stage or another</span> <span m='194806'>but DNA synthesis is
  getting faster and less expensive every year.</span> </p><p><span
  m='199486'>>> Dude: Sally this is great!</span> </p><p><span m='201246'>With
  your credit card and my ideas, we can write some DNA that's completely
  new.</span> </p><p><span m='205766'>Race you back to lab.</span> </p><p><span
  m='207146'>I want to get this DNA ordered today.</span> </p>
