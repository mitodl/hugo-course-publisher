title: 10. Biosafety Levels
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='9466'>>> Sally: What are you working on?</span> </p><p><span
  m='10326'>>> Dude: I've got a great new idea.</span> </p><p><span
  m='11616'>I'm going to make cocoa beans that reproduce as fast as
  viruses.</span> </p><p><span m='15316'>That way, we'll have enough cocoa beans
  to make as much chocolate as we want!</span> </p><p><span m='19256'>>> Sally:
  You know how much I like chocolate!</span> </p><p><span m='20716'>Explain your
  project a little more.</span> </p><p><span m='23056'>How are you going to
  engineer this yummy idea?</span> </p><p><span m='25526'>>> Dude: Well viruses
  reproduce really fast so I thought I could take that part</span> <span
  m='28856'>from a virus and put it into a cocoa plant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='31206'>>> Sally: Plants are pretty safe to work with but viruses can be
  dangerous.</span> </p><p><span m='34756'>Which virus were you thinking about
  using?</span> </p><p><span m='36896'>>> Dude: Well I read that Ebola virus has
  a short sequence that...</span> </p><p><span m='39366'>>> Sally:
  ...EBOLA!?!</span> </p><p><span m='40226'>Ebola is a bio-safety level FOUR
  agent.</span> </p><p><span m='43186'>>> Dude: Well the worst are level five,
  so I thought it was safe enough.</span> </p><p><span m='46386'>>> Sally: Level
  five?</span> </p><p><span m='47386'>There is no bio-safety level five.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49606'>You'd need lots and lots of training to work in any
  level three or four facility...</span> </p><p><span m='54296'>...and you'd
  have to wait a few years since they don't let minors in those labs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='57656'>>> Dude: DD: But there was this show I saw on TV
  where...</span> </p><p><span m='60136'>>> Sally: What you see on TV and in
  movies can be very deceiving.</span> </p><p><span m='63306'>But let's talk
  about all the bio-safety levels.</span> </p><p><span m='65766'>If we're going
  to make your viral cocoa beans, we need to come up with a way</span> <span
  m='69236'>that keeps everyone safe, inside the lab and outside too.</span>
  </p><p><span m='72856'>>> Dude: OK.</span> </p><p><span m='73676'>I do know
  that biosafety is a combination of safe lab practices and techniques,</span>
  <span m='78176'>wearing the right safety equipment, and working in a lab
  designed to contain the experiment.</span> </p><p><span m='82216'>But with
  biosafety level 1 that just means a room</span> <span m='84956'>with screened
  windows and a door that closes.</span> </p><p><span m='86986'>That doesn't
  sound like much.</span> </p><p><span m='88486'>>> Sally: That's because BL1
  experiments use only well-characterized microbes</span> <span m='92566'>that
  don't make a healthy person sick.</span> </p><p><span m='94526'>But remember,
  there's no eating or drinking in the lab</span> <span m='97176'>since you
  wouldn't want to eat your experiments.</span> </p><p><span m='100036'>>> Dude:
  When do I get to wear a lab coat like yours?</span> </p><p><span m='102456'>>>
  Sally: If you're working at biosafety level 2, you'll have to wear it, and
  gloves, too,</span> <span m='106485'>since some BL2 agents can be
  infectious.</span> </p><p><span m='108906'>BL2 labs have impervious benches
  and most of the work is done in biological safety cabinets.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114246'>Lots of BL2 workers also get immunizations if they'll
  be working with certain agents.</span> </p><p><span m='118976'>>> Dude: I hate
  getting shots.</span> </p><p><span m='121046'>>> Sally: Well, not all level 2
  agents require immunizations.</span> </p><p><span m='124216'>Really, the rules
  for BL1 and BL2 are pretty basic</span> <span m='127466'>because the agents
  have minimal risk associated with them.</span> </p><p><span m='130496'>But
  let's think for a minute about what biosafety you'd need</span> <span
  m='133476'>for your mash-up of a virus with a cocoa plant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='136036'>>> Dude: Well maybe more protective clothes, like the workers in
  bio-safety level 3 labs.</span> </p><p><span m='140276'>They wear full suits
  and maybe masks or something.</span> </p><p><span m='143336'>It's nothing I
  can't handle.</span> </p><p><span m='145006'>Imagine me in a space
  suit!</span> </p><p><span m='147776'>Very cool!</span> </p><p><span
  m='149446'>And think about how much chocolate we'll have!</span> </p><p><span
  m='151626'>>> Sally: Earth to Dude!</span> </p><p><span m='152996'>Level three
  agents are very serious, potentially lethal, and level four agents, like Ebola
  virus,</span> <span m='158646'>have such a high lethal risk that there are
  only a few places</span> <span m='161305'>in the world where they are
  studied.</span> </p><p><span m='162996'>Restrictions for working with these
  agents are very tight.</span> </p><p><span m='166126'>Everything entering or
  leaving BL3 and BL4 labs has to be decontaminated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='170706'>Sometimes the lab has to be in its own building to control foot
  traffic.</span> </p><p><span m='174136'>I know I don't want to work where
  there are double door entries and airlock rooms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='177676'>>> Dude: I think that sounds like fun...</span> </p><p><span
  m='179136'>>> Sally: ...If you are so excited about the protective
  clothing,</span> <span m='181416'>we can always be overly cautious in a level
  1 or 2 facility.</span> </p><p><span m='184906'>But can't we find another way
  to make more cocoa beans?</span> </p><p><span m='187816'>>> Dude: OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='189036'>>> Sally: Maybe we can find another virus that's not
  so dangerous</span> <span m='191706'>and we can keep working on your chocolate
  idea.</span> </p><p><span m='193926'>Let's start looking in here.</span> </p>
