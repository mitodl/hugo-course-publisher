In this assignment you will address the characteristics of "good design." For instance, [Joel Schindall](https://gelp.mit.edu/about-gel/program-staff/joel-schindall) from the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program offers these elements of **good product design**:

*   You know it when you see it
*   Minimalist — meets requirements in an efficient manner
*   Wow factor — leaps out at you
*   Robust — failure-resistant
*   "Anticipatory" — easily modified to overcome unanticipated problems (this is subtle but important)
*   Adaptable
*   Expandable
*   Flexible
*   Combines functions to increase efficiency — mounting bracket doubles as heat sink, etc.

By contrast, [this interview with Blade Kotelly](http://www.acm.org/ubiquity/interviews/b_kotelly_2.html) from Endeca Technologies offers these elements of **good software design:**

*   Visually Clean
*   Communicates clearly and quickly
*   Anthropomorphic
*   Useful in some way (intended or unintended)
*   Provides clear feedback
*   Keeps users oriented as to their current state
*   Maintains locus of control with user
*   Emotionally compelling
*   Provides simple controls for input
*   Aligns to societal mores

Now it's your turn. Please make 2 lists. The first list should be 5-10 characteristics of **good design in biology as we find it in the natural world**. The second list should be 5-10 characteristics of **good design in biologically engineered technologies**.

If you can articulate "what makes it great," then you should be in a powerful position to make wise decisions about project ideas, to accurately evaluate competing ideas and technologies, and to fully appreciate of what exists and what can be improved.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}
