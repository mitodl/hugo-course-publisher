Project process: 3 Ideas presentation

At this early stage in your team's work you should continue to seriously consider several possible paths. These ideas will have been collected from the first few assignments you completed individually. Now is the time to shine a spotlight on some of the ideas that seemed most engaging and interesting.

Purpose of 3 Ideas Presentation

1.  To detail three ideas in your area of interest using 4 common criteria

3.  To gain some experience working as a team to define the ideas and to critically consider their strengths and weaknesses
