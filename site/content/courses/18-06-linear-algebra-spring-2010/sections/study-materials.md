[Wellesley-Cambridge Press](http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/), 2009. ISBN: 9780980232714.

The Table of Contents, Preface, and selected chapters are [freely available online](http://math.mit.edu/linearalgebra/).

There is newer edition of the book: [![Buy at Amazon](/images/a_logo_17.gif)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0980232775/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20) Strang, Gilbert. _Introduction to Linear Algebra_. 5th ed. [Wellesley-Cambridge Press](http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/), 2016. ISBN: 9780980232776.

NOTE: More material on linear algebra (and much more about differential equations) is in Professor Strang's 2014 textbook _[Differential Equations and Linear Algebra](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/dela)_. In 2016, the textbook was developed into a series of 55 short videos,Â _[Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with Gilbert Strang and Cleve Moler](/resources/res-18-009-learn-differential-equations-up-close-with-gilbert-strang-and-cleve-moler-fall-2015/index.htm)._
