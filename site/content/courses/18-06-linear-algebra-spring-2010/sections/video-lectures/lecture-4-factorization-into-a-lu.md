transcript: >-
  <p><span m="12380"> Okay, this is linear algebra, lecture
  four.</span></p><p><span m="16800">And, the first thing I have to do is
  something that was on the list for last time, but here</span> <span
  m="24810">it is now.</span></p><p><span m="26169">What's the inverse of a
  product?</span></p><p><span m="29369">If I multiply two matrices together and
  I know their inverses, how do I get the inverse</span> <span m="36300">of A
  times B?</span></p><p><span m="39559">So I know what inverses mean for a
  single matrix A and for a matrix B.</span></p><p><span m="46760">What matrix
  do I multiply by to get the identity if I have A B?</span></p><p><span
  m="53229">Okay, that'll be simple but so basic.</span></p><p><span
  m="57100">Then I'm going to use that to -- I will have a product of matrices
  and the product that</span> <span m="66120">we'll meet will be these
  elimination matrices and the net result of today's lectures is</span> <span
  m="73660">the big formula for elimination, so the net result of today's
  lecture is this great way</span> <span m="82960">to look at Gaussian
  elimination.</span></p><p><span m="87710">We know that we get from A to U by
  elimination.</span></p><p><span m="91400">We know the steps -- but now we get
  the right way to look at it, A equals L U.</span></p><p><span m="98060">So
  that's the high point for today.</span></p><p><span
  m="100800">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="101800">Can I take the easy part, the
  first step first?</span></p><p><span m="107320">So, suppose A is invertible --
  and of course it's going to be a big question, when is the</span> <span
  m="114560">matrix invertible?</span></p><p><span m="115860">But let's say A is
  invertible and B is invertible, then what matrix gives me the inverse of A
  B?</span></p><p><span m="124920">So that's the direct
  question.</span></p><p><span m="127470">What's the inverse of A
  B?</span></p><p><span m="128869">Do I multiply those separate
  inverses?</span></p><p><span m="132120">Yes. I multiply the two matrices A
  inverse and B inverse, but what order do I multiply?</span></p><p><span
  m="141230">In reverse order.</span></p><p><span m="142290">And you see
  why.</span></p><p><span m="144020">So the right thing to put here is B inverse
  A inverse.</span></p><p><span m="149780">That's the inverse I'm
  after.</span></p><p><span m="151820">We can just check that A B times that
  matrix gives the identity.</span></p><p><span
  m="158950">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="159950">So why -- once again, it's this
  fact that I can move parentheses around.</span></p><p><span m="166480">I can
  just erase them all and do the multiplications any way I want
  to.</span></p><p><span m="172329">So what's the right multiplication to do
  first?</span></p><p><span m="176209">B times B inverse.</span></p><p><span
  m="178220">This product here I is the identity.</span></p><p><span
  m="182400">Then A times the identity is the identity and then finally A times
  A inverse gives the</span> <span m="188100">identity.</span></p><p><span
  m="190060">So forgive the dumb example in the book.</span></p><p><span
  m="195680">Why do you, do the inverse things in reverse
  order?</span></p><p><span m="201189">It's just like -- you take off your
  shoes, you take off your socks, then the good way</span> <span m="207020">to
  invert that process is socks back on first, then shoes.</span></p><p><span
  m="215060">Sorry, okay.</span></p><p><span m="216660">I'm sorry that's on the
  tape.</span></p><p><span m="221320">And, of course, on the other side we
  should really just check -- on the other side I have</span> <span m="226460">B
  inverse,</span> <span m="227480">A inverse. That does multiply A B, and this
  time it's these guys that give the identity,</span> <span m="234099">squeeze
  down, they give the identity, we're in shape.</span></p><p><span
  m="238040">Okay. So there's the inverse.</span></p><p><span m="241700">Good.
  While we're at it, let me do a transpose, because the next lecture has got a
  lot to</span> <span m="248480">-- involves transposes.</span></p><p><span
  m="249780">So how do I -- if I transpose a matrix, I'm talking about square,
  invertible matrices</span> <span m="256860">right now.</span></p><p><span
  m="258300">If I transpose one, what's its inverse?</span></p><p><span
  m="263500">Well, the nice formula is -- let's see.</span></p><p><span
  m="267640">Let me start from A, A inverse equal the
  identity.</span></p><p><span m="274760">And let me transpose both
  sides.</span></p><p><span m="279790">That will bring a transpose into the
  picture.</span></p><p><span m="283199">So if I transpose the identity matrix,
  what do I have?</span></p><p><span m="288300">The identity,
  right?</span></p><p><span m="289600">If I exchange rows and columns, the
  identity is a symmetric matrix.</span></p><p><span m="294990">It doesn't know
  the difference.</span></p><p><span m="296940">If I transpose these guys, that
  product, then again it turns out that I have to reverse</span> <span
  m="307780">the order.</span></p><p><span m="309160">I can transpose them
  separately, but when I multiply, those transposes come in the opposite</span>
  <span m="315260">order.</span></p><p><span m="316220">So it's A inverse
  transpose times A transpose giving the identity.</span></p><p><span
  m="323600">So that's -- this equation is -- just comes directly from
  that</span> <span m="326700">one. But this equation tells me what I wanted to
  know, namely what is the inverse of this</span> <span m="332690">guy A
  transpose?</span></p><p><span m="335700">What's the inverse of that -- if I
  transpose a matrix, what'ss the inverse of the result?</span></p><p><span
  m="343180">And this equation tells me that here it is.</span></p><p><span
  m="347000">This is the inverse of A transpose.</span></p><p><span
  m="356659">Inverse of A transpose.</span></p><p><span m="362220">Of A
  transpose.</span></p><p><span m="368100">So I'll put a big circle around that,
  because that's the answer, that's the best answer</span> <span m="373480">we
  could hope for.</span></p><p><span m="376560">That if you want to know the
  inverse of A transpose and you know the inverse of A, then</span> <span
  m="384640">you just transpose that.</span></p><p><span m="386640">So in a --
  to put it another way, transposing and inversing you can do in either order
  for</span> <span m="393790">a single matrix.</span></p><p><span
  m="395390">Okay. So these are like basic facts that we can now use, all right
  -- so now I put it</span> <span m="402770">to use.</span></p><p><span
  m="404920">I put it to use by thinking -- we're really completing, the subject
  of elimination.</span></p><p><span m="412980">Actually, -- the thing about
  elimination is it's the right way to understand what the</span> <span
  m="425930">matrix has got.</span></p><p><span m="426930">This A equal L U is
  the most basic factorization of a matrix.</span></p><p><span m="435550">I
  always worry that you will think this course is all
  elimination.</span></p><p><span m="443960">It's just row
  operations.</span></p><p><span m="447100">And please don't.</span></p><p><span
  m="449420">We'll be beyond that, but it's the right algebra to do
  first.</span></p><p><span m="461120">Okay. So, now I'm coming near the end of
  it, but I want to get it in a decent form.</span></p><p><span m="468630">So my
  decent form is matrix form.</span></p><p><span m="472270">I have a matrix A,
  let's suppose it's a good matrix, I can do elimination, no row
  exchanges</span> <span m="479360">-- So no row exchanges for
  now.</span></p><p><span m="483220">Pivots all fine, nothing zero in the pivot
  position.</span></p><p><span m="487640">I get to the very end, which is
  U.</span></p><p><span m="490240">So I get from A to U.</span></p><p><span
  m="492000">And I want to know what's the connection?</span></p><p><span
  m="495220">How is A related to U?</span></p><p><span m="497690">And this is
  going to tell me that there's a matrix L that connects
  them.</span></p><p><span m="501991">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="503000">Can I
  do it for a two by two first?</span></p><p><span m="508700">Okay. Two by two,
  elimination.</span></p><p><span m="512679">Okay, so I'll do it under
  here.</span></p><p><span m="517186">Okay. So let my matrix A be -- We'll keep
  it simple, say two and an eight, so we know</span> <span m="526680">that the
  first pivot is a two, and the multiplier's going to be a four and then let me
  put a one</span> <span m="534029">here and what number do I not want to put
  there?</span></p><p><span m="538720">Four. I don't want a four there, because
  in that case, the second pivot would not -- we</span> <span
  m="545780">wouldn't have a second pivot.</span></p><p><span m="547642">The
  matrix would be singular, general screw-up. Okay.</span></p><p><span
  m="551360">So let me put some other number here like seven.</span></p><p><span
  m="555090">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="556580">Okay. Now I want to operate on
  that with my elementary matrix.</span></p><p><span m="564680">So what's the
  elementary matrix?</span></p><p><span m="568340">Strictly speaking, it's E21,
  because it's the guy that's going to produce a zero in</span> <span
  m="574560">that position.</span></p><p><span m="575560">And it's going to
  produce U in one shot, because it's just a two by two
  matrix.</span></p><p><span m="583310">So two one and I'm going to take four of
  those away from those, produce that zero and leave</span> <span m="590150">a
  three there.</span></p><p><span m="591580">And that's U.</span></p><p><span
  m="593080">And what's the matrix that did it?</span></p><p><span
  m="595140">Quick review, then.</span></p><p><span m="596900">What's the
  elimination elementary matrix E21 -- it's one zero, thanks.</span></p><p><span
  m="603060">And -- negative four one,</span> <span m="605760">right.
  Good.</span></p><p><span m="607880">Okay. So that -- you see the difference
  between this and what I'm shooting for.</span></p><p><span m="614100">I'm
  shooting for A on one side and the other matrices on the other side of the
  equation.</span></p><p><span m="621990">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="622990">So
  I can do that right away.</span></p><p><span m="625940">Now here's going to be
  my A equals L U.</span></p><p><span m="629500">And you won't have any trouble
  telling me what -- so A is still two one eight seven.</span></p><p><span
  m="638160">L is what you're going to tell me and U is still two one zero
  three.</span></p><p><span m="644940">Okay. So what's L in this
  case?</span></p><p><span m="649800">Well, first -- so how is L related to this
  E guy?</span></p><p><span m="657220">It's the inverse, because I want to
  multiply through by the inverse of this, which will</span> <span
  m="662650">put the identity here, and the inverse will show up there and I'll
  call it L.</span></p><p><span m="668570">So what is the inverse of
  this?</span></p><p><span m="671360">Remember those elimination matrices are
  easy to invert.</span></p><p><span m="677650">The inverse matrix for this one
  is 1 0 4 1, it has the plus sign because it adds back</span> <span
  m="690130">what this removes.</span></p><p><span m="692200">Okay. Do you want
  -- if we did the numbers right, we must -- this should be
  correct.</span></p><p><span m="699860">Okay. And of course it
  is.</span></p><p><span m="702390">That says the first row's right, four times
  the first row plus the second row is eight</span> <span m="707730">seven.
  Good. Okay.</span></p><p><span m="709720">That's simple, two by
  two.</span></p><p><span m="711920">But it already shows the form that we're
  headed for.</span></p><p><span m="717390">It shows -- so what's the L stand
  for?</span></p><p><span m="721190">Why the letter L?</span></p><p><span
  m="722640">If U stood for upper triangular, then of course L stands for lower
  triangular.</span></p><p><span m="729860">And actually, it has ones on the
  diagonal, where this thing has the pivots on the diagonal.</span></p><p><span
  m="736920">Oh, sometimes we may want to separate out the pivots, so can I just
  mention that sometimes</span> <span m="747089">we could also write this as --
  we could have this one zero four one -- I'll just show you</span> <span
  m="754340">how I would divide out this matrix of pivots -- two
  three.</span></p><p><span m="759160">There's a diagonal
  matrix.</span></p><p><span m="761880">And I just -- whatever is left is
  here.</span></p><p><span m="765980">Now what's left?</span></p><p><span
  m="769630">If I divide this first row by two to pull out the two, then I have
  a one and a one half.</span></p><p><span m="777140">And if I divide the second
  row by three to pull out the three, then I have a one.</span></p><p><span
  m="782580">So if this is L U, this is maybe called L D or pivot
  U.</span></p><p><span m="791180">And now it's a little more balanced, because
  we have ones on the diagonal here and here.</span></p><p><span m="801100">And
  the diagonal matrix in the middle.</span></p><p><span m="802920">So both of
  those...</span></p><p><span m="804380">Matlab would produce either
  one.</span></p><p><span m="809400">I'll basically stay with L
  U.</span></p><p><span m="812860">Okay. Now I have to think about bigger than
  two by two.</span></p><p><span m="819960">But right now, this was just like
  easy exercise.</span></p><p><span m="823780">And, to tell the truth, this one
  was a minus sign and this one was a plus sign.</span></p><p><span m="830920">I
  mean, that's the only difference.</span></p><p><span m="834740">But, with
  three by three, there's a more significant difference.</span></p><p><span
  m="842700">Let me show you how that works.</span></p><p><span m="845740">Let
  me move up to a three by three, let's say some matrix A,
  okay?</span></p><p><span m="857760">Let's imagine it's three by
  three.</span></p><p><span m="860130">I won't write numbers down for
  now.</span></p><p><span m="863050">So what's the first elimination step that I
  do, the first matrix I multiply it by, what</span> <span m="869351">letter
  will I use for</span> <span m="870870">that? It'll be E two one, because it's
  -- the first step will be to get a zero in that two</span> <span
  m="881490">one position. right?</span></p><p><span m="883520">And then the
  next step will be to get a zero in the three one position.</span></p><p><span
  m="888260">And the final step will be to get a zero in the three two</span>
  <span m="893560">That's what elimination is, and it produced U.
  position.</span></p><p><span m="897089">And again, no row
  exchanges.</span></p><p><span m="906820">I'm taking the nice case, now, the
  typical case, too -- when I don't have to do any row</span> <span
  m="913180">exchange, all I do is these elimination steps.</span></p><p><span
  m="915920">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="916900">Now, suppose I want that stuff
  over on the right-hand side, as I really do.</span></p><p><span
  m="922880">That's, like, my point here.</span></p><p><span m="925470">I can
  multiply these together to get a matrix E, but I want it over on the
  right.</span></p><p><span m="930300">I want its inverse over
  there.</span></p><p><span m="933670">So what's the right expression
  now?</span></p><p><span m="939160">If I write A and U, what goes
  there?</span></p><p><span m="946440">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="947060">So
  I've got the inverse of this, I've got three matrices in</span> <span
  m="950040">a row now.</span></p><p><span m="952020">And it's their inverses
  that are going to show up, because each one is easy to
  invert.</span></p><p><span m="958300">Question is, what about the whole
  bunch?</span></p><p><span m="961460">How easy is it to invert the whole
  bunch?</span></p><p><span m="964780">So, that's what we know how to
  do.</span></p><p><span m="968630">We know how to invert, we should take the
  separate inverses, but they go in the opposite</span> <span
  m="972840">order.</span></p><p><span m="973840">So what goes
  here?</span></p><p><span m="975800">E three two inverse, right, because I'll
  multiply from the left by E three two inverse, then</span> <span
  m="981640">I'll pop it up next to U.</span></p><p><span m="986600">And then
  will come E three one inverse.</span></p><p><span m="990880">And then this'll
  be the only guy left standing and that's gone when I do an E two one
  inverse.</span></p><p><span m="1000910">So there is L.</span></p><p><span
  m="1003590">That's L U.</span></p><p><span m="1007300">L is product of
  inverses.</span></p><p><span m="1010860">Now you still can ask why is this guy
  preferring inverses?</span></p><p><span m="1017680">And let me explain
  why.</span></p><p><span m="1019570">Let me explain why is this product nicer
  than this one?</span></p><p><span m="1025619">This product turns out to be
  better than this one.</span></p><p><span m="1030380">Let me take a typical
  case here.</span></p><p><span m="1035060">Let me take a typical
  case.</span></p><p><span m="1037250">So let me -- I have to do three by three
  for you to see the improvement.</span></p><p><span m="1043000">Two by two, it
  was just one E, no problem.</span></p><p><span m="1047400">But let me go up to
  this case.</span></p><p><span m="1049960">Suppose my matrices E21 -- suppose
  E21 has a minus two in there.</span></p><p><span m="1061460">Suppose that --
  and now suppose -- oh, I'll even suppose E31 is the
  identity.</span></p><p><span m="1069840">I'm going to make the point with just
  a couple of these.</span></p><p><span m="1074360">Okay.</span></p><p><span
  m="1074900">Now this guy will have -- do something -- now let's suppose minus
  five one.</span></p><p><span m="1082720">Okay. There's
  typical.</span></p><p><span m="1087560">That's a typical case in which we
  didn't need an E31. Maybe we already had a zero in that</span> <span
  m="1092760">three one position.</span></p><p><span
  m="1094660">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="1097560">Let me see -- is that going
  to be enough to, show my point?</span></p><p><span m="1104700">Let me do that
  multiplication.</span></p><p><span m="1109500">So if I do that multiplication
  it's like good practice to</span> <span m="1112640">multiply these
  matrices.</span></p><p><span m="1115000">Tell me what's above the diagonal
  when I do this multiplication?</span></p><p><span m="1119900">All zeroes. When
  I do this multiplication, I'm going to get ones on the diagonal and</span>
  <span m="1124500">zeroes above.</span></p><p><span m="1128280">Because -- what
  does that say?</span></p><p><span m="1130140">That says that I'm subtracting
  rows from lower rows.</span></p><p><span m="1134549">So nothing is moving
  upwards as it did last time in Gauss-Jordan. Okay.</span></p><p><span
  m="1140970">Now -- so really, what I have to do is check this minus two one
  zero, now this is -- what's</span> <span m="1150280">that
  number?</span></p><p><span m="1151240">This is the number that I'm really have
  in mind.</span></p><p><span m="1155740">That number is ten.</span></p><p><span
  m="1159900">And this one is -- what goes here?</span></p><p><span
  m="1165620">Row three against column two, it looks like the minus
  five.</span></p><p><span m="1172000">What &ndash; it's that
  ten.</span></p><p><span m="1175100">How did that ten get in
  there?</span></p><p><span m="1177020">I don't like that
  ten.</span></p><p><span m="1179040">I mean -- of course, I don't want to erase
  it, because it's right.</span></p><p><span m="1182220">But I don't want it
  there.</span></p><p><span m="1185840">It's because -- the ten got in there
  because I subtracted two of row one from row two,</span> <span m="1193800">and
  then I subtracted five of that new row two from row three.</span></p><p><span
  m="1198760">So doing it in that order, how did row one effect row
  three?</span></p><p><span m="1204920">Well, it did, because two of it got
  removed from row two and then five of those got removed</span> <span
  m="1210480">from row three.</span></p><p><span m="1211590">So altogether ten
  of row one got thrown into row three.</span></p><p><span m="1217800">Now my
  point is in the reverse direction -- so now I can do it -- below it I'll do
  the inverses.</span></p><p><span m="1227540">Okay.</span></p><p><span
  m="1228100">And, of course, opposite order.</span></p><p><span
  m="1229820">Reverse order.</span></p><p><span m="1231660">Reverse
  order.</span></p><p><span m="1235960">Okay. So now this is going to -- this is
  the E that goes on the left side.</span></p><p><span m="1244020">Left of
  A.</span></p><p><span m="1247790">Now I'm going to do the inverses in the
  opposite order, so what's the -- So the opposite order</span> <span
  m="1254340">means I put this inverse first.</span></p><p><span m="1257530">And
  what is its inverse?</span></p><p><span m="1258890">What's the inverse of E21?
  Same thing with a plus sign, right?</span></p><p><span m="1264660">For the
  individual matrices, instead of taking away two I add back two of row one to
  row</span> <span m="1272730">two, so no problem.</span></p><p><span
  m="1276620">And now, in reverse order, I want to invert
  that.</span></p><p><span m="1281400">Just right?</span></p><p><span
  m="1282840">I'm doing just this, this.</span></p><p><span m="1285540">So now
  the inverse is again the same thing, but add in the five.</span></p><p><span
  m="1296320">And now I'll do that multiplication and I'll get a happy
  result.</span></p><p><span m="1305460">I hope.</span></p><p><span
  m="1307800">Did I do it right so far?</span></p><p><span m="1310220">Yes,
  okay.</span></p><p><span m="1310960">Let me do the
  multiplication.</span></p><p><span m="1311650">I believe this comes
  out.</span></p><p><span m="1313350">So row one of the answer is one zero
  zero.</span></p><p><span m="1316660">Oh, I know that all this is going to be
  left,</span> <span m="1319300">right? Then I have two one
  zero.</span></p><p><span m="1324090">So I get two one zero there,
  right?</span></p><p><span m="1327560">And what's the third
  row?</span></p><p><span m="1330060">What's the third row in this
  product?</span></p><p><span m="1335160">Just read it out to me, the third
  row?</span></p><p><span m="1338640">0 5 1</span> <span m="1342980">Because one
  way to say is &ndash; this is saying take one of the</span> <span
  m="1347240">last row and there it is.</span></p><p><span m="1349640">And this
  is my matrix L.</span></p><p><span m="1352590">And it's the one that goes on
  the left of U.</span></p><p><span m="1358450">It goes into -- what do I mean
  here?</span></p><p><span m="1365190">Maybe rather than saying left of A, left
  of U, let me right down again what I mean.</span></p><p><span m="1372040">E A
  is U, whereas A is L U.</span></p><p><span
  m="1378600">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="1381560">Let me make the point now in
  words.</span></p><p><span m="1386300">The order that the matrices come for L
  is the right order.</span></p><p><span m="1391090">The two and the five don't
  sort of interfere to produce this ten one. In the</span> <span
  m="1401800">right order, the multipliers just sit in the matrix
  L.</span></p><p><span m="1406919">That's the point -- that if I want to know
  L, I have no work to do.</span></p><p><span m="1415530">I just keep a record
  of what those multipliers were, and that gives me L.</span></p><p><span
  m="1421370">So I'll draw the -- let me say it.</span></p><p><span
  m="1432610">So this is the A=L U.</span></p><p><span m="1436320">So if no row
  exchanges, the multipliers that those numbers that we multiplied rows by
  and</span> <span m="1454010">subtracted, when we did an elimination step --
  the multipliers go directly into L.</span></p><p><span
  m="1467550">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="1469950">So L is -- this is the way,
  to look at elimination.</span></p><p><span m="1482770">You go through the
  elimination steps, and actually if you do it right, you can throw</span> <span
  m="1491510">away A as you create L U.</span></p><p><span m="1497120">If you
  think about it, those steps of elimination, as when you've finished with row
  two of A,</span> <span m="1508520">you've created a new row two of U, which
  you have to save, and you've created the multipliers</span> <span
  m="1516540">that you used -- which you have to save, and then you can forget
  A.</span></p><p><span m="1522980">So because it's all there in L and
  U.</span></p><p><span m="1525919">So that's -- this moment is maybe the new
  insight in elimination that comes from matrix</span> <span m="1541580">--
  doing it in matrix form.</span></p><p><span m="1544070">So it was -- the
  product of Es is -- we can't see what that product of Es
  is.</span></p><p><span m="1552350">The matrix E is not a particularly
  attractive one.</span></p><p><span m="1556350">What's great is when we put
  them on the other side -- their inverses in the opposite order,</span> <span
  m="1562130">there the L comes out just right. Okay.</span></p><p><span
  m="1566210">Now -- oh gosh, so today's a sort of,</span> <span
  m="1569580">like, practical day.</span></p><p><span m="1574160">Can we think
  together how expensive is elimination?</span></p><p><span m="1580670">How many
  operations do we do?</span></p><p><span m="1584570">So this is now a kind of
  new topic which I didn't list as -- on the program, but here</span> <span
  m="1592540">it came. Here it comes.</span></p><p><span m="1594980">How many
  operations on an n by n matrix A.</span></p><p><span m="1615780">I mean, it's
  a very practical question.</span></p><p><span m="1618020">Can we solve systems
  of order a thousand, in a second or a minute or a week?</span></p><p><span
  m="1628280">Can we solve systems of order a million in a second or an hour or
  a week?</span></p><p><span m="1636460">I mean, what's the -- if it's n by n,
  we often want to take n bigger.</span></p><p><span m="1645059">I mean, we've
  put in more information.</span></p><p><span m="1648700">We make the whole
  thing is more accurate for the bigger matrix.</span></p><p><span
  m="1653880">But it's more expensive, too, and the question is how much more
  expensive?</span></p><p><span m="1659000">If I have matrices of order a
  hundred.</span></p><p><span m="1661679">Let's say a hundred by a
  hundred.</span></p><p><span m="1663150">Let me take n to be a
  hundred.</span></p><p><span m="1667660">Say n equal a
  hundred.</span></p><p><span m="1670840">How many steps are we
  doing?</span></p><p><span m="1674860">How many operations are we actually
  doing that we -- And let's suppose there aren't</span> <span m="1682770">any
  zeroes, because of course if a matrix has got a lot of zeroes in good places,
  we</span> <span m="1687800">don't have to do those operations, and,</span>
  <span m="1689870">it'll be much faster.</span></p><p><span m="1693500">But --
  so just think for a moment about the first step.</span></p><p><span
  m="1701940">So here's our matrix A, hundred by a hundred.</span></p><p><span
  m="1707180">And the first step will be -- that column, is got zeroes
  down</span> <span m="1714880">here. So it's down to 99 by 99,
  right?</span></p><p><span m="1721080">That's really like the first stage of
  elimination,</span> <span m="1725920">to get from this hundred</span> <span
  m="1728490">by hundred non-zero matrix to this stage where the first pivot is
  sitting up here and the</span> <span m="1735600">first row's okay the first
  column is okay.</span></p><p><span m="1739440">So, eventually -- how many
  steps did that take?</span></p><p><span m="1745120">You see, I'm trying to get
  an idea.</span></p><p><span m="1747409">Is the answer proportional to
  n?</span></p><p><span m="1751860">Is the total number of steps in elimination,
  the total number, is it proportional to n</span> <span m="1757260">-- in which
  case if I double n from a hundred to two hundred -- does it take me twice
  as</span> <span m="1762520">long?</span></p><p><span m="1764140">Does it
  square, so it would take me four times as long?</span></p><p><span
  m="1767350">Does it cube so it would take me eight times as
  long?</span></p><p><span m="1770600">Or is it n factorial, so it would take me
  a hundred times as long?</span></p><p><span m="1777120">I think, you know,
  from a practical point of view, we have to have some idea of the</span> <span
  m="1781560">cost, here.</span></p><p><span m="1784280">So these are the
  questions that I'm -- let me ask those questions again.</span></p><p><span
  m="1788720">Is it proportional -- does it go like n, like n squared, like n
  cubed -- or some higher</span> <span m="1794900">power of
  n?</span></p><p><span m="1796420">Like n factorial where every step up
  multiplies by a hundred and then by a hundred and one</span> <span
  m="1804580">and then by a hundred and two -- which is it?</span></p><p><span
  m="1807980">Okay, so that's the only way I know to answer that is to think
  through what we actually</span> <span m="1814320">had to
  do.</span></p><p><span m="1816100">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="1817100">So
  what was the cost here?</span></p><p><span m="1822680">Well, let's
  see.</span></p><p><span m="1823309">What do I mean by an
  operation?</span></p><p><span m="1825700">I guess I mean, well an addition or
  -- yeah.</span></p><p><span m="1832549">No big deal.</span></p><p><span
  m="1833549">I guess I mean an addition or a subtraction or a multiplication or
  a division.</span></p><p><span m="1838980">Okay.</span></p><p><span
  m="1841540">And actually, what operation I doing all the
  time?</span></p><p><span m="1848980">When I multiply row one by multiplier L
  and I subtract from row six.</span></p><p><span m="1858870">What's happening
  there individually?</span></p><p><span m="1861060">What's going
  on?</span></p><p><span m="1863460">If I multiply -- I do a multiplication by L
  and then a subtraction.</span></p><p><span m="1868490">So I guess operation --
  Can I count that for the moment as, like, one operation?</span></p><p><span
  m="1875610">Or you may want to count them separately.</span></p><p><span
  m="1878520">The typical operation is multiply plus a
  subtract.</span></p><p><span m="1886740">So if I count those together, my
  answer's going to come out</span> <span m="1891420">half as many as if -- I
  mean, if I count them separately, I'd have a certain</span> <span
  m="1896540">number of multiplies, certain number of
  subtracts.</span></p><p><span m="1899000">That's really want to
  do.</span></p><p><span m="1900580">Okay. How many have I got
  here?</span></p><p><span m="1903360">So, I think -- let's
  see.</span></p><p><span m="1909500">It's about -- well, how many,
  roughly?</span></p><p><span m="1916293">How many operations to get from here
  to here?</span></p><p><span m="1919360">Well, maybe one way to look at it is
  all these numbers had to get changed.</span></p><p><span m="1925800">The first
  row didn't get changed, but all the other rows got changed at this
  step.</span></p><p><span m="1931900">So this step -- well, I guess maybe --
  shall I say it cost about a hundred squared.</span></p><p><span m="1945880">I
  mean, if I had changed the first row, then it would have been exactly hundred
  squared,</span> <span m="1952110">because -- because that's how many numbers
  are here.</span></p><p><span m="1955549">A hundred squared numbers is the
  total count of the entry, and all but this insignificant</span> <span
  m="1962279">first row got changed.</span></p><p><span m="1964300">So I would
  say about a hundred squared.</span></p><p><span
  m="1967660">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="1968620">Now, what about the next
  step?</span></p><p><span m="1974150">So now the first row is
  fine.</span></p><p><span m="1976960">The second row is
  fine.</span></p><p><span m="1980020">And I'm changing these zeroes are all
  fine, so what's up with the second step?</span></p><p><span m="1986700">And
  then you're with me.</span></p><p><span m="1988620">Roughly, what's the
  cost?</span></p><p><span m="1990390">If this first step cost a hundred
  squared, about, operations then this one, which is</span> <span
  m="1997330">really working on this guy to produce this, costs about
  what?</span></p><p><span m="2007490">How many operations to
  fix?</span></p><p><span m="2011250">About ninety-nine squared, or ninety-nine
  times ninety-eight. But less, right?</span></p><p><span m="2016610">Less,
  because our problem's getting smaller.</span></p><p><span m="2019590">About
  ninety-nine squared.</span></p><p><span m="2022280">And then I go down and
  down and the next one will be ninety-eight squared, the next
  ninety-seven</span> <span m="2026160">squared and finally I'm down around one
  squared or -- where it's just like the little numbers.</span></p><p><span
  m="2033750">The big numbers are here.</span></p><p><span m="2035890">So the
  number of operations is about n squared plus that was n, right? n was a
  hundred?</span></p><p><span m="2046190">n squared for the first step, then n
  minus one squared, then n minus two squared, finally</span> <span
  m="2053589">down to three squared and two squared and even one
  squared.</span></p><p><span m="2063040">No way I should have written that --
  squeezed that in.</span></p><p><span m="2067929">Let me try it so the count is
  n squared plus n minus one squared plus -- all the way down</span> <span
  m="2077570">to one squared.</span></p><p><span m="2081980">That's a pretty
  decent count.</span></p><p><span m="2084899">Admittedly, we didn't catch every
  single tiny operation, but we got the right leading term</span> <span
  m="2096040">here.</span></p><p><span m="2097040">And what do those add up
  to?</span></p><p><span m="2101180">Okay, so now we're coming to the punch of
  this, question, this operation count.</span></p><p><span m="2110030">So the
  operations on the left side, on the matrix A to finally get to
  U.</span></p><p><span m="2119820">And anybody -- so which of these quantities
  is the right ballpark for that count?</span></p><p><span m="2128540">If I add
  a hundred squared to ninety nine squared to ninety eight squared --
  ninety</span> <span m="2134080">seven squared, all the way down to two squared
  then one squared, what have I got, about?</span></p><p><span m="2144020">It's
  just one of these -- let's identify it first.</span></p><p><span
  m="2148100">Is it n?</span></p><p><span m="2149020">Certainly
  not.</span></p><p><span m="2152080">Is it n factorial?</span></p><p><span
  m="2155700">No.</span></p><p><span m="2156460">If it was n factorial, we would
  -- with determinants, it is n factorial.</span></p><p><span m="2162020">I'll
  put in a bad mark against determinants, because that -- okay, so what is
  it?</span></p><p><span m="2172400">It's n -- well, this is the
  answer.</span></p><p><span m="2178580">It's this order -- n
  cubed.</span></p><p><span m="2181240">It's like I have n terms,
  right?</span></p><p><span m="2186380">I've got n terms in this
  sum.</span></p><p><span m="2188690">And the biggest one is n
  squared.</span></p><p><span m="2191140">So the worst it could be would be n
  cubed, but it's not as bad as -- it's n cubed times</span> <span
  m="2200750">-- it's about one third of n cubed.</span></p><p><span
  m="2205270">That's the magic operation count.</span></p><p><span
  m="2213690">Somehow that one third takes account of the fact that the numbers
  are getting smaller.</span></p><p><span m="2222339">If they weren't getting
  smaller, we would have n terms times n squared, but it would</span> <span
  m="2226900">be exactly n cubed.</span></p><p><span m="2228240">But our numbers
  are getting smaller -- actually, row two and row one moves down to row
  three.</span></p><p><span m="2230640">do you remember where does one third
  come in this -- I'll even allow a mention of calculus.</span></p><p><span
  m="2239400">So calculus can be mentioned, integration can be mentioned now in
  the next minute and</span> <span m="2245940">not again for
  weeks.</span></p><p><span m="2248360">It's not that I don't like 18.01,
  but18.06 is better.</span></p><p><span m="2253440">Okay. So, -- so what's --
  what's the calculus formula that looks like?</span></p><p><span m="2262350">It
  looks like -- if we were in calculus instead of summing stuff, we would
  integrate.</span></p><p><span m="2270589">So I would integrate x squared and I
  would get one third x</span> <span m="2276800">cubed. So if that was like an
  integral from one to n, of x squared b x, if the answer</span> <span
  m="2287430">would be one third n cubed -- and it's correct for the sum also,
  because that's, like, the</span> <span m="2293690">whole point of
  calculus.</span></p><p><span m="2294900">The whole point of calculus is -- oh,
  I don't want to tell you the whole -- I mean, you</span> <span
  m="2299315">know the whole point of calculus.</span></p><p><span
  m="2301280">Calculus is like sums except it's continuous.</span></p><p><span
  m="2307990">Okay. And algebra is discreet.</span></p><p><span
  m="2311950">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="2312950">So the answer is one third n
  cubed.</span></p><p><span m="2315010">Now I'll just -- let me say one more
  thing about operations.</span></p><p><span m="2320080">What about the
  right-hand side?</span></p><p><span m="2321920">This was what it cost on the
  left side.</span></p><p><span m="2325250">This is on A.</span></p><p><span
  m="2330380">Because this is A that we're working with.</span></p><p><span
  m="2332180">But what's the cost on the extra column vector b that we're
  hanging around here?</span></p><p><span m="2340660">So b costs a lot less,
  obviously, because it's just one column.</span></p><p><span m="2347570">We
  carry it through elimination and then actually we do back
  substitution.</span></p><p><span m="2354260">Let me just tell you the answer
  there.</span></p><p><span m="2356160">It's n squared.</span></p><p><span
  m="2358420">So the cost for every right hand side is n
  squared.</span></p><p><span m="2363220">So let me -- I'll just fit that in
  here -- for the cost of b turns out to be n squared.</span></p><p><span
  m="2377000">So you see if we have, as we often have, a a matrix A and several
  right-hand sides, then</span> <span m="2389580">we pay the price on A, the
  higher price on A to get it split up into L and U to do elimination</span>
  <span m="2397670">on A, but then we can process every right-hand side at low
  cost.</span></p><p><span m="2402810">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="2403860">So
  the -- We really have discussed the most fundamental algorithm for a system of
  equations.</span></p><p><span m="2416560">Okay.</span></p><p><span
  m="2419700">So, I'm ready to allow row exchanges.</span></p><p><span
  m="2429500">I'm ready to allow -- now what happens to this whole -- today's
  lecture if there are</span> <span m="2434220">row
  exchanges?</span></p><p><span m="2438400">When would there be row
  exchanges?</span></p><p><span m="2442240">There are row -- we need to do row
  exchanges if a zero shows up in the pivot position.</span></p><p><span
  m="2447840">So moving then into the final section of this chapter, which is
  about transposes -- well,</span> <span m="2455820">we've already seen some
  transposes, and -- the title of this section is,</span> <span
  m="2468640">&quot;Transposes and Permutations.&quot;</span> <span
  m="2473700">Okay. So can I say, now, where does a permutation come
  in?</span></p><p><span m="2481160">Let me talk a little about
  permutations.</span></p><p><span m="2483300">So that'll be up here,
  permutations.</span></p><p><span m="2494620">So these are the matrices that I
  need to do row exchanges.</span></p><p><span m="2501420">And I may have to do
  two row exchanges.</span></p><p><span m="2504560">Can you invent a matrix
  where I would have to do two row exchanges and then would come</span> <span
  m="2512320">out fine?</span></p><p><span m="2514180">Yeah let's just, for the
  heck of it -- so I'll put it here.</span></p><p><span m="2521460">Let me do
  three by threes.</span></p><p><span m="2524120">Actually, why don't I just
  plain list all the three by three permutation matrices.</span></p><p><span
  m="2530480">There're a nice little group of them.</span></p><p><span
  m="2533010">What are all the matrices that exchange no rows at
  all?</span></p><p><span m="2540880">Well, I'll include the
  identity.</span></p><p><span m="2546070">So that's a permutation matrix that
  doesn't do anything.</span></p><p><span m="2549710">Now what's the permutation
  matrix that exchanges -- what is P12? The permutation matrix that</span> <span
  m="2558680">exchanges rows one and two would be -- 0 1 0 -- 1 0 0,
  right.</span></p><p><span m="2568540">I just exchanged those rows of the
  identity and I've got it.</span></p><p><span m="2573360">Okay. Actually, I'll
  -- yes.</span></p><p><span m="2576080">Let me clutter this
  up.</span></p><p><span m="2581840">Okay. Give me a complete list of all the
  row exchange matrices.</span></p><p><span m="2586340">So what are
  they?</span></p><p><span m="2587540">They're all the ways I can take the
  identity matrix and rearrange its rows.</span></p><p><span m="2593780">How
  many will there be?</span></p><p><span m="2596620">How many three by three
  permutation matrices?</span></p><p><span m="2601820">Shall we keep going and
  get the answer?</span></p><p><span m="2604100">So tell me some
  more.</span></p><p><span m="2607500">STUDENT: Zero one &ndash;</span> <span
  m="2608580">STRANG: Zero &ndash; What one are you going to do
  now?</span></p><p><span m="2611000">STUDENT: I'm going to switch the
  &ndash;</span> <span m="2612840">STRANG: Switch rows one and -- One and three,
  okay. One and three, leaving two alone.</span></p><p><span
  m="2623520">Okay.</span></p><p><span m="2624460">Now what else? Switch -- what
  would be the next easy one -- is switch two and</span> <span
  m="2630780">three, good. So I'll leave one zero zero alone and I'll switch --
  I'll move number three</span> <span m="2637250">up and number two
  down.</span></p><p><span m="2640329">Okay. Those are the ones that just
  exchange single -- a pair of</span> <span m="2645380">rows. This guy, this guy
  and this guy exchanges a pair of rows, but now there are more
  possibilities.</span></p><p><span m="2653340">What's left?</span></p><p><span
  m="2656080">So tell -- there is another one here.</span></p><p><span
  m="2659640">What's that?</span></p><p><span m="2662260">It's going to move --
  it's going to change all rows, right?</span></p><p><span m="2666440">Where
  shall we put them?</span></p><p><span m="2668160">So -- give me a first
  row.</span></p><p><span m="2669780">STUDENT: Zero one zero?</span></p><p><span
  m="2670800">STRANG: Zero one zero.</span></p><p><span m="2672740">Okay, now a
  second row -- say zero zero one and the third guy</span> <span m="2678000">One
  zero zero.</span></p><p><span m="2681960">So that is like a
  cycle.</span></p><p><span m="2684420">That puts row two moves up to row one,
  row three moves up to</span> <span m="2689800">row two and row one moves down
  to row three.</span></p><p><span m="2693420">And there's one more, which is --
  let's see.</span></p><p><span m="2700180">What's left?</span></p><p><span
  m="2703280">I'm lost.</span></p><p><span m="2704160">STUDENT: Is it zero zero
  one?</span></p><p><span m="2705240">STRANG: Is it zero zero one?
  Okay.</span></p><p><span m="2706780">STUDENT: One zero
  zero.</span></p><p><span m="2708120">STRANG: One zero zero,
  okay.</span></p><p><span m="2711260">Zero one zero, okay.</span></p><p><span
  m="2716460">Great.</span></p><p><span m="2717980">Six. Six of
  them.</span></p><p><span m="2721780">Six P. And they're sort of nice, because
  what happens if I write, multiply two of them together?</span></p><p><span
  m="2735580">If I multiply two of these matrices together, what can you tell me
  about the answer?</span></p><p><span m="2742100">It's on the
  list.</span></p><p><span m="2744360">If I do some row exchanges and then I do
  some more row exchanges, then all together I've</span> <span m="2749220">done
  row exchanges.</span></p><p><span m="2750520">So if I multiply -- but, I don't
  know.</span></p><p><span m="2754520">And if I invert, then I'm just doing row
  exchanges to get back again.</span></p><p><span m="2760349">So the inverses
  are all there.</span></p><p><span m="2761869">It's a little family of matrices
  that -- they've got their own -- if I multiply, I'm still</span> <span
  m="2772790">inside this group.</span></p><p><span m="2774400">If I invert I'm
  inside this group -- actually, group is the right name for this
  subject.</span></p><p><span m="2778920">It's a group of six matrices, and what
  about the inverses?</span></p><p><span m="2784320">What's the inverse of this
  guy, for example?</span></p><p><span m="2788160">What's the inverse -- if I
  exchange rows one and two, what's the inverse matrix?</span></p><p><span
  m="2794700">Just tell me fast.</span></p><p><span m="2796760">The inverse of
  that matrix is -- if I exchange rows one and two, then what I should do
  to</span> <span m="2806910">get back to where I started is the same
  thing.</span></p><p><span m="2811150">So this thing is its own
  inverse.</span></p><p><span m="2814905">That's probably its own
  inverse.</span></p><p><span m="2815905">This is probably not -- actually, I
  think these are inverses of each other.</span></p><p><span m="2820380">Oh,
  yeah, actually -- the inverse is the transpose.</span></p><p><span
  m="2826320">There's a curious fact about permutations matrices, that the
  inverses are the transposes.</span></p><p><span m="2836020">And final moment
  -- how many are there if I -- how many four by four
  permutations?</span></p><p><span m="2841820">So let me take four by four --
  how many Ps?</span></p><p><span m="2849880">Well, okay.</span></p><p><span
  m="2852720">Make a good guess.</span></p><p><span m="2854940">Twenty four,
  right. Twenty four Ps.</span></p><p><span m="2858020">Okay. So, we've got
  these permutation matrices, and in the next lecture, we'll use
  them.</span></p><p><span m="2868820">So the next lecture, finishes Chapter
  2</span> <span m="2871660">and moves to Chapter 3.</span></p><p><span
  m="2875160">Thank you.</span></p>
