  <p>The Girls Who Build Cameras workshop for high school girls is a one-day,
  hands-on introduction to camera physics and technology (i.e. how Instagram
  works!) at the <a href="https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/">MIT Lincoln
  Laboratory Beaverworks Center</a>. The workshop includes tearing down old dSLR
  cameras, building a Raspberry Pi camera, and designing Instagram filters and
  Photoshop tools. Participants also get to listen to keynote speakers from the
  camera technology industry, including Kris Clark who engineers space cameras
  for NASA and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and Uyanga Tsedev who creates imaging
  probes to help surgeons find tumors at MIT. During lunch, representatives from
  the <a href="http://societyofwomenengineers.swe.org/">Society of Women
  Engineers</a> and the <a href="http://wtp.mit.edu/">Women's Technology
  Program</a> at MIT will present future opportunities to get involved in
  engineering in high school and college.</p>
