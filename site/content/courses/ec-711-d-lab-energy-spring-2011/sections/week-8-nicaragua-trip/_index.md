Post-Trip Assignments
---------------------

### Design Challenges

As a team, collaboratively complete design challenge worksheets for all projects identified and supplement them with pictures. Bring the hard copies to class.

### Pictures

As a team, collaboratively sort through your pictures, select the most relevant ones, and organize them into several folders:

*   one folder for _each_ project with the 10-20 most relevant pictures
*   one folder with general trip pictures (about 20-30)
*   one folder that has truly spectacular photos

Upload the pictures onto the D-Lab Flickr account. Add captions to describe each picture. Use the D-Lab India [Avani Charcoal & Stove collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/d-lab/sets/72157623182601149/) as a sample of how to title, caption and attribute credits to photographs.

**Results**: Flickr photo collection of [D-Lab Energy 2011 community partner visits](http://www.flickr.com/photos/d-lab/collections/72157623356103471/)

### Presentation

In the lecture session the week after your trip (lecture #8), each team will give a 10-minute presentation about their trip, and present the top 3-5 ideas for projects. You are welcome to only use pictures for the presentation, so that you don't have to spend time prepping slides. To do so, just create a Flickr folder with the pictures from your presentation.
