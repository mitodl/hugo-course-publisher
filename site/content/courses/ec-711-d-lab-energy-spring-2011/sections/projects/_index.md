During the first seven weeks of class, project work builds incrementally as described in each week's lectures, labs, and assignments. The [Project Work list]({{% getpage "courses/ec-711-d-lab-energy-spring-2011/sections/wind-micro-hydro/_index.md" %}}#Assignments) in Week 5 Assignments summarizes much of that preliminary work.

After the spring break trips, the class focuses intensely on their projects. This page describes the project design process and deliverables starting with Week 9.

Examples of student work can be found on the [Project Results]({{% getpage "courses/ec-711-d-lab-energy-spring-2011/sections/projects/project-results/_index.md" %}}) page.
