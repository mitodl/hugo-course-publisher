course_description: >-
  <p>D-Lab: Energy offers a hands-on, project-based approach that engages
  students in understanding and addressing the applications of small-scale,
  sustainable energy technology in developing countries where compact, robust,
  low-cost systems for generating power are required. Projects may include
  micro-hydro, solar, or wind turbine generators along with theoretical
  analysis, design, prototype construction, evaluation and implementation.
  Students will have the opportunity both to travel to Nicaragua during spring
  break to identify and implement projects.</p> <p>D-Lab: Energy is part of
  MIT's <a href="http://d-lab.mit.edu/">D-Lab program</a>, which fosters the
  development of appropriate technologies and sustainable solutions within the
  framework of international development.</p><p>This course is an elective
  subject in MIT&rsquo;s undergraduate  <a
  href="http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor/">Energy Studies Minor</a>.
  This Institute-wide program complements the deep  expertise obtained in any
  major with a broad understanding of the  interlinked realms of science,
  technology, and social sciences as they  relate to energy and associated
  environmental challenges.</p>
