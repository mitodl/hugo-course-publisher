course_description: >-
  D-Lab: Energy offers a hands-on, project-based approach that engages students
  in understanding and addressing the applications of small-scale, sustainable
  energy technology in developing countries where compact, robust, low-cost
  systems for generating power are required. Projects may include micro-hydro,
  solar, or wind turbine generators along with theoretical analysis, design,
  prototype construction, evaluation and implementation. Students will have the
  opportunity both to travel to Nicaragua during spring break to identify and
  implement projects.


  D-Lab: Energy is part of MIT's [D-Lab program](http://d-lab.mit.edu/), which
  fosters the development of appropriate technologies and sustainable solutions
  within the framework of international development.


  This course is an elective subject in MITâ€™s undergraduate [Energy Studies
  Minor](http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor/). This Institute-wide
  program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major with a broad
  understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and social
  sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.
