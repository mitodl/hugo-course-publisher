title: What Is A Fractal?
transcript: >-
  <p>[MUSIC PLAYING] <br /><br />[SINGING] Science out loud.<br /><br />What do
  snowflakes and cellphones have in common?<br /><br />The answer is never
  ending patterns called fractals.<br /><br />Let me draw a snowflake.<br /><br
  />I'll start with an equilateral triangle.<br /><br />Then I'll draw another
  equilateral triangle on the middle of each side.<br /><br />Pull out the
  middle and repeat the process, this time with 1, 2, 3, 4 times 3, which is 12
  sides.<br /><br />If I do this over and over, the shape will look something
  like this.<br /><br />This is called a Koch snowflake, and it has a special
  property.<br /><br />No matter where I look or how much I zoom in, I will see
  the same pattern over and over.<br /><br />Never ending patterns like this
  that on any scale, on any level of zoom look roughly the same are called
  fractals.<br /><br />We can actually draw a Koch snowflake on the computer by
  having it repeatedly graph a mathematical equation.<br /><br />Each time we
  add a triangle, one side of the Koch snowflake will turn into four.<br /><br
  />After the first repetition, we'll get three times four to the first, or 12
  sides.<br /><br />After the second repetition, we'll get three times four to
  the second, or 48 sides.<br /><br />After repetition number n, we'll have
  three times four to the n sides.<br /><br />If we do this an infinite number
  of times, we'll get infinitely many sides.<br /><br />So the perimeter of the
  Koch snowflake will be infinite.<br /><br />But the area of the Koch snowflake
  wouldn't be infinite.<br /><br />If I draw a circle with a finite area around
  the snowflake, it will fit completely inside no matter how many times we
  increase the number of sides.<br /><br />So the Koch fractal has an infinite
  perimeter, but a finite area.<br /><br />In the 1990s, a radio astronomer
  named Nathan Cohen used the fractal antenna to rethink wireless
  communications.<br /><br />&nbsp;At the time, Cohen's landlord wouldn't let
  him put a radio antenna on his roof, so Cohen decided to make a more compact,
  fractal like radio antenna instead.<br /><br />But it didn't just hide the
  antenna from the landlord.<br /><br />It also seemed to work better than the
  regular ones.<br /><br />Regular antennas have to be cut for one type of
  signal, and they usually work best when their lengths are certain multiples of
  their signals' wavelengths.<br /><br />So FM radio antennas can only pick up
  FM radio stations, TV antennas can only pick up TV channels, and so on.<br
  /><br />But fractal antennas are different.<br /><br />As the fractal repeats
  itself more and more, the fractal antenna can pick up more and more signals,
  not just one.<br /><br />And because the perimeter of the Koch snowflake grows
  way faster than its area, the fractal antenna only takes up a quarter of the
  usual space.<br /><br />But Cohen didn't stop there.<br /><br />He designed a
  new antenna, this time using a fractal called the Menger sponge.<br /><br
  />The Menger sponge is kind of like a 3D version of the Koch snowflake and has
  infinite surface area but finite volume.<br /><br />The Menger sponge is
  sometimes used in cellphone antennas.<br /><br />It can receive all kinds of
  signals while taking up even less area than a Koch snowflake.<br /><br />Now,
  these antennas aren't perfect.<br /><br />They're smaller, but they're also
  very intricate, so they're harder and more expensive to make.<br /><br />And
  though low fractal antennas can receive many different types of signals, they
  can't always receive each signal as well as an antenna that was cut for it.<br
  /><br />Cohen's invention was not the first application of fractals.<br /><br
  />Nature has been doing it forever, and not just with snowflakes.<br /><br
  />You can see fractals in river systems, lightning bolts, seashells, and even
  whole galaxies.<br /><br />So many natural systems previously thought off
  limits to mathematicians can now be explained in terms of fractals, and by
  applying nature's best practices, we can then solve real world problems.<br
  /><br />Fractal research is changing fields such as biology.<br /><br />For
  example, MIT scientists discovered that chromatin is a fractal, and that keeps
  DNA from getting tangled.<br /><br />Look around you.<br /><br />What
  beautiful patterns do you see?<br /><br />Hi.<br /><br />I'm Yulia.<br /><br
  />Thanks for watching &quot;Science Out Loud.&quot; Check out these other
  awesome videos, and visit our website.<br /><br />Good.<br /><br />Now wait
  for it.<br /><br />OK.<br /><br />That's it.</p>
