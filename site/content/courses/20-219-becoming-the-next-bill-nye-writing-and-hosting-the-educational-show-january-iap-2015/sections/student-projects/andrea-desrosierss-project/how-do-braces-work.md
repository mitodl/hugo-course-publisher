transcript: >-
  <p>Science Out Loud.<br /><br />Every day, we rely on a substance that's
  harder than iron or steel, our teeth.<br /><br />[MUSIC PLAYING] <br /><br
  />So if teeth are harder than steel, they must also be harder than bone.<br
  /><br />And if they're harder than bone, then why does your jaw, which is made
  of bone, not crumble under all that pressure?<br /><br />There's a bit of
  tissue called the periodontal ligament, or PDL, around your teeth under your
  gums.<br /><br />The PDL is a shock absorber, cushioning your jawbone from all
  the chewing forces.<br /><br />OK, so far, so good.<br /><br />But what if
  your teeth come in all funky?<br /><br />Sure, it looks kind of goofy.<br
  /><br />But that's not the only reason that somebody might want to fix it.<br
  /><br />Funky teeth can interfere with the way you talk and the way you
  eat.<br /><br />So how do we fix this?<br /><br />Well, we basically break our
  mouths with braces, except it's actually our bodies that do the breaking.<br
  /><br />The PDL has these cells called mechanoreceptors.<br /><br />And when
  these cells detect a force on your teeth that's too big, like if you
  accidentally bite into your fork, they signal the brain to stop biting down
  before you hurt yourself.<br /><br />Braces tether your teeth, pulling them
  together or pushing them apart.<br /><br />Either way, they're applying a
  steady force to your teeth.<br /><br />And when mechanoreceptors in the PDL
  sense this kind of smaller but sustained force, they signal cells called
  osteoclasts to the area, which spew out acid and proteins to dissolve parts of
  your jawbone.<br /><br />Then the mechanoreceptors signal osteoblasts to
  come.<br /><br />And those cells deposit minerals that make bone.<br /><br
  />Osteoblasts rebuild the jawbone in a new shape that lets the PDL hold teeth
  in the new position.<br /><br />So braces basically force your body to
  dissolve itself and then rebuild itself according to their evil whims.<br
  /><br />Sounds barbaric, right?<br /><br />But your body is actually breaking
  down and rebuilding bone using osteoclasts and osteoblasts all the time, not
  just if you have braces.<br /><br />Bone remodeling is just the way our body
  grows.<br /><br />The infant body replaces almost all of its original skeleton
  by the time it's a year old.<br /><br />And it happens throughout our entire
  life.<br /><br />10% of my bone material is technically new since last
  year.<br /><br />We can manipulate the bone remodeling process to not only get
  straighter teeth, but also to treat diseases, like osteoporosis, which make
  your bones very brittle.<br /><br />By keeping overactive osteoclasts from
  dissolving the bone so much, or by boosting osteoblasts to produce more bone,
  drugs can prevent bones in those patients from breaking so easily.<br /><br
  />People with severe bone injury have to rely on bone transplants, where they
  take bone from other parts of their body and move it to the damaged area,
  which is sometimes not even possible and is always painful.<br /><br />So
  instead, Paula Hammond's group at MIT has created a new material-- --that very
  slowly releases proteins.<br /><br />And these proteins cause osteoblasts to
  go right to the site where the injury happened and generate new bone.<br /><br
  />Now, this was a really big deal for us, because it's really hard to generate
  something that very slowly releases the protein.<br /><br />Most of the time,
  the protein comes out very rapidly and gets swept away in the body, so that it
  no longer has any effect.<br /><br />It's easy to write braces off as a form
  of medieval torture.<br /><br />But it's kind of amazing that this mouth
  torture actually works.<br /><br />And the technology that makes it possible
  is not just in your braces, it's in your bones.<br /><br />Hi, my name is
  Andrea, and thank you for watching this episode of Science Out Loud.<br /><br
  />If you liked this episode, why don't you check out some of these other
