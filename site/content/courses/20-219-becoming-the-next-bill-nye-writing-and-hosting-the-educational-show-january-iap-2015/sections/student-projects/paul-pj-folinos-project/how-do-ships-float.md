title: How Do Ships Float?
transcript: >-
  <p>Science Out Loud.<br /><br />So if I take this box and just obliterate it
  in the corner right here and then put it in the water, the weight of the water
  rushing in will cause the box to sink.<br /><br />If I take this box and do
  the same thing, it tips over a little bit, but it still floats.<br /><br
  />This box uses the same kind of design that naval architects use to prevent
  ships 1,000 times bigger from sinking.<br /><br />What's so special about this
  box that prevents it from sinking, even with the big hole in its side?<br
  /><br />Let's talk about why ships sink in the first place.<br /><br />You
  probably know that things will float in water if they're less dense than water
  and sink if they're more dense.<br /><br />The metal that this ship is made
  out of is way more dense than water, so you might think it would sink.<br
  /><br />But that metal is shaped so that it traps a lot of air, which is less
  dense than water, inside it.<br /><br />So the average density of the hull of
  the ship is actually much lower than that of water, so the ship floats.<br
  /><br />But if the hull springs a leak and fills up with water, there's no
  more air to lower the average density of the hull, so the ship sinks.<br /><br
  />The design of this box basically prevents too much water from getting into
  it.<br /><br />This box's hull was divided up into watertight compartments
  with these walls called bulkheads.<br /><br />So when I made a hole right
  here, only this compartment filled up with water.<br /><br />The rest stayed
  dry and were able to keep the box afloat.<br /><br />This box is subdivided,
  and so is this ship.<br /><br />Say this ship is divided into ten watertight
  compartments.<br /><br />If one area of this ship got damaged, only that
  compartment would flood, but not any of the others.<br /><br />The added
  weight of the water here would cause the ship to tip over a little, to be
  angled or trimmed in the water, but it wouldn't completely sink, and could
  still be taken to a port for repairs.<br /><br />So even with subdivision, why
  do ships still sink?<br /><br />Well, it's impractical and expensive to design
  an unsinkable ship, especially because most of the time, ships just don't see
  that much damage.<br /><br />What naval architects do now is try to predict
  what kind of damage is most likely to happen when designing a ship.<br /><br
  />Now, ships are more complicated than this box.<br /><br />Naval architects
  have to think about where to subdivide the ship, the shape of the hull, and
  equipment that goes into the compartments.<br /><br />We don't know when
  people first start subdividing ships, but the caps of Chinese trade ships as
  far back as the fifth century indicate that water would be able to enter the
  vessel without causing it to sink.<br /><br />It's pretty crazy that
  technology that existed so long ago is still being used today.<br /><br
  />Hello, I'm Paul.<br /><br />Thank you for watching Science Out Loud.<br
