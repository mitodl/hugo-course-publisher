Overview
--------

This session could be called: Making People Care 101. We'll cover what makes for compelling text, both in a general science communication sense and in the context of scripting and video planning. Then, we'll integrate the written word with the spoken, with a hosting workshop building on yesterday's case studies. Today's session will be a continuous workshop of writing, table reading, critiquing, and filming led by George Zaidan and Elizabeth.
