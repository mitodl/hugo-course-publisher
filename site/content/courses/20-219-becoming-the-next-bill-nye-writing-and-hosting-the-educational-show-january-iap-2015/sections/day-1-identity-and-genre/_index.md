Assignments
-----------

### Assignment

What's one aspect of science / engineering that you find fascinating? Can you tell it in a nugget that a middle schooler could remember and find fascinating / memorable, that acts like a trailer for a 5-min. episode on that topic? Post your 1-2 min. pitch to the class tumblr with the tag #day1pitch and think about how this could grow into a full-fledged episode. How would you convince someone with a middle-school background they should care? How would you engage their curiosity? Brainstorm 3 other possible pitches based on other STEM "nuggets" and bring to class tomorrow.

### Daily Blog / Vlog

Provide documentation on your process / difficulties in completing this assignment. This can take the form of a written blog post reflection, photos, another "selfie" video (<2 min.), or other creative media format of your choice. Upload the post to the class tumblr with the tag #day1**.**
