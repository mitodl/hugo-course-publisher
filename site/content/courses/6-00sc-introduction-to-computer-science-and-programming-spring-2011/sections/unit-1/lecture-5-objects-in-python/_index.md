Check Yourself
--------------

What is mutability?

› _View/hide answer_

A mutable object's values can be changed; we must be careful when working with mutable objects not to inadvertently change them.

What is the important difference between a list and a tuple?

› _View/hide answer_

Tuples are immutable (as are strings).

What is cloning?

› _View/hide answer_

Cloning creates a copy of a mutable object, so that the values can be manipulated without mutating the original object.

What are the important aspects of a dictionary?

› _View/hide answer_

A dictionary is mutable, with immutable keys, and unordered.
