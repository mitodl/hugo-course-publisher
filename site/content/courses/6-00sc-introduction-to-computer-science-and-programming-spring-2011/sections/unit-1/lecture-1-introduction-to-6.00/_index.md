Check Yourself
--------------

What is the difference between declarative and imperative knowledge?

› _View/hide answer_

Declarative knowledge is statements of fact; imperative knowledge is "how to" knowledge.

What is the advantage of a stored-program computer?

› _View/hide answer_

It's far more versatile than a fixed-program computer, since it interprets a program given to it and carries out those instructions, as opposed to being built to do one thing.

What are the syntax, static semantics, and semantics of a language?

› _View/hide answer_

Syntax determines whether a string is legal, static semantics determine whether the string has meaning, and semantics assigns a meaning to a legal sentence (assuming no static semantic errors).

What sorts of errors can occur in a program?

› _View/hide answer_

It can crash, run forever, or give a wrong answer.

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 0 (Assigned)

Problem set 0 is assigned in this session. This is an ungraded problem set. The instructions can be found on the session page where it is due, Lecture 2 [Core Elements of a Program]({{% getpage "courses/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/sections/unit-1/lecture-2-core-elements-of-a-program/_index.md" %}}).
