Session Overview

It then discusses simulation models, and illustrates some of the ideas underlying simulations modeling by simulating a random walk.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_Image courtesy of [donovanbeeson](http://www.flickr.com/photos/donovan_beeson/5792363110/) on Flickr._{{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Check Yourself
--------------

What is a generator?

› _View/hide answer_

A function that remembers the point in the function body where it last returned a value and the values of all local variables.

What is the difference between yield and return?

› _View/hide answer_

When yield is used, the state of the function is not lost.

What is a model?

› _View/hide answer_

A model is a theoretical construct that will provide useful information about the possible behaviors of the system being modeled.

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 5: RSS Feed Filter (Due)

In problem set 5, you will build a program to monitor news feeds over the Internet. Your program will filter the news, alerting the user when it notices a news story that matches that user's interests (for example, the user may be interested in a notification whenever a story related to the Red Sox is posted).
