It then returns to the topic of using probability and statistics to derive information from samples.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Check Yourself
--------------

Can probabilities be added?

› _View/hide answer_

In general, one cannot add probabilities.

What is a Monte Carlo simulation?

› _View/hide answer_

A simulation which arrives at an approximation of a probability by running many, many trials.

What is the guiding principle of inferential statistics?

› _View/hide answer_

A random sample tends to exhibit the same properties as the population from which it is drawn.

What is the law of large numbers (a.k.a. Bernoulli's Law)?

› _View/hide answer_

The law of large numbers basically says that using more test cases in a simulation involving randomness will increase our confidence in its results.

What is the gambler's fallacy?

› _View/hide answer_

The belief that random numbers will even out constantly (e.g. that after a string of heads, it's “time for” the coin to come up tails.)

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 6: Simulating Robots (Due)

In this problem set you will practice designing a simulation and implementing a program that uses classes.
