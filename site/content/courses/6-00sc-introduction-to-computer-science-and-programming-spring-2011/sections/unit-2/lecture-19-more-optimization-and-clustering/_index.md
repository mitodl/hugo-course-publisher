It then moves on to discuss supervised and unsupervised machine learning optimization problems. Most of the time is spent on clustering.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_Image courtesy of [Squiggle](http://www.flickr.com/photos/stephenr/4151278461/) on Flickr._{{< br >}}{{< br >}}

What is machine learning?

› _View/hide answer_

"A scientific discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data." From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

What is inductive inference?

› _View/hide answer_

The observation of examples that represent incomplete information about some statistical phenomenon in order to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions.

What is supervised learning?

› _View/hide answer_

Learning in which a label is associated with each example in a training set.

What is unsupervised learning used for?

› _View/hide answer_

Uncovering hidden regularities or detecting anomalies in data.

What is clustering?

› _View/hide answer_

The process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way.

What is agglomerative clustering?

› _View/hide answer_

Clustering that merges clusters iteratively.
