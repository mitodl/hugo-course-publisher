As part of that discussion we introduce inheritance.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_Image courtesy of [The Ridg](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ridg/4289125796/) on Flickr._{{< br >}}{{< br >}}

What is an instance?

› _View/hide answer_

Instances are the actual objects built in accordance with the qualities of the class.

What is an abstract data type?

› _View/hide answer_

A set of objects and the operations on those objects.

What is encapsulation?

› _View/hide answer_

Encapsulation means that names (of variables and methods) are stored in locations that then have to be accessed, called namespaces.

What is data hiding?

› _View/hide answer_

Data hiding makes data invisible to users of the object, requiring it to be accessed only via the object's methods.

What functions can subclasses use?

› _View/hide answer_

Subclasses can use all the functions of their superclass. They can also use any functions that are defined within the subclass; however, if the subclass uses the same name for a function which has also been used in the superclass, it will only use the subclass definition of that function.
