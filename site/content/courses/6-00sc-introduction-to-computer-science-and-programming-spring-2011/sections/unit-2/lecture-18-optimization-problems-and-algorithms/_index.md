It then moves on to introduce the notion of an optimization problem, and illustrates it using the 0/1 knapsack problem.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_Image courtesy of [kob42kob](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kob42kob/52185287/) on Flickr._{{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Check Yourself
--------------

What does an optimization problem consist of?

› _View/hide answer_

An optimization problem requires that an objective function be optimized, either by maximizing or minimizing the function. There may also be a set of constraints that must be accounted for.

What is problem reduction?

› _View/hide answer_

Taking a problem with an unknown solution and reducing it to a problem or problems with known solutions.

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 8: Simulating The Spread of Disease and Virus Population (Due)

In this problem set, using Python and pylab you will design and implement a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics, and reach conclusions about treatment regimens based on the simulation results.
