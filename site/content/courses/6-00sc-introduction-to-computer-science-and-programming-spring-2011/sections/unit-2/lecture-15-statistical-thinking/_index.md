It covers standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and standard error. It also shows how to use pylab to produce histograms.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_Image courtesy of [Kevin Dooley](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/866975841/) on Flickr._{{< br >}}{{< br >}}

What does the standard deviation tell us?

› _View/hide answer_

It is a distance which describes the range +/- from the mean containing a particular fraction of the values; it describes the shape of the bell curve.

What is variance?

› _View/hide answer_

A measure of how much spread there is in the possible different outcomes.

What is the coefficient of variation?

› _View/hide answer_

The standard deviation divided by the mean. If it's less than 1, the distribution is considered low-variance.
