It then shows how Monte Carlo simulations can be used to analyze the classic Monty Hall problem and to find an approximate value of pi.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_Image courtesy of [Xiaozhuli](http://www.flickr.com/photos/xiaozhuli/3530033168/) on Flickr._{{< br >}}{{< br >}}

Check Yourself
--------------

What is a Gaussian distribution?

› _View/hide answer_

Also known as a normal distribution, a Gaussian distribution is symmetric and can be fully characterized by its mean and standard deviation.

What is a uniform distribution?

› _View/hide answer_

One where each outcome has the same probability. The distribution can be fully characterized with a single parameter, the range.

What is important about an exponential distribution?

› _View/hide answer_

This is the only continuous memory-less distribution, meaning that the probability of any outcome at a point in time is independent of the outcome at any previous time.

Problem Sets
------------

### Problem Set 7: Simulating The Spread of Disease and Virus Population (Due)

In this problem set, using Python and pylab you will design and implement a stochastic simulation of patient and virus population dynamics, and reach conclusions about treatment regimens based on the simulation results.
