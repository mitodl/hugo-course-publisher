Textbooks
---------

The original textbook for 6.00 and the course lectures parallel each other, though there is more detail in the book about some topics. The book is NOT required. We will not be referring to it in assignments or depending upon it to cover holes in the lectures.

Spring 2013 edition. MIT Press, 2013. ISBN: 9780262519632.

A second edition of the textbook is now available. However, there may be some discrepancies between the original course lectures included on this course site and the sections in this second edition of the textbook.

If you choose not to purchase this book, you will probably find it useful to buy or borrow another book that covers Python. You might check your local public library's resources, or search online for a free Python text, such as [_How to Think Like a Computer Scientist_](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html) or ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[_An Introduction to Python (PDF)_](http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/Python.pdf).

Breadth-First and Depth-First Searches

Although two of these are Wikipedia articles, these pages have a lot of information, including animated images showing you what nodes are chosen. Once you understand how both algorithms work, try writing out the order nodes are visited in another graph using both BFS and DFS.
