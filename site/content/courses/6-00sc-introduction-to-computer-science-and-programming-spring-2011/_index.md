course_description: >-
  <p>This subject is aimed at students with <strong>little or no programming
  experience</strong>. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the
  role computation can play in solving problems. It also aims to help students,
  regardless of their major, to feel justifiably confident of their ability to
  write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class
  will use the Python programming language.</p>
