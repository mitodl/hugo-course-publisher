  This first course in the physics curriculum introduces classical mechanics.
  Historically, a set of core concepts—space, time, mass, force, momentum,
  torque, and angular momentum—were introduced in classical mechanics in order
  to solve the most famous physics problem, the motion of the planets.


  The principles of mechanics successfully described many other phenomena
  encountered in the world. Conservation laws involving energy, momentum and
  angular momentum provided a second parallel approach to solving many of the
  same problems. In this course, we will investigate both approaches: Force and
  conservation laws.

  Our goal is to develop a conceptual understanding of the core concepts, a
  familiarity with the experimental verification of our theoretical laws, and an
  ability to apply the theoretical framework to describe and predict the motions
  of bodies.
