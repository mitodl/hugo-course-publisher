A particle is moving in a circle of radius \\(\\displaystyle r\\) with an angular acceleration given by \\(\\displaystyle \\vec{\\alpha }(t)=\\dfrac {1}{r}(A-Bt)\\hat{k}\\), or \\(\\displaystyle a\_{\\theta }=(A-Bt)\\hat{\\theta }\\) where \\(\\displaystyle A\\) and \\(\\displaystyle B\\) are positive constants. At time \\(\\displaystyle t\_0=0\\), the particle is at an angle \\(\\displaystyle \\theta (0)\\) measured with respect to the \\(\\displaystyle +x\\)-axis, and the tangential component of its velocity is \\(\\displaystyle v\_{\\theta }(0)=v\_0\\).

Find the particle's angular position \\(\\displaystyle \\theta (t)\\) as a function of time to obtain the arc length travelled by the particle during the time \\(\\displaystyle t\\) and defined as \\(\\displaystyle s(t)=r(\\theta (t)-\\theta (0))\\). Express your answer in terms of \\(\\displaystyle r\\), \\(\\displaystyle A\\), \\(\\displaystyle B\\), \\(\\displaystyle t\\), and \\(\\displaystyle v\_0\\)
