  <p><span m='4280'>Now we'd like to analyze in more depth</span> <span
  m='6950'>our result that for a system of particles--</span> <span m='9900'>so
  let's indicate our system.</span> </p><p><span m='11780'>We had particle
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='13730'>We have our jth particle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='15650'>And we have a particle N. So here's</span> <span m='18500'>our
  system of particles where the total force caused</span> <span m='23780'>the
  momentum of the system of particles to change.</span> </p><p><span
  m='28010'>Now, I'd like to examine that concept of the total force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='32000'>Before we said that our total force on the jth
  particle--</span> <span m='36620'>we just wrote it like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='38870'>And I'm going to put a little t up here for the
  moment.</span> </p><p><span m='42630'>Because when we examine what force we
  mean here--</span> <span m='47070'>and I also want to put a little boundary
  around our system.</span> </p><p><span m='52580'>And let's now consider
  another particle</span> <span m='55460'>internal to the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='57910'>And let's try to identify the types</span> <span
  m='60230'>of forces on the jth particle.</span> </p><p><span m='62390'>We can
  really have two types of forces here.</span> </p><p><span m='66200'>Our first
  force can be an interaction between these two</span> <span
  m='71270'>particles.</span> </p><p><span m='72450'>So what I'll write is the
  force on the jth particle</span> <span m='78110'>due to the interaction
  between the k and the jth particle.</span> </p><p><span m='82079'>And I'm
  going to put a little sign up here.</span> </p><p><span m='83870'>I'm going to
  write this internal.</span> </p><p><span m='86660'>What do I mean by
  internal?</span> </p><p><span m='88490'>This is a force strictly between the
  internal particles</span> <span m='92479'>in the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='93600'>Now, of course, we know that there</span> <span m='95870'>must be a
  force on the kth particle</span> <span m='100460'>due to the interaction
  between the jth and the kth particle.</span> </p><p><span m='104390'>And we
  can call that internal.</span> </p><p><span m='107810'>So what we have here is
  that we can</span> <span m='112220'>divide-- there can still be other forces
  acting on the jth</span> <span m='116420'>particle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='117350'>And we'll do a decomposition like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='120060'>We'll say that the total force on the jth particle</span> <span
  m='125030'>can come from some external forces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='128990'>There could be an object outside our system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='132800'>If these were interacting gravitationally,</span> <span
  m='135050'>there could be a planet outside here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='137150'>And this could be a moon.</span> </p><p><span m='138590'>And our
  system is just the moons.</span> </p><p><span m='140630'>That would be an
  external gravitational force,</span> <span m='143360'>plus the total internal
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='147960'>So I'm going to keep this same
  color.</span> </p><p><span m='150170'>Internal on the jth particle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='153079'>Now how do we write this total internal force?</span>
  </p><p><span m='157140'>Well, we're interested in the force on the jth
  particle.</span> </p><p><span m='162260'>But the internal forces can come from
  all of the other particles</span> <span m='166400'>in the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='167820'>So what we're looking at here is for a sum over
  all</span> <span m='174140'>of the possible interactions where the other
  particles, k,</span> <span m='180110'>go from 1 to N. And we have to be very
  careful here that</span> <span m='183800'>in this sum k cannot be equal to
  j.</span> </p><p><span m='188780'>Now this sum-- again, because it's a little
  bit tricky</span> <span m='193910'>to understand-- is the internal force on
  the jth particle.</span> </p><p><span m='199800'>Here's the kth one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='201110'>But this could be a sum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='203329'>I'll just draw one here.</span> </p><p><span m='205340'>This is the
  internal force on the jth particle</span> <span m='208220'>due to particle
  number 1.</span> </p><p><span m='210400'>And so we're adding as k goes from 1
  to N</span> <span m='213740'>all of these internal forces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='215660'>But we're excluding the case when</span> <span m='217190'>k equals
  j, because that would be</span> <span m='219560'>a force of an object on
  itself.</span> </p><p><span m='221840'>And this quantity here, we can
  write</span> <span m='224120'>as the total internal force on the jth
  particle.</span> </p><p><span m='230180'>So in summary, we see that the total
  force on the jth particle</span> <span m='237800'>is equal to the total
  external forces.</span> </p><p><span m='241640'>I didn't say total
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='244140'>I'm assuming there could be many
  different types</span> <span m='246800'>of internal forces plus the total
  internal force.</span> </p><p><span m='251930'>A little bit later on, we can
  drop the T's</span> <span m='254900'>for simplicity of notation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='257990'>But this is our big idea, that a force on the jth
  particle,</span> <span m='262100'>external plus internal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='264530'>And now when we look at this sum,</span> <span m='268490'>and we
  want to now apply our main idea,</span> <span m='272720'>we have that the
  force, which we're writing as-- let's</span> <span m='281360'>explore
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='282120'>Our total force is the sum of the forces
  on the jth particle.</span> </p><p><span m='290210'>And we've now done this
  decomposition.</span> </p><p><span m='293120'>I'm going to drop total.</span>
  </p><p><span m='295040'>So it's the sum of the external forces on the jth
  particle.</span> </p><p><span m='304550'>j goes from 1 to N.</span>
  </p><p><span m='307310'>And here, we have a sum of the internal forces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='315930'>So we have our sum j.</span> </p><p><span
  m='318230'>It goes from 1 to N of the internal forces on the jth</span> <span
  m='325149'>particle.</span> </p><p><span m='328790'>Now we want to apply
  Newton's second law.</span> </p><p><span m='331940'>And the concept is very
  straightforward.</span> </p><p><span m='334760'>But the mathematical
  expression can be a little bit messy.</span> </p><p><span m='339720'>We know
  by Newton's second law that the sum</span> <span m='343880'>of a pair of
  internal forces is zero-- third law,</span> <span m='347690'>by Newton's third
  law.</span> </p><p><span m='349320'>So what we're saying here is, as an
  example,</span> <span m='353840'>for Newton's third law-- let's just
  focus</span> <span m='359120'>on this particular pair-- that F internal kj
  plus F internal jk</span> <span m='372230'>is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='374750'>So this is the statement that internal forces</span> <span
  m='380880'>cancel in pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='385950'>And so when I look
  at this total internal force, which</span> <span m='393390'>is the sum of all
  of these pairs of internal forces,</span> <span m='397950'>I can see that the
  total internal force has to be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='405240'>So
  internal force cancel in pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='408830'>Now here, we
  can see it another way if we</span> <span m='413400'>want to look at this
  notation.</span> </p><p><span m='415080'>We took the sum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='416960'>j goes from 1 to N of F internal j.</span> </p><p><span
  m='421710'>Now we use our definition for F internal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='424770'>This where things get a little bit messy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='428160'>k goes from 1 to N. k not equal to j.</span> </p><p><span
  m='433140'>j goes from 1 to N. F internal kj.</span> </p><p><span
  m='440220'>This looks terribly messy.</span> </p><p><span m='442290'>But what
  we're saying is this sum is just a sum of pairs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='449820'>And every single pair in this adds to 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='453850'>So what we have for our statement now</span> <span m='458520'>is
  that the total force is the sum of the external forces,</span> <span
  m='463710'>plus the sum of the internal forces</span> <span m='466080'>which
  we've now said that cancels in pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='469480'>So let's
  rewrite that as the total force-- now instead</span> <span m='475110'>of
  writing this sum, let's write it</span> <span m='477390'>as the sum of the
  external forces.</span> </p><p><span m='482340'>And the internal forces cancel
  in pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='486790'>And so this is now our force on our
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='491610'>It's only the external force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='494270'>And now we can recast our Newton's second law</span>
  <span m='498540'>for a system of particles with the following statement</span>
  <span m='502050'>that the external force causes the momentum of the
  system</span> <span m='508740'>to change.</span> </p><p><span m='510270'>And
  this becomes our expression for Newton's second law</span> <span
  m='516840'>when we apply it to a system of particles</span> <span
  m='519690'>where the beauty of this idea is that no matter how
  complicated</span> <span m='525000'>the interaction is inside the
  system,</span> <span m='527850'>all of those interactive pairs sum to
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='531870'>And so only thing that matters is the
  external force</span> <span m='536310'>in terms of changing the momentum of
  the system.</span> </p><p><span m='540060'>And now we'll look at some
  applications of that.</span> </p>
