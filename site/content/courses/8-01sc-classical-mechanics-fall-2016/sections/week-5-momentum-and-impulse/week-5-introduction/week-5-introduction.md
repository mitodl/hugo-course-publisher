  <p><span m='1220'>Up until now, we have analyzed the motion of objects</span>
  <span m='4340'>that we treated as so-called point masses, where
  literally</span> <span m='7790'>all of the mass of the object was
  treated</span> <span m='9800'>as lying at a single point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12350'>This is obviously an unrealistic idealization.</span> </p><p><span
  m='15620'>Real objects have spatial extent and come</span> <span m='17990'>in
  various sizes and shapes, some regular</span> <span m='20390'>and some highly
  irregular.</span> </p><p><span m='22580'>The mass distribution within these
  extended objects</span> <span m='25370'>might be smooth and uniform or highly
  non-uniform and lumpy.</span> </p><p><span m='29660'>Moreover, sometimes, we
  will be interested in simultaneously</span> <span m='32810'>analyzing a large
  system of particles or objects.</span> </p><p><span m='36650'>To deal properly
  with such situations,</span> <span m='39470'>it is necessary to introduce a
  new physical quantity called</span> <span m='42590'>the momentum, which is a
  vector that we traditionally denote</span> <span m='45950'>with the symbol P.
  For a single point mass,</span> <span m='49550'>the momentum is the product of
  the mass and the velocity</span> <span m='51980'>vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='53460'>The form of Newton's second law that we have used so far,</span>
  <span m='56580'>F equals ma, is actually only true for the special case</span>
  <span m='59900'>of a point mass.</span> </p><p><span m='61280'>The more
  general form of the Newton's Second Law</span> <span m='63440'>is that F
  equals dp/dt, that is that the force is</span> <span m='67430'>equal to the
  time derivative of the momentum vector.</span> </p><p><span m='70880'>This is
  applicable to either a single particle</span> <span m='73550'>or to a system
  of particles.</span> </p><p><span m='75800'>This more general form provides
  us</span> <span m='77930'>the way to address extended objects</span> <span
  m='79700'>or multi-particle systems.</span> </p><p><span m='81620'>We will
  once again appeal to a calculus-like argument,</span> <span m='84680'>breaking
  down an extended distribution</span> <span m='86690'>into a large number of
  small elements,</span> <span m='89450'>treating each element separately, and
  then summing</span> <span m='91820'>the results.</span> </p><p><span
  m='92960'>As part of this process, we will introduce the concept</span> <span
  m='95750'>of the center of mass, a sort of mass weighted average
  position</span> <span m='100250'>for an extended object or system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='102950'>Momentum is also the first of several special
  measurable</span> <span m='106220'>quantities that we will discuss that obey
  special powerful</span> <span m='110120'>rules called conservation
  laws.</span> </p><p><span m='112370'>The other two quantities are energy and
  angular momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='115789'>Conservation laws are
  principles to provide that the given</span> <span m='118550'>measurable
  quantity remains unchanged during the evolution</span> <span m='121730'>of a
  system with time as long as certain requirements are</span> <span
  m='124910'>met, essentially the requirement that a system remains
  isolated.</span> </p><p><span m='129800'>With this restriction in place, the
  possible evolution</span> <span m='132710'>of motion of a particle or system
  of particles</span> <span m='135320'>is greatly restricted, simplifying its
  calculation.</span> </p><p><span m='138620'>We will see how this can be used
  to our advantage</span> <span m='140720'>in understanding what will
  happen.</span> </p><p></p>
