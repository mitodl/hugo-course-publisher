transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4010'>Let's consider a ball that is dropped</span> <span
  m='7220'>from a certain height, h i, above the ground and this ball</span>
  <span m='13160'>is falling.</span> </p><p><span m='14500'>It hits the ground
  and it bounces up</span> <span m='18250'>until it reaches some final height, h
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='24310'>Now when the ball is colliding with the
  ground,</span> <span m='26390'>there are collision forces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='27820'>And in this problem what we like to do</span> <span m='29660'>is
  figure out what the average force of the ground</span> <span m='31840'>is on
  the ball.</span> </p><p><span m='36310'>And that will be the normal
  force,</span> <span m='37790'>the average normal force, on the ball during the
  collision.</span> </p><p><span m='43120'>Now if we look at this ball
  dropping,</span> <span m='46450'>it's going to lose a little bit of
  energy,</span> <span m='50020'>because it's getting compressed at the
  collision.</span> </p><p><span m='52460'>Let's look at an example of the
  actual ball dropping.</span> </p><p><span m='56180'>As you can see in this
  high speed video,</span> <span m='58390'>as the ball falls down, it collides
  with the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='61830'>When it collides with the
  ground, it's compressed.</span> </p><p><span m='65860'>And then as it rebounds
  upwards, the ball</span> <span m='69230'>expands back to its original
  shape,</span> <span m='71490'>but it doesn't quite get to the same height--
  that's</span> <span m='74450'>because when the ball is compressed,</span>
  <span m='76010'>there's some deformation in the rubber structure of the
  ball,</span> <span m='79380'>and it's not a completely elastic
  deformation.</span> </p><p><span m='82670'>And so some of the energy is
  transformed into, first,</span> <span m='86610'>molecular motions, which turn
  into thermal energy that's</span> <span m='90420'>radiative into the
  environment.</span> </p><p><span m='92740'>Let's look in particular at the
  details of the collision.</span> </p><p><span m='95960'>If we look at it in
  slow motion what we have here--</span> <span m='99750'>and I'll draw a
  picture-- as the ball is colliding</span> <span m='103350'>with the ground,
  ball compresses,</span> <span m='106070'>expands as it goes upwards.</span>
  </p><p><span m='108100'>And so we can draw a free body diagram of the
  ball</span> <span m='111000'>with a normal force and a gravitational
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='115070'>Now let's choose our positive direction
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='119430'>So now what we'd like to do is apply the
  momentum principle</span> <span m='122900'>to analyze the average normal
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='126540'>And our momentum principle, remember is
  impulse.</span> </p><p><span m='130889'>The force integrated over some time
  during the collision</span> <span m='134760'>is equal to the change in
  momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='137620'>So what we'd like to do is
  identify</span> <span m='140110'>the states that are relevant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='142120'>So it will have a state before, so what we'll
  do</span> <span m='145250'>is we'll call this the before state,</span> <span
  m='148370'>and that's right before the ball is hitting the ground.</span>
  </p><p><span m='154240'>And we have an after state, and in the after
  state,</span> <span m='162160'>the ball has now finished colliding with the
  ground,</span> <span m='166040'>and it's now moving up with speed up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='168480'>Now again, we're going to choose a positive up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='172490'>Here on representing things as it speeds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='178100'>One of the things, we need some times here,</span>
  <span m='180950'>so let's say that t initial is zero, this is our final
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='187050'>We'll call this time the before
  time,</span> <span m='189550'>we'll just call this t before, and this is t
  after.</span> </p><p><span m='195050'>And then our integral is going from
  before to</span> <span m='198690'>after the momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='200950'>And we can now apply the momentum principle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='205370'>Well, this is a vector equation and we've chosen unit
  vectors</span> <span m='208930'>up, so what we have here is the
  integral</span> <span m='212300'>of from t before to t after of N minus mg,
  integrated over dt,</span> <span m='220250'>and that's equal to the momentum
  at the y</span> <span m='223220'>component of the momentum at t after,</span>
  <span m='226040'>minus the y component of the momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='229061'>We don't have a vector here anymore.</span> </p><p><span
  m='230560'>The y component of the vector, t before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='234329'>And so this is our expression of the momentum principle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='237130'>Impulse causes momentum to change.</span> </p><p><span
  m='239570'>Now we're assuming that the normal force just averaging it</span>
  <span m='246380'>and so this intregral simply becomes N average minus</span>
  <span m='253460'>ng, times the time of collision, is equal to-- now in
  here</span> <span m='259320'>we can put the mass of the ball, we have the
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='262820'>Now here's where we have to be a
  little bit</span> <span m='264650'>careful, because we're looking at the y
  component.</span> </p><p><span m='268160'>We chose speed downwards, that's in
  the negative y direction,</span> <span m='271660'>so we have minus-- sorry,
  we're looking at after.</span> </p><p><span m='276270'>We have plus V after,
  because this is going in the positive j</span> <span
  m='280680'>direction.</span> </p><p><span m='282500'>And over here we have a
  negative mass,</span> <span m='287920'>but it's going in the minus
  direction,</span> <span m='291140'>so we have a minus mV before, and so
  we</span> <span m='295540'>get mass times V after plus V before.</span>
  </p><p><span m='300170'>So our first result is that the normal force
  average.</span> </p><p><span m='306610'>Let's bring the divide through by
  delta t,</span> <span m='309720'>and bring the Ng term over, so we have m Va
  plus Vb,</span> <span m='315600'>divided by delta t, plus mg.</span>
  </p><p><span m='322230'>So we see that if the collision time is very
  short,</span> <span m='326130'>then this average force is a little bit
  bigger.</span> </p><p><span m='329220'>A long collision time, the average
  force</span> <span m='331910'>a little bit smaller.</span> </p><p><span
  m='333940'>Now from kinematics, we already have worked out the problem</span>
  <span m='337530'>that the speed for an object that</span> <span
  m='339960'>rises to a height, h final, this is the velocity afterwards,</span>
  <span m='344220'>is just square root of 2g h final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='347790'>And in a similar way, if an object is falling height h i,</span>
  <span m='352500'>the speed when it gets to the bottom is 2ghi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='357140'>And so now we can conclude with these
  substitutions</span> <span m='360640'>that the average force equals m times
  square root of 2g h</span> <span m='368780'>final, plus the square root of 2g
  h initial,</span> <span m='373460'>over the collision time, plus and
  mg.</span> </p><p><span m='378970'>And of course the collision time,</span>
  <span m='381580'>we're saying is t after minus t before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='385750'>And so that's how we can use the momentum principle</span> <span
  m='388580'>to get an average expression for the normal force.</span>
