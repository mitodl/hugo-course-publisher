title: 15.1 Momentum and Impulse
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4080'>So suppose we have a point mass particle</span> <span
  m='7460'>of mass m moving with a velocity vector,</span> <span m='12560'>v. We
  can introduce a quantity we call</span> <span m='15540'>the momentum of that
  particle.</span> </p><p><span m='21690'>I'll label it with the symbol
  p.</span> </p><p><span m='24400'>And it's equal to the product of the mass
  times the velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='28810'>This is something you've
  undoubtedly seen before.</span> </p><p><span m='30960'>Now, let's think about
  the dimensions</span> <span m='32558'>of momentum for a moment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='33600'>So dimensionally, momentum has units</span> <span
  m='37010'>of mass times the velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='38980'>And so
  that's in SI units, the units of mass are kilograms</span> <span m='45130'>and
  then the units of velocity are meters per second.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52490'>You can also express momentum dimensionally</span> <span
  m='54800'>as a product of a force times time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='58920'>And so, again in SI units, units force are the Newton</span> <span
  m='62060'>and the units of time is the second.</span> </p><p><span
  m='64670'>So these are the SI units for momentum, two different ways</span>
  <span m='67210'>of writing the same dimensions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='70970'>Now, we've seen that for a single particle,</span> <span
  m='80330'>we can write Newton's second law as the force is</span> <span
  m='84750'>equal to the mass times the acceleration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='89550'>Or equivalently, we can write that</span> <span m='91190'>as the
  mass times the time derivative</span> <span m='94630'>of the acceleration,
  dv/dt.</span> </p><p><span m='97970'>Now, if m is a constant, then I can
  rewrite this as F</span> <span m='111350'>is equal to the time derivative of
  the mass times the velocity,</span> <span m='120960'>or equivalently as the
  time derivative of the momentum,</span> <span m='125750'>since mv is just
  equal to p.</span> </p><p><span m='128759'>So I actually want to stress this
  much--</span> <span m='130600'>I'm going to put it in a box because
  it's</span> <span m='132308'>very important that I can write Newton's second
  law,</span> <span m='135010'>instead of F equals ma, as F equals the
  time</span> <span m='137520'>derivative of the momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='140084'>And this is absolutely where we'll</span> <span m='141500'>see the
  momentum becomes very useful.</span> </p><p><span m='149400'>Because it turns
  out that this form of Newton's second law</span> <span m='152760'>is actually
  the most general form of the equation</span> <span m='157230'>because it's
  applicable not just to a single point mass,</span> <span m='160340'>but also
  to a more complicated system.</span> </p><p><span m='162410'>A system
  consisting of many masses</span> <span m='164540'>or a system where the masses
  changing</span> <span m='166430'>or the masses flowing, as in a fluid.</span>
  </p><p><span m='168550'>In all of those cases, this form of Newton's second
  law</span> <span m='172079'>is correct.</span> </p><p><span m='172940'>F
  equals ma, which is probably more familiar to you,</span> <span m='175710'>is
  actually a special case of this law for the case</span> <span m='178030'>of a
  single point mass.</span> </p><p><span m='179780'>So this is where we'll see
  that momentum is quite</span> <span m='182230'>a useful concept, especially as
  we start considering</span> <span m='184650'>more complicated systems, as
  we'll get to a little later</span> <span m='188840'>in the course.</span>
  </p><p><span m='190490'>What I want to do now though, is to take a closer
  look</span> <span m='192950'>at this equation, force is equal to the time
  derivative</span> <span m='197100'>of the momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='197950'>Whenever we have a relation involving</span> <span m='200480'>a
  derivative like this, we can always also</span> <span m='203990'>rewrite it in
  an equivalent integral form, which</span> <span m='207156'>can be very useful
  and give us a different way of looking</span> <span m='209530'>at the same
  information.</span> </p><p><span m='210570'>So let's take a look at
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='213550'>So if I take this equation and integrate
  both sides</span> <span m='216940'>with respect to time, then I can
  write</span> <span m='220230'>that as the integral of F with respect to
  time</span> <span m='228070'>is equal to the integral of the right-hand
  side,</span> <span m='232210'>dp/dt with respect to time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='236542'>Now, let's make this a definite integral.</span> </p><p><span
  m='238250'>I'll go from time t1 to time t2 on both sides here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='248420'>Now, this right-hand side is just--</span> <span
  m='252530'>so the integral of dp/dt with respect to time</span> <span
  m='255360'>is just p at time2 minus p at time1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='264280'>And that is just the change in the momentum vector</span> <span
  m='269860'>going from time1 to time2.</span> </p><p><span m='274220'>Now, this
  integral on the left-hand side,</span> <span m='276830'>we give a special
  name.</span> </p><p><span m='278170'>We call this the impulse.</span>
  </p><p><span m='282870'>This name, impulse, calls to mind a short, sharp,
  shock</span> <span m='287280'>of some sort.</span> </p><p><span m='288050'>But
  it can also refer to a weak force</span> <span m='290810'>acting over a long
  interval.</span> </p><p><span m='292590'>And notice here the function F, the
  force F,</span> <span m='295750'>is in general a function of time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='298014'>So this doesn't necessarily mean a constant f.</span>
  </p><p><span m='299930'>This could mean a force that's varying in time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='303160'>And what this equation tells us is</span> <span
  m='305450'>that the change in the momentum of the system</span> <span
  m='308170'>doesn't depend on the detailed time dependence of F,</span> <span
  m='311440'>but rather just on the integral of F.</span> </p><p><span
  m='314890'>And so suppose I were to graph the force as a function of
  time</span> <span m='323970'>going from time0 to a time delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='328590'>And suppose I had some complicated function
  that</span> <span m='333200'>looked like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='336610'>The impulse is just the area under this curve.</span> </p><p><span
  m='339970'>It's the integral of this function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='345720'>That's the impulse.</span> </p><p><span m='346590'>And the change
  in the momentum depends</span> <span m='349080'>only on the area under this
  curve</span> <span m='351350'>and not on the detailed shape of the
  curve.</span> </p><p><span m='356440'>So what that means is that I can define
  an average force</span> <span m='362570'>by choosing a constant force
  that</span> <span m='369300'>has the same area as this example on the
  left.</span> </p><p><span m='372600'>So suppose I calculated that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='374750'>And there is some constant force here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='378290'>I'll call this F average.</span> </p><p><span
  m='382660'>Going over the same time interval.</span> </p><p><span
  m='388910'>The average force is that constant force</span> <span
  m='391730'>which has the same area as the area under my F of t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='397380'>So in other words, F average times delta t,</span>
  <span m='402440'>which is the area on the right-hand side here,</span> <span
  m='404690'>is equal to the integral of F of t dt integrated</span> <span
  m='412690'>from 0 to delta t, which is the area</span> <span m='417370'>under
  this right-hand curve.</span> </p><p><span m='418700'>And so my average force
  is just that integral, F of t dt,</span> <span m='428080'>divided by delta
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='430000'>And this is integrated from 0 to delta
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='432830'>So that's my average force.</span>
