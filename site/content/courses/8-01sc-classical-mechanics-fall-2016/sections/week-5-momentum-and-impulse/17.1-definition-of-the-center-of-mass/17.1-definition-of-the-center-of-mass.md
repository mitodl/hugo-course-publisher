title: 17.1 Definition of the Center of Mass
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3830'>Today we'd like to explore the idea</span> <span m='5990'>of
  the center of mass, or the center of gravity,</span> <span m='8360'>of a rigid
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='9530'>For instance, take this rod.</span>
  </p><p><span m='11330'>And if I try to balance it on my finger</span> <span
  m='13460'>at a certain point in that rod, I'm</span> <span m='15410'>balancing
  it via the gravitational force.</span> </p><p><span m='18620'>And this point
  is often referred to as the center</span> <span m='20690'>of gravity of the
  rod.</span> </p><p><span m='22550'>Now, if we were in empty space with no
  gravitational field,</span> <span m='26270'>then center of gravity doesn't
  make any sense.</span> </p><p><span m='29300'>But this point still coincides
  with what</span> <span m='31070'>we call the center of mass of the
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='34020'>And now I'd like to define center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='37070'>So let's consider our rigid body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='40100'>And we'll just describe it as some object--</span>
  <span m='43740'>we'll make it idealized-- and that there's</span> <span
  m='47510'>going to be trying to find some point in this object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='51470'>And we'll identify that point as the center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='55070'>Now, let's imagine that this rigid body is
  made up</span> <span m='58040'>of a bunch of little pieces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='60240'>So we have m, j.</span> </p><p><span m='62060'>And this
  j piece is located from the center</span> <span m='65450'>of mass, a vector
  rcm.</span> </p><p><span m='68960'>Now how we want to define this particular
  point</span> <span m='73730'>is that when we make the sum from j</span> <span
  m='76490'>equals 1 to n over every single point in this body,</span> <span
  m='81500'>then that will be 0.</span> </p><p><span m='85250'>And this will be
  the definition of the center of mass,</span> <span m='91510'>that when you add
  up the position vector with respect</span> <span m='96920'>to this point
  weighted by the mass,</span> <span m='100130'>and you add up all of those
  vectors, you'll get 0.</span> </p><p><span m='103460'>Now, if you don't know
  where the center of mass is then</span> <span m='107210'>this is difficult to
  calculate.</span> </p><p><span m='109039'>So let's find a way where you choose
  an arbitrary point,</span> <span m='112140'>and that's write that arbitrary
  point, say, over here.</span> </p><p><span m='116890'>We'll write it like
  this-- s.</span> </p><p><span m='119300'>And we'll treat that as our
  origin.</span> </p><p><span m='121340'>And I'll draw a vector, rsj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='125750'>And here, I'll draw the vector Rcm.</span>
  </p><p><span m='130639'>And now what we have from our vector
  relationship</span> <span m='135140'>is that the vector rsj equals the vector
  Rcm--</span> <span m='140390'>and that's what I want to find-- plus the vector
  rcmj.</span> </p><p><span m='147890'>And now let's add up-- multiply each of
  these by the mass</span> <span m='152870'>and make a sum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='154370'>So we have mj rsj equals the sum of mj.</span> </p><p><span
  m='163310'>Now, the vector Rcm, this vector,</span> <span m='166790'>no matter
  where we picked a point in this object,</span> <span m='169710'>the vector's
  always the same.</span> </p><p><span m='171620'>And that's why I pulled it out
  of the sum.</span> </p><p><span m='173480'>And over here, I have the sum from
  j</span> <span m='175550'>goes from 1 to n, j 1 to n, of mj rcmj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='183140'>Now, recall, this is precisely how</span> <span
  m='185780'>we define the center of mass point, that this is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='190240'>And so we can now conclude that the center of
  mass--</span> <span m='195620'>so you pick an arbitrary point, and if you
  want</span> <span m='198079'>to find that vector to the center of mass, what
  you do</span> <span m='201110'>is you make the sum from j goes from 1 to n of
  mj rsj,</span> <span m='207579'>and you divide that by j goes from 1 to n,
  mj.</span> </p><p><span m='213290'>And this is what we call the center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='217070'>So conceptually, the center of
  mass</span> <span m='219680'>is the point in the object where,</span> <span
  m='221630'>if you take a vector to any of the little mass elements,</span>
  <span m='224810'>and you weight it by the mass element, and you add them
  up,</span> <span m='227400'>you get 0.</span> </p><p><span m='228890'>If you
  wanted to calculate the center of mass about any point,</span> <span
  m='232400'>you choose a point, s, you draw the vector from s</span> <span
  m='235520'>to the object.</span> </p><p><span m='236870'>You sum up those
  vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='238130'>We see by our vector triangle
  rule</span> <span m='241010'>that we can now calculate that center of mass
  vector</span> <span m='243710'>by this equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='246630'>And now let's just rewrite this because this is the total
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='253100'>And what we see is that the Rcm equals j
  goes from 1 to n,</span> <span m='260640'>mj rsj divided by the total
  mass.</span> </p><p></p>
