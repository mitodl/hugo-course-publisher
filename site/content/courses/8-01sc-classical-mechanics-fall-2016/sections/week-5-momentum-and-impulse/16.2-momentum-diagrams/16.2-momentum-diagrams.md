title: 16.2 Momentum Diagrams
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3290'>We would like to now introduce a new methodological
  tool</span> <span m='6310'>for analyzing problems that involve momentum
  transfers.</span> </p><p><span m='9840'>And we call that tool momentum
  diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='13800'>Now, what we'd like to do is
  look</span> <span m='17310'>at our fundamental idea, which was, for discrete
  objects,</span> <span m='22620'>we have that-- involved in a collision-- we
  have</span> <span m='26420'>that the external force integrated with
  respect</span> <span m='30010'>to time-- in poles-- is equal to the change in
  momentum</span> <span m='34890'>between two different states.</span>
  </p><p><span m='37440'>So this is the momentum of the final state,</span>
  <span m='41570'>and this is the momentum of the initial state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='46560'>So when we want to analyze problems,</span> <span
  m='49400'>how can we methodologically introduce a picture</span> <span
  m='52780'>representation of our problems?</span> </p><p><span m='55060'>So
  let's look at what we need to do first.</span> </p><p><span m='58800'>We
  always need to choose a system that we're referring to.</span> </p><p><span
  m='63650'>And with respect to the choice of that system,</span> <span
  m='66320'>we need to also choose a reference frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='71700'>Now, once we've done that, we can now</span> <span
  m='73530'>represent a collision with respect to this system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='77430'>For instance, let's consider two objects-- as our
  system</span> <span m='80960'>Object 1 and Object 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='83180'>They're moving on a frictionless, horizontal</span> <span
  m='86000'>surface.</span> </p><p><span m='87320'>And we're choosing as a
  reference frame, the ground</span> <span m='90330'>frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='92600'>Now, what we'd like to do is identify two states.</span>
  </p><p><span m='96050'>So for our initial state, we'll have--</span> <span
  m='101479'>if we're given some initial conditions-- what</span> <span
  m='103670'>we'd like to do is represent each object with a velocity</span>
  <span m='107310'>vector.</span> </p><p><span m='108330'>So here, we'll write
  the 1 initial,</span> <span m='111070'>and let's suppose this object is coming
  at it with the 2</span> <span m='114800'>initial as an example.</span>
  </p><p><span m='117030'>And once we've represented the velocities of the
  objects,</span> <span m='119780'>we can write down their momentum in the
  initial state.</span> </p><p><span m='122980'>Similarly, if these two objects
  collide and they're moving,</span> <span m='128220'>we actually don't know
  which way those objects will end up</span> <span m='131920'>moving.</span>
  </p><p><span m='133110'>And so what we'd again like to do in our final
  state,</span> <span m='136020'>after this collision, is to represent the
  velocities by,</span> <span m='140600'>again, vectors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='141770'>So this is V1 final and this is V2 final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='147740'>And then, we can represent the change in momentum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='151220'>So our momentum principle now becomes-- in this
  case,</span> <span m='155400'>let's just assume that the external force
  here</span> <span m='160480'>sums to zero-- we're assuming no friction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='163870'>And then our momentum principle says that 0</span>
  <span m='167944'>equals P final minus P initial.</span> </p><p><span
  m='171770'>And now, we can read off those momentums</span> <span m='173670'>as
  vectors on the diagram, and so what we have</span> <span m='177350'>is that
  the final momentum will be</span> <span m='179120'>equal to the initial
  momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='180870'>So we can write down M1 final plus
  M2</span> <span m='185330'>V2 final is equal to M1 V1 initial plus M2 V2
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='195380'>And that's how we can represent a
  collision where there</span> <span m='199910'>is no external forces and use
  our momentum principle</span> <span m='203410'>to get an vector
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m='206710'>Now, in many problems, you're given
  information.</span> </p><p><span m='208940'>You might be given information
  about the speeds and magnitudes</span> <span m='212700'>of the objects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='214230'>And in order to then take this equation</span> <span
  m='216740'>and represent it in speeds and directions or even
  components,</span> <span m='222430'>we need to choose some coordinate
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='226230'>So if we choose a coordinate system--
  and that's</span> <span m='230220'>the third step-- so suppose we choose a
  coordinate system,</span> <span m='236290'>then we can start to look at two
  different representations</span> <span m='240120'>for our problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='241890'>For instance, let's just choose this to be the i hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='247320'>Now, given that choice, we could
  describe the velocities</span> <span m='253680'>in terms of components.</span>
  </p><p><span m='255570'>Now this gets awkward-- V1i x component i hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='262210'>And similarly, we can write down all the velocities--
  V2i--</span> <span m='268020'>as V2ix i hat, et cetera, for all the
  velocities.</span> </p><p><span m='275680'>And our momentum equation in
  components</span> <span m='278330'>then becomes, in the i hat direction, M1
  V1ix</span> <span m='284000'>plus-- well, here we have the final state,</span>
  <span m='286310'>so let's make this consistent-- the final plus M2 V2 final
  x</span> <span m='295659'>equals M1 V1 initial x plus M2 V2 initial x.</span>
  </p><p><span m='305060'>And that's the same equation that we have as vectors,
  now</span> <span m='308290'>expressed in terms of components.</span>
  </p><p><span m='310370'>And recall that components can be positive or
  negative.</span> </p>
