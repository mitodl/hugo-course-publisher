  <p><span m='3470'>We'd like to consider a system of particles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5960'>Let's say we have object one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8200'>We'll call this the j-th object, object n.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12440'>And somewhere in this system of particles is a center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='15460'>Now, we know that the external
  force</span> <span m='20240'>is causing the momentum of the system to
  change,</span> <span m='24680'>and what we'd now like to show is</span> <span
  m='26510'>that we can reduce this system to</span> <span m='28520'>an
  effective single particle.</span> </p><p><span m='32630'>The way we'll do that
  is recall that the momentum of the system</span> <span m='37220'>is given by
  the sum of the individual momentums.</span> </p><p><span m='40670'>We'll call
  that the j-th particle where</span> <span m='42950'>we're summing j from 1 to
  n.</span> </p><p><span m='45370'>And that's the sum of the momentums</span>
  <span m='47330'>of the various particles.</span> </p><p><span m='49040'>Now
  when you differentiate the momentum</span> <span m='52220'>of the system with
  respect to time,</span> <span m='54830'>we're just differentiating the
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='59490'>And so that becomes the
  acceleration</span> <span m='61670'>of the j-th particle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='63230'>Now we saw when we define the center of mass</span> <span
  m='67130'>that the acceleration of the center</span> <span m='68660'>of mass
  times the total mass of the system</span> <span m='71960'>was equal to the sum
  of mj aj.</span> </p><p><span m='76530'>j goes from 1 to n.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78890'>So we see that another way to think</span> <span
  m='82460'>about how the momentum of the system of particles is changing</span>
  <span m='86480'>is simply the total mass times the acceleration</span> <span
  m='92750'>of the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='94820'>And our
  combination of Newton's second and third law</span> <span m='99770'>now
  becomes that only the external forces</span> <span m='102920'>cause the
  momentum of the system to change so that's</span> <span m='105590'>equal to
  the total mass times the acceleration of the center</span> <span m='110960'>of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='112039'>Now what does this equation really
  mean?</span> </p><p><span m='115340'>So let's draw our pictures again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='118140'>Here's our system.</span> </p><p><span m='120140'>We
  have particles 1, et cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='122810'>That's the j-th
  particle, n particles.</span> </p><p><span m='126110'>And in here is the
  center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='129259'>Now I'm going to outline my
  system like this</span> <span m='132680'>and what this equation is
  telling</span> <span m='134240'>us is that we can just focus by putting all of
  the mass</span> <span m='140220'>and total at the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='143750'>And that center of mass is going to move</span> <span
  m='147770'>according to some trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m='152180'>And
  all we have to think about is</span> <span m='155780'>this is a point particle
  of total mass m, m total.</span> </p><p><span m='167850'>So what we've done is
  we've done a very important reduction.</span> </p><p><span m='172350'>We've
  taken a complicated system of particles</span> <span m='175050'>and reduced it
  to a single point particle</span> <span m='178230'>of total mass m located at
  cm.</span> </p><p><span m='183780'>And the dynamics of that total
  particle</span> <span m='186390'>is if there is external force acting on this
  system,</span> <span m='191010'>we place this external force at the center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='194520'>And now we can calculate the
  acceleration</span> <span m='198030'>of the center of mass is just that
  external force divided</span> <span m='203760'>by the total mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='205650'>And that's how we can reduce this complicated
  system</span> <span m='209520'>of particles to a translational motion of the
  center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='216360'>Now we still cannot describe
  the individual interactions</span> <span m='221489'>in the system, but we're
  not trying to do that anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='223780'>We're not trying
  to trace how each particle moves.</span> </p><p><span m='226500'>We're just
  looking at as our system is a point particle</span> <span m='229170'>and
  talking about how that point-like object is</span> <span
  m='232110'>translating the space.</span> </p><p><span m='234300'>And this is a
  powerful tool that we use again</span> <span m='236880'>and again and
  again.</span> </p><p></p>
