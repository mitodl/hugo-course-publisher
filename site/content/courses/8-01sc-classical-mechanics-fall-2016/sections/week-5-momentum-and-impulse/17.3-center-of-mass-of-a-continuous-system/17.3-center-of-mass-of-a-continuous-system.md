title: 17.3 Center of Mass of a Continuous System
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3760'>Let's try to find the center of mass of a uniform
  object</span> <span m='8400'>like a uniform rod.</span> </p><p><span
  m='10790'>And let's assume this rod is length L,</span> <span m='13560'>and we
  want to find the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='17730'>Now, before I
  begin this calculation,</span> <span m='21130'>you can probably already guess
  that it's</span> <span m='23020'>going to be exactly in the middle, and we'll
  verify that,</span> <span m='25990'>but let's first define what we mean by our
  center of mass</span> <span m='30390'>for discrete particles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='34140'>Recall that this was a sum over all</span> <span
  m='37190'>the particles in the system.</span> </p><p><span m='38930'>So we'll
  take a label J goes from 1 to N,</span> <span m='41560'>and it was the mass of
  that jth particle times the position</span> <span m='45980'>vector that jth
  particle with respect to some origin,</span> <span m='49660'>and we're
  dividing that by j equals</span> <span m='51680'>from 1 to N of the total mass
  in the system.</span> </p><p><span m='58050'>Now, how do we translate this
  equation</span> <span m='59920'>for a continuous system?</span> </p><p><span
  m='61400'>And let me just again show that we had chosen an origin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='64870'>Here was our jth particle of mass mj and rj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='71860'>So what we want to do is draw the analogy,</span> <span
  m='73610'>and here's how it works-- that for each discrete particle,</span>
  <span m='78600'>we're going to look at that as some mass element delta
  mj.</span> </p><p><span m='83910'>Our vector rj will go to a vector for this
  mass element.</span> </p><p><span m='89100'>I'll just write it delta m.</span>
  </p><p><span m='91580'>And our sum from j goes from 1 to N</span> <span
  m='95979'>is actually going to go to an integral over the body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='101120'>So let's see how that looks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='103670'>So first, we'll do it with the total mass,</span> <span
  m='107530'>m-- here we're summing over j-- from 1 to N of mj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='118660'>That goes to the integral over the body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='122330'>Now, the delta m, when we take limits,</span> <span
  m='126570'>because that's when an integral goes, we'll write that as
  dm.</span> </p><p><span m='130805'>So that becomes a limit over the
  body.</span> </p><p><span m='133930'>And likewise, our sum j goes from
  1</span> <span m='136960'>to N of mj rj goes to an integral over the body of
  dm</span> <span m='145765'>vector r going to that element.</span> </p><p><span
  m='148360'>So we can say in the limit that this becomes</span> <span
  m='151110'>r going to that element.</span> </p><p><span m='154770'>Now, that
  means that our continuous expression</span> <span m='158820'>for the
  continuous object is an integral</span> <span m='160880'>over the body of dm r
  to that element dm divided</span> <span m='166460'>by an integral over the
  body of dm.</span> </p><p></p>
