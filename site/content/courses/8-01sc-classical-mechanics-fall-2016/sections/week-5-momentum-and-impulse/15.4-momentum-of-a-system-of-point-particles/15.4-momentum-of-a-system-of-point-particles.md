title: 15.4 Momentum of a System of Point Particles
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3920'>Let's now extend our concept of momentum</span> <span
  m='6320'>to a system of particles.</span> </p><p><span m='8240'>Again, we need
  to choose a reference frame.</span> </p><p><span m='10430'>So we'll have a
  ground frame.</span> </p><p><span m='12170'>And let's consider N
  particles.</span> </p><p><span m='16730'>Now when we have a lot of
  particles,</span> <span m='18290'>we need some type of notation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20540'>So let's use the symbol j.</span> </p><p><span
  m='22820'>And it will goes from 1 to N. And then</span> <span m='26210'>our
  arbitrary j particle will be moving.</span> </p><p><span m='30770'>This
  particle will have mass mj.</span> </p><p><span m='33260'>And it will be
  moving with a velocity vj.</span> </p><p><span m='36770'>Now recall in our
  system, we have many other particles.</span> </p><p><span m='40190'>We can
  call that one 1.</span> </p><p><span m='41550'>This is one n.</span>
  </p><p><span m='43760'>We have lots of different particles in the
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='47040'>And this just represents an arbitrary
  particle</span> <span m='49940'>in that system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='51500'>And the momentum of the jth particle</span> <span m='54950'>is just
  the mass, mj, times the velocity, vj.</span> </p><p><span m='59810'>And again,
  we're assuming some fixed reference frame.</span> </p><p><span m='63890'>So
  the total momentum of this system,</span> <span m='67430'>we now have to add
  up the momentum</span> <span m='70400'>of all the particles, all the way up to
  the nth particle.</span> </p><p><span m='76340'>Now, when we make a sum like
  this,</span> <span m='78710'>there is a standard mathematical summation
  notation,</span> <span m='82020'>which we'll write like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='83450'>We'll do the sum, this capital sigma sin of j goes from
  1 to j</span> <span m='90920'>goes to N of the momentum of the jth
  particle.</span> </p><p><span m='98720'>And that represents the sum j goes
  from 1 to n of mj vj.</span> </p><p><span m='108430'>And this is what we call
  the momentum of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='112070'>This is a vector
  sum.</span> </p><p><span m='116720'>And now let's see how Newton's second law
  applies</span> <span m='121550'>to the momentum of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='123830'>Suppose that acting on our particles--</span> <span
  m='126950'>for instance, here's our jth particle-- we have a force</span>
  <span m='132340'>Fj acting on the jth particle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='136370'>Then we know that from Newton's law</span> <span m='141320'>that
  the force will be also the sum of the forces on all</span> <span m='148329'>of
  the particles, F1, F2, plus dot, dot, dot, plus FN.</span> </p><p><span
  m='156020'>So once again, we can write this as a sum</span> <span m='160170'>j
  goes from 1 to N of the force on the jth particle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='165140'>And that's the force on the summing</span> <span m='168170'>over
  all the forces on all the particles in the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='172200'>But now, we can apply Newton's second law.</span> </p><p><span
  m='176490'>So Newton's second law is the statement</span> <span
  m='181610'>that the force on the jth particle</span> <span m='184760'>causes
  the momentum of the jth particle to change.</span> </p><p><span m='191810'>And
  when we write that now, the total force on the system,</span> <span
  m='196235'>j goes from 1 to N, is just the sum of the change in
  momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='204470'>Because every single term-- let's
  just look at that.</span> </p><p><span m='208360'>T1 plus dP2/dt plus dot,
  dot, dot, plus dPN/dt,</span> <span m='217730'>that's what we mean by the
  sum.</span> </p><p><span m='219440'>We can rewrite this as d/dt of P1 plus P2
  plus P3</span> <span m='229010'>plus dot, dot, dot, plus PN.</span>
  </p><p><span m='233410'>And what we see is that the total force is</span>
  <span m='240190'>the derivative of the sum j goes from 1 to N of the
  momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='249740'>But recall, this sum we've
  defined</span> <span m='254030'>as the momentum of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='256200'>So our conclusion is the total force</span> <span
  m='259399'>causes the momentum of the system to change.</span> </p><p><span
  m='265570'>Now so far, all we've done is we've</span> <span m='268070'>recast
  Newton's second law in this form.</span> </p><p><span m='271550'>Our next step
  is to analyze the forces</span> <span m='274550'>on the individual particles
  we have</span> <span m='277010'>and apply Newton's third law.</span>
  </p><p><span m='279480'>So we'll do that next.</span> </p>
