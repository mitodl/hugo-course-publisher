title: 17.6 Velocity and Acceleration of the Center of Mass
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3330'>I'd now like to talk about the velocity of the center of
  mass</span> <span m='6500'>for a system of particles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8290'>So let's take a system, which I'll just outline by this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='11590'>And in that system, we have a bunch of particles,
  particle 1,</span> <span m='14840'>particle 2-- let's refer to this as the
  j-th particle</span> <span m='18530'>and some point xcm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='22130'>And if I want to talk about the position of the center of
  mass,</span> <span m='26550'>I can choose a point s.</span> </p><p><span
  m='29960'>And if I want to define that vector Rcm,</span> <span m='33360'>then
  what I have to do is draw a vector to each object Rsj.</span> </p><p><span
  m='40050'>And we saw that this velocity, the position</span> <span
  m='43200'>of the center of mass with respect to this origin</span> <span
  m='45800'>s is the sum and mjrsj.</span> </p><p><span m='51520'>And that's
  divided by the total mass and m total.</span> </p><p><span m='57780'>And j
  goes from 1 to n, where n is the number</span> <span m='60310'>of particles in
  the system.</span> </p><p><span m='62830'>Now if I want to find the velocity
  of the center of mass,</span> <span m='66770'>then I can just differentiate
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='70870'>And I'm dropping the point s for the
  moment,</span> <span m='74420'>but let's just differentiate 1 to n.</span>
  </p><p><span m='77100'>And you'll see why.</span> </p><p><span m='78900'>And
  when I differentiate the position vector</span> <span m='81850'>of the object,
  that's the velocity of the object divided</span> <span m='85900'>by j goes
  from 1 to n, the total mass.</span> </p><p><span m='90130'>Now why did I drop
  the position?</span> </p><p><span m='93140'>Because if you have any two
  fixed</span> <span m='95470'>points-- so if I chose another fixed point, say,
  over here p,</span> <span m='103400'>then this distance R-- we'll call it
  vector from s</span> <span m='109140'>to t Rsp-- this is a constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='113759'>And if I draw position vector with respect to p--
  now</span> <span m='117810'>the point here is that this is a constant
  distance,</span> <span m='121800'>because this is a fixed-- these are fixed
  points.</span> </p><p><span m='127030'>Then if you were to draw your vector
  triangle, which</span> <span m='129860'>is the position of the object with
  respect to s--</span> <span m='133680'>that's this vector-- is equal to that
  fixed position</span> <span m='137890'>vector from s to p, plus the vector
  from p to j,</span> <span m='143510'>and I differentiate this, drs jdt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='149490'>Well, this derivative of a constant vector,
  this</span> <span m='154190'>is 0 plus drp jdt.</span> </p><p><span
  m='160340'>And so we see that the velocity j</span> <span m='163750'>is
  independent of the choice of point s.</span> </p><p><span m='175120'>You
  choose any other fixed point and you</span> <span m='177430'>get that
  velocities drs jdt equals</span> <span m='184920'>drp jpt for all fixed points
  p.</span> </p><p><span m='193670'>And that's why in this expression,
  when</span> <span m='195560'>we differentiate the velocity, even though we had
  an index s,</span> <span m='198470'>we dropped that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='199770'>And so our conclusion is that we can</span> <span m='202390'>treat
  that we have the velocity of the center of mass</span> <span m='207030'>of
  this system is equal to the sum mj vj.</span> </p><p><span m='212410'>j from 1
  to n divided by the total mass.</span> </p><p><span m='218760'>Now what's
  interesting here is, why</span> <span m='220890'>is this an important
  quantity?</span> </p><p><span m='223270'>Let's just add that if we want to
  talk</span> <span m='225380'>about the acceleration of the center of
  mass,</span> <span m='228790'>I do exactly the same type of
  calculation.</span> </p><p><span m='231540'>I just differentiate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='233000'>And I get the mass of the j-th particle</span> <span
  m='235550'>times the acceleration of the j-th particle divided</span> <span
  m='238630'>by the total mass.</span> </p><p><span m='242830'>And our next step
  is to understand</span> <span m='245060'>why this is an important
  quantity</span> <span m='248360'>for a system of particles.</span> </p><p></p>
