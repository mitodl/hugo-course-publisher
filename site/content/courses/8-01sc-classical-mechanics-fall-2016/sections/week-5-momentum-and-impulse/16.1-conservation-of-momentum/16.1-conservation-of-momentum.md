  <p><span m='1980'>Let's examine when the momentum of a system is
  constant,</span> <span m='4820'>and apply that to solving problems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='7330'>First, we'll revisit the impulse equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='10520'>On the left, we have the impulse,</span> <span
  m='12460'>the integral of the total external force acting</span> <span
  m='14950'>on a system between some initial and final times.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18590'>And on the right, we have the change</span> <span
  m='20680'>in the total momentum of the system,</span> <span m='22620'>between
  those initial and final times.</span> </p><p><span m='26740'>In a situation
  where the impulse is 0,</span> <span m='30110'>we have that the change in the
  momentum is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='32880'>P initial is equal to p
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='35940'>In other words, the momentum of the
  system</span> <span m='38100'>is constant between some initial and final
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='42530'>This is a vector equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='44320'>But in many problems, we can set up our coordinate
  system</span> <span m='47420'>so we only have to consider one
  dimension.</span> </p><p><span m='51820'>Here's a simple example of one block
  moving along</span> <span m='54370'>a horizontal surface with some initial
  velocity,</span> <span m='57510'>colliding with a block at rest.</span>
  </p><p><span m='59470'>And then the two blocks stick together and move.</span>
  </p><p><span m='63100'>Is momentum constant during this collision?</span>
  </p><p><span m='66580'>To answer that question, we need to think</span> <span
  m='68430'>about what our system is.</span> </p><p><span m='71789'>Let's look
  at the system of both blocks together.</span> </p><p><span m='75220'>We can
  see the external forces, gravity and the normal force,</span> <span
  m='78770'>add up to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='80560'>So our total external
  force is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='83970'>During the collision, each block
  exerts a force on the other.</span> </p><p><span m='89310'>But that is an
  internal force if both blocks</span> <span m='92120'>are included in our
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='94810'>You can see that if our system was just
  one of the two blocks,</span> <span m='97930'>we would need to know the
  collision force in order</span> <span m='100350'>to solve for the final
  speed.</span> </p><p><span m='102400'>Therefore, we will choose our
  system</span> <span m='104039'>to be the two blocks together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='106900'>We then need to set up a coordinate system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='110140'>We'll pick the origin here, and this direction to be
  positive</span> <span m='113860'>x.</span> </p><p><span m='115440'>Now we need
  to identify the initial and final states.</span> </p><p><span m='118750'>Our
  initial state will be just before the blocks collide.</span> </p><p><span
  m='121920'>The momentum of the system is the sum</span> <span m='125280'>of
  the momentum of each block individually.</span> </p><p><span m='129320'>We
  have m1 times v1 initial x times i-hat plus m2 times</span> <span
  m='137800'>v2 initial x times i-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='141390'>This
  second term is 0, since block 2 starts at rest.</span> </p><p><span
  m='146590'>The final state is right after the collision</span> <span
  m='148470'>when the two blocks are moving together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150620'>They have the same velocity, so the final momentum</span> <span
  m='154079'>is m1 plus m2 times v final x times i-hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='163710'>This gives us an equation that will</span> <span m='165640'>allow
  us to solve for whatever quantity we are not given.</span> </p><p><span
  m='171510'>Now let's look at a similar collision, one that's</span> <span
  m='173650'>happening in two dimensions.</span> </p><p><span m='175120'>If we
  have one block coming up from the bottom,</span> <span m='177360'>hitting one
  that's coming in from the side,</span> <span m='179790'>I'll choose my unit
  vectors to be like this, my origin here.</span> </p><p><span m='184850'>The
  momentum equation gives us two equations,</span> <span m='188150'>one along
  the x direction and the other</span> <span m='190180'>along the y
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='192560'>Once again I'll choose the initial
  state</span> <span m='194240'>to be just before the collision and the final
  state</span> <span m='197260'>to be just after the collision.</span>
  </p><p><span m='200110'>The momentum in the initial state</span> <span
  m='202030'>is again the sum of the momentum of each block individually.</span>
  </p><p><span m='208780'>And the momentum in the final state</span> <span
  m='210560'>is the mass of the two blocks added together</span> <span
  m='213020'>times the velocity of the two blocks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='216900'>Notice that this velocity has a component in both</span> <span
  m='220100'>the x and the y directions.</span> </p><p><span m='223710'>Again
  the total external force on the system is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='227920'>So
  the impulse is 0 in both the x and y directions,</span> <span m='230360'>and
  therefore, momentum is conserved for both the x and y</span> <span
  m='233860'>components.</span> </p><p><span m='235070'>So I can write my two
  momentum equations like this.</span> </p><p><span m='245020'>The impulse
  equation is a vector equation.</span> </p><p><span m='248050'>So generically,
  in two dimensions,</span> <span m='250270'>we will have two equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='253521'>We always need to check that the momentum is
  conserved</span> <span m='255770'>in each direction separately.</span>
  </p><p><span m='257459'>And it is possible to have a case where
  momentum</span> <span m='259870'>is conserved in one direction but not the
  other,</span> <span m='262860'>if we have some net external force in one
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='270640'>What would happen if, in our 1d
  collision example,</span> <span m='274510'>the blocks now experienced friction
  along the surface?</span> </p><p><span m='278730'>Can we still assume that the
  momentum is conserved?</span> </p><p><span m='281997'>In fact, if we pick a
  point in time right before the collision</span> <span m='284580'>and compare
  that to a point in time right after the collision,</span> <span m='287640'>we
  can see that the impulse from friction</span> <span m='290700'>is over such a
  short period of time,</span> <span m='293800'>that the impulse is really
  small.</span> </p><p><span m='296290'>And we can say that the momentum is
  approximately constant.</span> </p><p><span m='299990'>If we consider times
  later, after the collision is over,</span> <span m='303900'>then momentum is
  certainly not conserved,</span> <span m='306360'>which is what you would
  expect.</span> </p><p><span m='307830'>You'll see the two blocks slow down due
  to friction.</span> </p><p><span m='312390'>So even if there are other forces
  acting on the system,</span> <span m='315860'>like friction or gravity, we can
  still</span> <span m='318460'>calculate the result of a collision</span> <span
  m='320550'>as if the momentum is constant during the collision</span> <span
  m='323260'>by picking times only a very small delta t apart.</span>
