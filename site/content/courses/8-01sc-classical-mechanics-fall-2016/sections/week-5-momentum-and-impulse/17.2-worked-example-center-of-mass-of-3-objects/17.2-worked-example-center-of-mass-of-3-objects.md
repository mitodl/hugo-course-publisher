title: 17.2 Worked Example - Center of Mass of 3 Objects
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='5420'>The little prince is sitting on his little planet,</span>
  <span m='8960'>and he's watching the planets go by.</span> </p><p><span
  m='11840'>And so suddenly, he's seeing three of them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='14690'>One, two, three.</span> </p><p><span m='17160'>And he wonders, hmm,
  what would the center of mass</span> <span m='20330'>of these three planets
  be?</span> </p><p><span m='23180'>So let's calculate it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='26060'>We have one planet here that's three times</span> <span
  m='28890'>the mass of this guy.</span> </p><p><span m='31030'>And then this
  one has half of m1.</span> </p><p><span m='35390'>And I've written this up
  there already.</span> </p><p><span m='38030'>And the center of mass, when we
  want</span> <span m='40070'>to determine its coordinate-- it is a
  coordinate</span> <span m='43900'>that depends on this coordinate
  system,</span> <span m='46610'>and this origin here-- then we need</span>
  <span m='51430'>to have the total mass of the system,</span> <span
  m='53430'>because it's a mass-weighted coordinate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='57160'>And so the total mass is going to be 4.5 m1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='60680'>And if we want to calculate this position</span> <span
  m='66860'>function of the center of mass, Rcm,</span> <span m='70150'>that is
  the mass weight here.</span> </p><p><span m='73720'>And then we need the sum
  of all of our masses</span> <span m='79810'>times our distances.</span>
  </p><p><span m='83470'>We're going to sum here over j from 1 to n.</span>
  </p><p><span m='88390'>And what that means is we need to now write out</span>
  <span m='90520'>the sum for our three planets.</span> </p><p><span
  m='93690'>And we need to give this a radius here,</span> <span m='95800'>so
  the r1 would be going from here to here.</span> </p><p><span m='100020'>r2
  goes from here to there.</span> </p><p><span m='102020'>And r3 from here to
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='104270'>You need to write them out in the i hat
  direction</span> <span m='108150'>and in the j hat direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='112810'>Let's add that here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='115160'>And then sum it all up and calculate our r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='119620'>So let's write this out.</span> </p><p><span m='122040'>We have m1,
  and we're going to have 35 and 10.</span> </p><p><span m='128139'>35 i hat
  plus 10 j hat plus m2.</span> </p><p><span m='135870'>It's going to be 5 and
  20.</span> </p><p><span m='140525'>5 and 20.</span> </p><p><span
  m='144390'>And then m3, we have 40 and 30.</span> </p><p><span m='155670'>And
  what we can do-- oh, and of course that</span> <span m='157780'>has to be
  divided by my system mass.</span> </p><p><span m='164190'>And what we can do
  is we can concentrate first</span> <span m='166579'>on the x component, and
  then on the y component.</span> </p><p><span m='172910'>Maybe we'll just
  continue here.</span> </p><p><span m='176510'>So we're going to have-- and we
  can plug it in all the m's.</span> </p><p><span m='181760'>We'll do it for the
  x component first.</span> </p><p><span m='184720'>We're going to have m1, and
  then we have 35 i hat plus here</span> <span m='196290'>we're going to have
  1/2 m2.</span> </p><p><span m='199720'>That is 3m1 5 plus-- and for m3, we
  have 0.5 m1 40.</span> </p><p><span m='215440'>that's in the i hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='218829'>And we'll have to divide that over
  our system mass.</span> </p><p><span m='224510'>And then we do the same for
  the y component.</span> </p><p><span m='231100'>So m1, 10 plus 3. m1, 20 plus
  0.5 m1 30 j hat.</span> </p><p><span m='250600'>And again, we have to divide
  this over our system mass.</span> </p><p><span m='256839'>So this boils down
  to-- hang on.</span> </p><p><span m='263030'>Let me redo this again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='264100'>Let me actually look at the answer first.</span>
  </p><p><span m='268807'>What do I have here?</span> </p><p><span m='270270'>70
  and 85, OK.</span> </p><p><span m='274310'>So this boils to m1 over the system
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='282150'>And we have 70 in the i hat plus 85 in
  the j hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='290120'>So the 70 comes from this
  term, the 80 comes from this.</span> </p><p><span m='293320'>And I put it back
  together, and now we need to plug in this one</span> <span
  m='296050'>here.</span> </p><p><span m='297500'>And so we will get in the end
  of that Rcm equals m over 4.5 m.</span> </p><p><span m='306220'>So the m goes
  away, and we have a factor of 1/4.5 here.</span> </p><p><span m='310970'>We'll
  divide this through, and we're</span> <span m='313160'>going to have 15.5 in
  the i hat direction, and 18.9</span> <span m='330580'>in the j hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='334960'>All right, so let's see where this
  fits on our graph here.</span> </p><p><span m='339930'>So 15 in the i hat is
  somewhere here.</span> </p><p><span m='343740'>And 19 is almost 20, so it's
  going</span> <span m='347380'>to be here, so about there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='354060'>So this is my Rcm, and this here is</span> <span m='357830'>my
  center of mass of the system of these three little planets.</span>
  </p><p><span m='366090'>Of course, we used approximate math here for all the
  planets.</span> </p><p><span m='369750'>But if we look at the real
  numbers,</span> <span m='371770'>imagine that this would be Earth,</span>
  <span m='373740'>and it has one Earth mass.</span> </p><p><span m='378110'>And
  if this were Saturn, it would have something</span> <span m='381350'>like 318
  Earth masses.</span> </p><p><span m='385180'>And if this is Pluto, it would
  have 0.0025 Earth masses.</span> </p><p><span m='394600'>You will see that
  Saturn really holds all the weight.</span> </p><p><span m='400220'>And if we
  were to do this calculation with these numbers</span> <span m='402880'>here,
  then our Rcm would-- and keeping this coordinate system</span> <span
  m='410100'>in the arrangement of the planets,</span> <span m='412350'>then it
  would go right into-- if here's the center,</span> <span m='415810'>it would
  go right next to the center right over here,</span> <span m='422920'>because
  Saturn just weighs so, so, so much more than Pluto</span> <span m='426720'>and
  Earth together.</span> </p>
