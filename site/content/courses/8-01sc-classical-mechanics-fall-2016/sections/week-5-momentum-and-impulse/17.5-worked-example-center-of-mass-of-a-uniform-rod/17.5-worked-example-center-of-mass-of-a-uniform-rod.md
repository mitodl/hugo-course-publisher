  <p><span m='3640'>So now we want to find the center</span> <span m='5170'>of
  mass of a uniform rod.</span> </p><p><span m='6820'>And we have the result for
  a continuous body, which</span> <span m='9930'>is that integral over the body
  of dmr to that mass element dm</span> <span m='15730'>divided by an
  interval.</span> </p><p><span m='19250'>Now our goal is to figure out
  how</span> <span m='21170'>to apply this result, specifically,</span> <span
  m='24210'>to real physical objects.</span> </p><p><span m='26140'>And the key,
  as always, is choosing a coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='29060'>So
  now I'll draw the object, again.</span> </p><p><span m='31250'>And the first
  thing I'll do is choose an origin.</span> </p><p><span m='34230'>I can pick my
  origin anywhere I want.</span> </p><p><span m='36534'>I can pick it in the
  middle.</span> </p><p><span m='37700'>I can put it in the middle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='38825'>I could put it at this end.</span> </p><p><span
  m='39950'>I could put it that end.</span> </p><p><span m='41050'>I could put
  it down here, but I'll choose it over here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='44990'>Because the object is linear, this</span> <span m='46890'>is a very
  Cartesian system.</span> </p><p><span m='49450'>I'm only doing a one
  dimensional object.</span> </p><p><span m='51580'>So I choose my coordinate
  system plus x.</span> </p><p><span m='54890'>That's step one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='57380'>Now my origin-- now here comes the crucial
  thing.</span> </p><p><span m='61150'>In this argument, dm is the infinitesimal
  mass element.</span> </p><p><span m='66150'>And I want to pick that at an
  arbitrary place in the object.</span> </p><p><span m='69970'>I don't want to
  pick it at the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='71760'>I don't want to pick it
  at the end.</span> </p><p><span m='73800'>Note down here this is x equals
  L.</span> </p><p><span m='76660'>So I'll arbitrarily pick an infinitesimal
  element.</span> </p><p><span m='80660'>I'll shade it in dm.</span>
  </p><p><span m='84289'>That represents-- this is what I'm</span> <span
  m='86640'>going to make my summation over when I do my integral.</span>
  </p><p><span m='90050'>I'm going to add up all these dm's.</span> </p><p><span
  m='93440'>And the point is that the dm's are different distances</span> <span
  m='96300'>from the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='97630'>So the vector-- and
  here's the next step--</span> <span m='100120'>is I draw a picture of my
  vector rdm.</span> </p><p><span m='104200'>So now I have these terms, at
  least, explained in my diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='108630'>The next step
  is to turn-- is to introduce an integration</span> <span m='112250'>variable
  for both of these quantities.</span> </p><p><span m='115060'>So step one was
  the coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='124270'>Step two, was the
  identification of dm.</span> </p><p><span m='133381'>And step three and I
  think this is</span> <span m='135500'>absolutely the crucial one is to
  introduce the integration</span> <span m='139610'>variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='141420'>Now you'll see that will come in two different
  cases.</span> </p><p><span m='145370'>So this is the quantity, the distance
  from dm</span> <span m='148445'>to the origin that's changing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='150000'>You can see for each of these little elements, that
  changes.</span> </p><p><span m='153740'>So what I'll write [INAUDIBLE] as a
  vector is x prime,</span> <span m='158260'>which will be my integration
  variable in the i hat</span> <span m='160690'>direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='161900'>So the integration variables x prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m='164250'>That's the first place that I introduced the integration</span>
  <span m='167410'>variable.</span> </p><p><span m='168150'>And x prime, you can
  see, will vary.</span> </p><p><span m='174850'>And it varies from x prime
  equals 0 to x prime equals L.</span> </p><p><span m='180020'>And that will
  show up in terms of the limits of my integral.</span> </p><p><span
  m='183760'>Now the second place that the integration variable comes in</span>
  <span m='188270'>is dm.</span> </p><p><span m='189320'>I want to express in
  terms of x prime,</span> <span m='193700'>which is a measure of where this
  object is.</span> </p><p><span m='196410'>And that's how, if we choose this
  length here</span> <span m='200579'>to be dx prime, notice in terms of the
  integration variable,</span> <span m='205430'>then I have a relationship
  between and dm and dx prime.</span> </p><p><span m='210600'>dm is mass in this
  little element.</span> </p><p><span m='213150'>dx prime is the length of the
  element.</span> </p><p><span m='215350'>And if the whole object is a uniform
  rod with a mass capital</span> <span m='220890'>M and a length L, then its
  just given by M over L dx prime.</span> </p><p><span m='228280'>And this
  quantity M over L is an example</span> <span m='232590'>of a mass, linear mass
  density, which we</span> <span m='235940'>have a scale challenge about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='237790'>So I have two places, where my integration</span>
  <span m='241530'>variable has been introduced.</span> </p><p><span
  m='244520'>And now I can write up every piece in this interval.</span>
  </p><p><span m='249280'>So let's now indicate that we're integrating</span>
  <span m='253580'>from x prime equals 0 to x prime equals</span> <span
  m='256839'>L. dm is M over L dx prime, and our vector is x prime i hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='267390'>And downstairs, it's just M over L dx</span> <span
  m='271730'>prime from x prime equals 0 to x prime equals L.</span>
  </p><p><span m='277710'>And that's how I set up the integral</span> <span
  m='280700'>for the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='282480'>Both of
  these integrals are now not difficult to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='286490'>Notice, it's x prime dx prime.</span> </p><p><span m='288670'>So
  this integral is x squared over 2.</span> </p><p><span m='292110'>And I get
  1/2 M over L, L squared.</span> </p><p><span m='298370'>And downstairs, dx
  prime from 0 to is just L.</span> </p><p><span m='302840'>So the downstairs
  integral is just M over L.</span> </p><p><span m='308610'>And when you have M
  over L's cancel,</span> <span m='312380'>we just are left with a-- this
  is--</span> <span m='317860'>I'm sorry-- this is just M not M over L,
  dimension incorrect.</span> </p><p><span m='323520'>So we get for the position
  of the center</span> <span m='326400'>of mass, the M's cancel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='328080'>One of the L's cancel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='329660'>And we have an i hat in this expression</span> <span m='333040'>so
  our answer is r equals L over 2 I hat, which</span> <span m='338460'>is
  exactly what we expected.</span> </p><p><span m='340360'>We expected the
  center of mass to be half way down the rod.</span> </p><p></p>
