title: 24.4 Newton's 2nd Law and Energy Conservation
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3580'>When solving physics problems, we have fundamental
  principles.</span> </p><p><span m='6760'>For instance, we have Newton's second
  law.</span> </p><p><span m='10030'>And we also have an energy
  principle,</span> <span m='12070'>work non-conservative equals the change in
  kinetic energy</span> <span m='16090'>plus the change in potential
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='18460'>And many times students are
  challenged</span> <span m='20440'>by-- do I use this law?</span> </p><p><span
  m='22170'>Do I use that law?</span> </p><p><span m='23420'>Why do I use one or
  the other?</span> </p><p><span m='25220'>Do I use both at the same
  time?</span> </p><p><span m='26710'>Can I get the same answers, et
  cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='28930'>Now I want to illustrate a particular
  category of problems</span> <span m='32280'>where we have some type of
  circular motion,</span> <span m='35650'>and why we need to use both of these
  laws.</span> </p><p><span m='38830'>So let's consider, let's go back to our
  dome example at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='45250'>And let's say we have an
  object that's on the dome.</span> </p><p><span m='49090'>And now let's write
  out a free body diagram for this object.</span> </p><p><span m='54610'>So we
  have our gravitational force.</span> </p><p><span m='58420'>We have a normal
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='60520'>And here, let's just assume that our dome
  is frictionless,</span> <span m='64390'>for simplicity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='67510'>So what you see here is that the object is displacing</span> <span
  m='74860'>in a direction-- now here if I choose r hat and theta hat,</span>
  <span m='81310'>and if I choose a coordinate system where</span> <span
  m='84070'>I take my positive angle theta this way,</span> <span m='86650'>that
  the normal force and the displacement are perpendicular.</span> </p><p><span
  m='92830'>Now what that means is that the work done by the normal
  force,</span> <span m='101860'>F normal dot ds is 0, because well,
  we're</span> <span m='107380'>calling F normal equal to the normal
  force</span> <span m='111670'>and that the normal force is perpendicular to
  displacement.</span> </p><p><span m='118430'>So what that means is all
  information</span> <span m='120850'>about the normal force is not included in
  the energy</span> <span m='125980'>principle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='126730'>In fact, the energy principle is-- the work</span> <span
  m='130000'>that's done is just the amount-- this is angle theta,</span> <span
  m='134690'>so this is angle theta-- so the actual work done</span> <span
  m='138520'>by the gravitational force g is the component of g mg sine</span>
  <span m='145510'>theta times the displacement ds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150520'>So the only work that's appearing here,</span> <span m='155240'>and
  this is conservative.</span> </p><p><span m='159230'>And so when we integrated
  this work</span> <span m='162010'>and got that the work done by the
  gravitational force</span> <span m='165280'>is minus the change in potential
  energy, that's showing up here.</span> </p><p><span m='170780'>So the part of
  the force that's in the direction of the motion</span> <span m='176530'>is
  giving us the energy condition.</span> </p><p><span m='180280'>But we're
  losing all information about the forces</span> <span m='183340'>in the radial
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='185210'>So because also what we need is
  Newton's second law</span> <span m='198160'>in the direction perpendicular to
  the displacement.</span> </p><p><span m='205600'>Displacement is in the theta
  hat direction,</span> <span m='208400'>so we need Newton's second law in the
  radial direction.</span> </p><p><span m='212290'>And that we have r hat, is we
  have a normal force</span> <span m='217300'>minus mg co-sine theta.</span>
  </p><p><span m='220420'>And the object is undergoing circular motion,</span>
  <span m='223930'>so it's equal to minus mv squared over R,</span> <span
  m='231760'>where R is the radius of the dome.</span> </p><p><span
  m='234850'>This equation is not at all included</span> <span m='238329'>in the
  energy condition.</span> </p><p><span m='239829'>You may say, well what about
  the tangential Newton's second law,</span> <span m='245330'>which is mg sine
  theta equals mR d squared theta dt squared.</span> </p><p><span m='255910'>But
  it's precisely this equation that's</span> <span m='259390'>integrated with
  respect to the displacement</span> <span m='269450'>and that gives us our
  energy principle.</span> </p><p><span m='275200'>So in summary, the energy
  principle</span> <span m='278250'>is the integration of Newton's second
  law</span> <span m='280650'>in the direction of motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='283140'>And we're completely missing the application</span> <span
  m='287610'>of Newton's second law in the direction perpendicular</span> <span
  m='290355'>to the motion.</span> </p><p><span m='291210'>Energy does not
  account for that.</span> </p><p><span m='293350'>And that's why we needed
  separately</span> <span m='296010'>to apply both of the principles of
  energy</span> <span m='300660'>and Newton's second law in the radial
  direction</span> <span m='303960'>in order to figure out how to solve this
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='307380'>Now this idea is true in general when
  you have circular motion,</span> <span m='311410'>you need the energy
  equation, which</span> <span m='312870'>is the tangentially integrated
  Newton's second</span> <span m='315040'>on the tangential direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='317110'>And you need Newton's second law in the direction
  perpendicular</span> <span m='321060'>to that circular motion.</span>
