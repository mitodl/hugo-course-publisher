  <p><span m='3772'>We would now like to calculate the potential function</span>
  <span m='5980'>for a universal law of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='8890'>So
  let's set up a coordinate system first.</span> </p><p><span m='11382'>And in
  this case, we're going to make a very special case--</span> <span
  m='13840'>although, the general result doesn't depend on that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='17200'>So suppose we have a planet of radius rp</span> <span
  m='21130'>and we have a small object.</span> </p><p><span m='23410'>And
  initially, our object is a distance r</span> <span m='25840'>away from the
  planet.</span> </p><p><span m='27130'>This is our initial state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='30070'>And the planet has mass to the planet.</span>
  </p><p><span m='32290'>And our small object has m.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34380'>And this object is moving.</span> </p><p><span m='35980'>Of course,
  orbits really aren't like that,</span> <span m='38320'>so we should be a
  little bit more careful.</span> </p><p><span m='40870'>But our orbit might be
  some type of hyperbolic section-- conic</span> <span m='46780'>section.</span>
  </p><p><span m='47950'>And the orbit over here is at some final
  position.</span> </p><p><span m='53830'>In our eyes, the distance from the
  object to the center</span> <span m='57790'>of the planet as our final
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='60750'>Now because there's a central point to this
  problem,</span> <span m='64390'>the natural coordinate system to use</span>
  <span m='66790'>is polar coordinates in the plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='70360'>And let's just imagine that at this moment</span> <span m='75100'>we
  have the universal force of gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='77890'>Here's our
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='79300'>And it's being displaced a distance
  s.</span> </p><p><span m='82630'>So our coordinate system is polar.</span>
  </p><p><span m='88420'>Let's call r hat this way and theta hat that
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='93970'>And let's blow up our little
  displacement</span> <span m='96490'>in terms of our coordinate system,</span>
  <span m='98259'>just so that we see what's happening.</span> </p><p><span
  m='100910'>So let's imagine that our little ds</span> <span m='110500'>vector
  is pointing like this.</span> </p><p><span m='114310'>And our center point
  here, we have tge r hat pointing</span> <span m='118900'>radially outward and
  the theta hat</span> <span m='122740'>pointing towards the center.</span>
  </p><p><span m='124470'>Now to exaggerate this picture, if this is r,</span>
  <span m='128620'>then the arc length here is rd theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='133030'>And the difference as the object moves from one</span> <span
  m='138610'>point here to a closer point towards the center, will be dr.</span>
  </p><p><span m='147142'>And so our ds vector, we can write as a radial piece r
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='152530'>Now, I don't put a sign in there,</span>
  <span m='154390'>because only the end points of my integral</span> <span
  m='156160'>will tell me whether I was going towards the planet</span> <span
  m='158290'>or away from the planet.</span> </p><p><span m='159660'>And rd
  theta, theta hat.</span> </p><p><span m='162670'>And our gravitational force
  is minus</span> <span m='165370'>g mass mass of the planet over the distance
  squared r hat.</span> </p><p><span m='170960'>So now what we see is that when
  we</span> <span m='173440'>take the dot product of these two forces,</span>
  <span m='176890'>r hat dot r hat is 1 in polar coordinates.</span>
  </p><p><span m='179920'>Why is that the case, r hat dot r hat is 1?</span>
  </p><p><span m='183490'>Because these vectors are in the same
  direction,</span> <span m='186970'>the angle between them is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='188830'>And remember, that any two vectors that are
  perpendicular</span> <span m='192550'>have dot product 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='194320'>r hat and theta hat are perpendicular.</span> </p><p><span
  m='197320'>And so r hat dot r hat is 1.</span> </p><p><span m='199550'>r hat
  dot theta hat is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='201420'>And so we only get minus
  GMP r squared dr.</span> </p><p><span m='209500'>And that's the first step in
  calculating</span> <span m='212740'>our potential difference because U of r
  final minus U of r</span> <span m='219310'>initial by definition is minus the
  work done in going</span> <span m='223840'>from the initial state to the final
  state, which</span> <span m='226990'>are described by these parameters r
  initial</span> <span m='228910'>and r final of F gravitation dot ds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='234130'>And now we have, actually, minus sign</span> <span
  m='238120'>in the definition, another minus sign coming from the dot</span>
  <span m='243040'>product.</span> </p><p><span m='244450'>And lets make this
  our integration variable,</span> <span m='246550'>r prime, r initial, r prime
  equals r final.</span> </p><p><span m='251489'>And there's going to be a third
  minus</span> <span m='253030'>sign because the integral of dr r prime squared
  is minus 1</span> <span m='257680'>over r prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m='260110'>So there would be 3 minus signs-- one</span> <span m='262210'>from
  the definition, one from the scalar product,</span> <span m='265150'>and one
  from the integration.</span> </p><p><span m='266860'>And so we get r final
  minus r initial equals 3 minus signs</span> <span m='272560'>given overall
  minus sign planet and planet</span> <span m='276770'>1 over r final minus 1
  over r initial.</span> </p><p><span m='281770'>So this is the change in
  gravitational potential energy</span> <span m='285460'>as my small object goes
  from some initial state</span> <span m='288760'>to some final state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='291770'>What about the potential function?</span> </p><p><span
  m='293350'>Where should we choose our reference point?</span> </p><p><span
  m='296590'>So our reference state here is a little bit unusual.</span>
  </p><p><span m='301750'>And it will be at infinity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='305590'>And we'll choose as a potential for our reference potential</span>
  <span m='309820'>to be 0 at infinity.</span> </p><p><span m='314050'>Imagine
  initial state very, very far away from the planet.</span> </p><p><span
  m='319630'>And we'll take us a final state, an arbitrary state,</span> <span
  m='325570'>just where the object is some distance r from the planet.</span>
  </p><p><span m='329560'>Now, we have to be a little bit careful,</span> <span
  m='331990'>because in this calculation our final state must always</span>
  <span m='336159'>be outside the planet.</span> </p><p><span m='338420'>And the
  reasons for that is subtle,</span> <span m='339940'>but the gravitational
  force inside the planet</span> <span m='342400'>is no longer minus g and 1 M2
  over r-squared.</span> </p><p><span m='346600'>So our analysis only applies
  for r bigger than r planet.</span> </p><p><span m='351890'>And if we put these
  values for r and infinity in here,</span> <span m='355930'>we get U of r minus
  the potential at our reference</span> <span m='360160'>point, which will be 0,
  equals minus GMNP.</span> </p><p><span m='365110'>And here's the reason why we
  choose</span> <span m='367240'>that reference point, 1 over r arbitrary state
  is just minus 1</span> <span m='372460'>over r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='373300'>But 1 over infinity, if we use the initial state</span> <span
  m='377950'>as the reference point, 1 over infinity is 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='380500'>So that's minus 0.</span> </p><p><span m='383470'>And so what we
  get is that the potential function</span> <span m='387550'>is equal to our
  reference potential--</span> <span m='391090'>actually, minus GM mass of the
  planet over r for r</span> <span m='397780'>bigger than our reference.</span>
  </p><p><span m='401380'>And that is the potential function</span> <span
  m='403990'>for the gravitational problem.</span> </p><p><span m='406760'>But
  now remember, we're choosing that to be our reference point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='411409'>And so the real conclusion is U of r equals minus
  GMN</span> <span m='416950'>planet over r with U at infinity equals to
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='425880'>Now, let's just finish this by saying in
  words</span> <span m='428820'>precisely what this means.</span> </p><p><span
  m='431770'>So if I start my system at infinity</span> <span m='435030'>and I
  end my system a distance r away from the planet,</span> <span m='439110'>and I
  calculate the work done by the gravitational force</span> <span m='443010'>in
  going from infinity to a distance r</span> <span m='445470'>away from the
  planet-- I take a minus that sign.</span> </p><p><span m='448630'>So the
  negative of the gravitational work--</span> <span m='451620'>then that's what
  that number corresponds to.</span> </p><p></p>
