transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3660'>I would now like to calculate the potential function for
  two</span> <span m='6180'>other conservative forces that we</span> <span
  m='7560'>encounter all the time, spring forces</span> <span m='10380'>and
  gravitational forces.</span> </p><p><span m='11880'>Will begin with spring
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='13440'>So first off, let's begin with some type
  of coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='17250'>Suppose we have a
  spring.</span> </p><p><span m='18990'>We have a block.</span> </p><p><span
  m='20400'>This is my point x equilibrium, unstretched</span> <span
  m='24330'>length of the spring.</span> </p><p><span m='25800'>And now whether
  we stretch it or compress it here,</span> <span m='28620'>I'll stretch
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='29880'>I'll introduce a coordinate function
  x.</span> </p><p><span m='32210'>Union vector i, and my spring force,
  f,</span> <span m='36720'>is -kxi, where x can be positive for a stretch
  spring,</span> <span m='42030'>force is in the negative i-hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='44270'>When x is negative, negative times
  negative,</span> <span m='47220'>means the spring force is in the positive
  i-hat direction when</span> <span m='51120'>it's compressed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='52110'>So this is a force that's a restoring force,</span>
  <span m='54330'>always back to equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='56160'>This
  is an example of a conservative force.</span> </p><p><span m='59340'>And now
  let's calculate the change in potential energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='63030'>And then introduce a zero reference point</span> <span m='65730'>and
  get a potential function for this force.</span> </p><p><span m='68140'>So the
  first calculation is straightforward.</span> </p><p><span m='71380'>So, if we
  took our displacement to be dx i-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='76260'>And we
  take the dot product of fds,</span> <span m='79950'>we get dx i-hat dot i-hat
  is 1, times dx.</span> </p><p><span m='85440'>And that's just the x component
  of the force displacement.</span> </p><p><span m='90360'>And minus sign
  because the x component of the force is -kx.</span> </p><p><span m='97180'>And
  so now, if we were to start our system,</span> <span m='100320'>so, again, for
  our initial state,</span> <span m='104840'>let's say that the block from the
  unstretched position,</span> <span m='112410'>is stretched xi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='115170'>And our final state, whether it's stretched or
  compressed,</span> <span m='118500'>it won't matter, but we'll just stretch it
  out a little bit</span> <span m='122970'>more to x-final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='126540'>So now let's calculate the change</span> <span m='129780'>in
  potential energy between our initial and our final states.</span> </p><p><span
  m='133800'>Now, recall there's a minus sign,</span> <span m='135840'>because
  it's -w conservative.</span> </p><p><span m='138780'>That's minus the integral
  x-initial to x-final of -kxdx.</span> </p><p><span m='148410'>We have 2 minus
  signs.</span> </p><p><span m='151620'>That's our integration variable, if
  you</span> <span m='153360'>want to see all the detail.</span> </p><p><span
  m='155520'>And when you simply integrate x-prime dx-prime,</span> <span
  m='158910'>you get x-prime squared over 2.</span> </p><p><span m='161130'>And
  so the change in potential energy between these two states</span> <span
  m='167220'>is 1/2 kx-final squared, minus 1/2 kx-initial squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='176220'>And that's physically meaningful if I take my system
  initially.</span> </p><p><span m='182410'>And the system ends up in the final
  state.</span> </p><p><span m='185820'>Then what I'm calculating is minus the
  work</span> <span m='188580'>done by the spring force on the block</span>
  <span m='192150'>as it goes from the initial state to the final state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='194700'>I'm not talking about the work that an external
  agent</span> <span m='197280'>does in stretching or compressing it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='199320'>This is explicitly the work done by the spring</span>
  <span m='203430'>force on the block as it goes from the initial state</span>
  <span m='206670'>to the final state.</span> </p><p><span m='208440'>I
  introduced the minus sign in our definition</span> <span m='210810'>of
  potential energy.</span> </p><p><span m='212340'>And so this quantity
  represents the negative</span> <span m='215730'>of the work done by the spring
  force</span> <span m='217980'>as a system goes from the initial to the final
  states.</span> </p><p><span m='221550'>Now, you may have already thought about
  it,</span> <span m='223800'>but the reference point that we're going to
  use</span> <span m='227370'>is x equals zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='229900'>The unstretched length of the spring.</span> </p><p><span
  m='232740'>And our reference potential at that point will be zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='237210'>So our reference point is actually the
  zero-point</span> <span m='241350'>for the potential.</span> </p><p><span
  m='244200'>And then our arbitrary state, we can call this</span> <span
  m='250870'>the referent state, if you like.</span> </p><p><span
  m='253630'>That's probably better than the reference point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='256680'>Our arbitrary state will be at some arbitrary</span>
  <span m='261430'>stretch or compress.</span> </p><p><span m='263710'>And our
  potential energy function,</span> <span m='266440'>at that reference, minus
  the potential energy</span> <span m='270550'>at the arbitrary state, minus the
  reference state.</span> </p><p><span m='273200'>Well, if we set xi equal to 0
  and x-final equal</span> <span m='277990'>to x, as we have in this
  expression,</span> <span m='280720'>we simply get 1/2 kx squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='284290'>So the potential energy function equals our reference
  potential,</span> <span m='289300'>plus 1/2 kx squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='291790'>And we have defined that our reference potential to be zero,</span>
  <span m='295150'>it could have been anything.</span> </p><p><span
  m='296680'>But we're making it 0 so that we get a nice function, 1/2 kx</span>
  <span m='302060'>square.</span> </p><p><span m='303430'>And again, it's always
  worthwhile to plot</span> <span m='306460'>that function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='308120'>It's a nice parabola.</span> </p><p><span m='310190'>U of x,
  x.</span> </p><p><span m='312370'>And you can see down here, that's our
  reference point.</span> </p>
