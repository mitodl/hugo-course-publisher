  <p><span m='3710'>In problem solving, when we're working</span> <span
  m='5410'>with problems with potential and kinetic energy,</span> <span
  m='8230'>remember we have our main concept</span> <span m='10600'>that the
  non-conservative work causes</span> <span m='13000'>potential energy and
  kinetic energy to change.</span> </p><p><span m='15880'>K final minus K
  initial plus U final minus U initial.</span> </p><p><span m='22510'>Now, how
  are we going to apply this in problem solving?</span> </p><p><span
  m='26020'>Well, what we'd like to introduce</span> <span m='27400'>is a tool,
  which we're going to refer to as our energy state</span> <span
  m='35858'>diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='39050'>So the way this works is--
  let's have an example to think about.</span> </p><p><span m='44240'>Suppose
  you have a dome.</span> </p><p><span m='48820'>So here's some dome.</span>
  </p><p><span m='52090'>We can think of this as the MIT Dome.</span>
  </p><p><span m='55540'>And you have an object that is initially</span> <span
  m='58720'>at the top of the dome.</span> </p><p><span m='60760'>And then this
  object is sliding down the dome</span> <span m='63280'>and at a later time
  it's at a point somewhere along the dome.</span> </p><p><span m='69010'>Now
  eventually it's going to fall off the dome,</span> <span m='71110'>but that's
  a separate question.</span> </p><p><span m='72970'>So how can we use our
  energy ideas</span> <span m='77140'>to analyze this situation?</span>
  </p><p><span m='78830'>And the way we do it is that we choose</span> <span
  m='83320'>first initial and final states that we're considering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='91240'>Because our first idea in the energy</span> <span
  m='92740'>diagram is to compare the change in kinetic energy</span> <span
  m='96400'>between the initial and change of potential energy</span> <span
  m='98560'>between the initial and the final states.</span> </p><p><span
  m='100570'>So in our dome problem, we would choose our initial state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='108610'>Let's draw our object at the top.</span> </p><p><span
  m='114310'>And in our final state, separately,</span> <span m='120020'>let's
  draw the object over here.</span> </p><p><span m='122260'>And then we want to
  parametrize these states</span> <span m='124990'>by some type of coordinate
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='127820'>So here we're going to have some type
  of coordinate system</span> <span m='131470'>that we use for both.</span>
  </p><p><span m='132920'>Energy is a scalar, so we don't have to worry about
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='136010'>And what I'll do is I'll define an angle
  theta final.</span> </p><p><span m='142930'>Here from the vertical, here theta
  initial is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='148390'>And I've now parametrized my
  initial and final states.</span> </p><p><span m='153970'>Now, the important
  thing that we'll do in the energy diagram</span> <span m='158090'>is to choose
  our 0 potential energy.</span> </p><p><span m='164980'>Where are we going to
  choose this?</span> </p><p><span m='167470'>So we could say either a surface--
  we'll</span> <span m='169860'>call that potential energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='173020'>And in this diagram, I can choose my 0</span> <span m='175150'>for
  potential energy anywhere I want.</span> </p><p><span m='176800'>But I want to
  draw it on my initial and my final states.</span> </p><p><span m='180530'>So
  I'm going to choose it right here,</span> <span m='183910'>and I'll denote
  this as u equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m='188230'>And now I can now make a
  list-- so I want to identify.</span> </p><p><span m='194520'>So step three is
  to identify the K and U for each state.</span> </p><p><span m='205220'>So here
  we have K initial, it's at rest 0.</span> </p><p><span m='209380'>And U
  initial, well, I didn't introduce a parameter</span> <span m='212540'>R. U
  initialize is how high the gravitational potential energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='220400'>So in this particular case, Mg times R.</span> </p><p><span
  m='224050'>Now over here, K final, is 1/2 M V final squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='229390'>And U final, we can denote it here if I plot this
  out--</span> <span m='235840'>and that's R. And then you can see that
  this</span> <span m='238210'>is R cosine theta final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='240860'>So that's MgR cosine theta final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='245830'>Now, the fourth step is to identify W non-conservative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='251350'>Is there any non-conservative work?</span>
  </p><p><span m='253510'>Now, here let's assume the dome is
  frictionless.</span> </p><p><span m='262790'>And that means that W
  non-conservative is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='266450'>And our last step 5 is
  we can apply the energy</span> <span m='270230'>principle, which is W
  non-conservative</span> <span m='277970'>equals delta K-- let's write out
  everything explicit</span> <span m='283909'>now that we've defined K final--
  minus K initial plus U</span> <span m='288860'>final minus U initial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='290900'>And you see the power of these diagrams and this
  methodology</span> <span m='294980'>is we've now defined very explicitly every
  single term</span> <span m='298909'>that appears in the energy
  principle.</span> </p><p><span m='300920'>And so we can write out our result
  that 0 K final,</span> <span m='307100'>1/2 M V final squared, K initial, 0
  plus U</span> <span m='311420'>final, MgR cosine theta final, minus U initial,
  MgR, and there</span> <span m='322760'>we have applied the energy
  principle</span> <span m='325250'>using the tool of energy diagrams.</span>
