title: 25.3 Reading Potential Energy Diagrams
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3130'>There's even a little bit more that we can</span> <span
  m='5890'>learn about our energy diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='9560'>And I'd
  like to just clean this diagram up for a little second,</span> <span
  m='15280'>because I want to work in this area.</span> </p><p><span
  m='17320'>Suppose our system, because the work non-conservative is 0,</span>
  <span m='23200'>tells us that the mechanical energy is constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='29860'>Now we don't know how much mechanical energy our
  system</span> <span m='32570'>is.</span> </p><p><span m='33070'>That's a
  constant of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='34780'>But let's just suppose
  that our mechanical energy</span> <span m='39010'>is written like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='43730'>And we'll just clean up a little,</span> <span
  m='45940'>give ourselves a little space.</span> </p><p><span m='49270'>So here
  is the mechanical energy of the system,</span> <span m='53140'>and that's a
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='55160'>And now we can talk about two more
  special points.</span> </p><p><span m='60510'>A point over here, and at this
  point,</span> <span m='66380'>let's just think about what our mechanical
  energy tells us.</span> </p><p><span m='71560'>This is a special point, but
  let's begin with one</span> <span m='74530'>right here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='75510'>If our particle is at this location,</span> <span m='78970'>then
  this represents the potential energy</span> <span m='82690'>and the difference
  between the energy and the potential energy</span> <span m='87520'>is the
  kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='89840'>So this here represents the
  kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='96420'>And now we can ask ourselves
  what</span> <span m='98920'>would happen to the energies as our particle is
  moving?</span> </p><p><span m='103670'>So if we start right here, the kinetic
  energy is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='108340'>Because all the potential
  energy,</span> <span m='110620'>all the energy is potential.</span>
  </p><p><span m='112750'>And as a particle starts to move,</span> <span
  m='116450'>let's say it has a little bit of energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='119590'>It starts to move in this direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='121760'>Then the kinetic energy starts to increase</span> <span
  m='126250'>until we get to this point, where the kinetic energy is</span>
  <span m='131020'>maximum at the stable equilibrium</span> <span
  m='133930'>point where the force is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='137060'>Now the
  kinetic energy decreases because remember,</span> <span m='140290'>it's now
  going against the force.</span> </p><p><span m='142650'>The side the force was
  pointing in that direction.</span> </p><p><span m='147020'>Here it was in the
  other direction.</span> </p><p><span m='150340'>And until we finally get to
  this point</span> <span m='153550'>where, again, the energy of system</span>
  <span m='157660'>is equal to all potential energy,</span> <span m='160329'>and
  so there is no kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='162790'>So I'll call
  this point A, and I'll</span> <span m='166930'>refer to this point over here,
  diagram</span> <span m='170440'>is getting a little crowded, as B.</span>
  </p><p><span m='174550'>And those points A and B are what</span> <span
  m='181930'>we call the turnaround points.</span> </p><p><span m='186400'>And
  they represent the places where the kinetic energy at XA</span> <span
  m='191380'>is equal to the kinetic energy at XB, which is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='196750'>Now the last thing that we like--</span> <span
  m='200530'>there's a lot of information, as you can see,</span> <span
  m='203110'>contained in these energy diagrams.</span> </p><p><span
  m='206630'>And the last bit of information that we'd like to ask
  ourselves</span> <span m='210070'>is what would happen if instead of having--
  confining</span> <span m='214570'>our system to this area, we increased our
  mechanical energy</span> <span m='220760'>so we're up here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='224770'>And let's just follow qualitatively</span> <span
  m='227680'>the motion of a particle that begins</span> <span m='231190'>say,
  over here, with a little bit of kinetic energy</span> <span m='236020'>and
  potential energy.</span> </p><p><span m='238310'>And if the particle starts
  off with the velocity</span> <span m='241930'>in the positive x direction,
  then it's</span> <span m='244150'>going to move in this direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='246100'>And you can see the kinetic energy is
  increasing.</span> </p><p><span m='250450'>Here we have a maximum amount of
  kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='253990'>But notice that over here the
  particle still</span> <span m='257620'>has some positive kinetic
  energy,</span> <span m='260709'>and so it can get over this hill.</span>
  </p><p><span m='263440'>And when it gets to the other side,</span> <span
  m='266260'>the force was in the positive direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='268630'>It increases its kinetic energy, and it goes off</span> <span
  m='271780'>to what we're referring to as infinity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='275560'>So one analogy that people like to make</span> <span m='279820'>is
  to understand the motion, think of a marble that's</span> <span
  m='284650'>rolling down a hill.</span> </p><p><span m='286360'>And this is
  just a metaphor for this potential energy function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='290230'>As the marble rolls down the hill, it gains kinetic energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='294850'>It loses potential energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='296890'>It comes maximum at the bottom of the hill.</span> </p><p><span
  m='299500'>As it goes up the hill, it still has enough kinetic energy</span>
  <span m='303280'>to get over the top of the hill and to start</span> <span
  m='306970'>to come down the other side.</span> </p><p><span m='310360'>And of
  course, our particle can never</span> <span m='312250'>get to the speed of
  light.</span> </p><p><span m='313900'>So our model has to break off at one
  point.</span> </p><p></p>
