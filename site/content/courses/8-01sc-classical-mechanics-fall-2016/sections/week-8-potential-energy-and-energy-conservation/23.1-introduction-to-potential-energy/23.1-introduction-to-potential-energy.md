  <p><span m='3420'>We're now going to introduce the concept of potential
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='7030'>Let's begin by considering a system
  where</span> <span m='8850'>a conservative force is acting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='11480'>So I'll consider a conservative force, which I'll call
  F sub c.</span> </p><p><span m='21780'>So force set to force, the work
  integral is path independent.</span> </p><p><span m='27610'>So the work
  integral for this force is the integral of F sub</span> <span m='33740'>c .ds,
  which is the path going from point A to point B.</span> </p><p><span
  m='40890'>And for a conservative force, this integral does not depend</span>
  <span m='44730'>upon the path from A to B. It's independent of A and B.</span>
  </p><p><span m='47670'>So it depends only upon the endpoints.</span>
  </p><p><span m='52720'>So this is a path independent integral.</span>
  </p><p><span m='61110'>And since it depends only upon the endpoints,</span>
  <span m='63480'>I can write it, since it's going to be an integral from point
  A</span> <span m='67170'>to point B-- this integral must be</span> <span
  m='69270'>equal to some function of the final point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='72890'>So some function of r sub B minus some function</span> <span
  m='84450'>of the initial point r sub A. And to just get this integral</span>
  <span m='89340'>from A to B, in our usual way of evaluating a definite
  integral,</span> <span m='93690'>it's going to be equal to some function of
  r</span> <span m='95865'>B minus some function of r A, since the integral
  depends only</span> <span m='100080'>upon the endpoints.</span> </p><p><span
  m='102370'>Now, let's call this function-- I'm</span> <span m='105039'>going
  to make a sort of funny choice here-- so let's</span> <span m='111390'>call
  this function minus U as a function of position factor r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='121740'>And we'll see the reason for this funny choice of minus sign</span>
  <span m='126060'>in just a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='127650'>So now with
  this definition, my work integral, which again,</span> <span m='136200'>is the
  integral of F sub c .ds from point A to point B is now</span> <span
  m='146310'>minus U of r B minus minus U of r A. So in other words,</span>
  <span m='153070'>that's minus U of r B-- so minus minus gives me a plus U of
  r</span> <span m='164880'>sub A.</span> </p><p><span m='167040'>For shorthand,
  I can write that as minus U sub B plus U sub A.</span> </p><p><span
  m='180330'>And since we start out at point A and go to point B,</span> <span
  m='186210'>notice that I can also write this</span> <span m='187800'>as the
  negative of the change in U. Since the final value of U</span> <span
  m='196640'>is r U at B and the initial value is U at A,</span> <span
  m='200310'>so this minus U B plus U A is equal to minus delta</span> <span
  m='206220'>U, the change in U as we go from the initial</span> <span
  m='208650'>to the final position.</span> </p><p><span m='211200'>And note that
  in addition to that, given that this</span> <span m='218160'>is the work
  integral, I can summarize that</span> <span m='220500'>by writing that-- so
  I'll say, note</span> <span m='224460'>that delta U is equal to the negative
  of the work done</span> <span m='234260'>going from point A to point B.
  Now,</span> <span m='238340'>let's write the work kinetic energy theorem using
  this newly</span> <span m='243470'>introduced U function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='245360'>So the work kinetic energy theorem,</span> <span m='252990'>which
  tells us that the work done, which we've seen</span> <span m='258200'>is minus
  U sub B plus U sub A is equal to the change</span> <span m='267380'>in kinetic
  energy delta k, which I can write as K sub B minus K</span> <span
  m='276820'>sub A. Or I could also write that as 1/2 M V B squared</span> <span
  m='285530'>minus 1/2 M V A squared.</span> </p><p><span m='290060'>So this is
  just me stating that the work done on the system</span> <span m='294050'>is
  equal to the change in kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='296470'>And I
  can write the work in terms of my function U</span> <span m='298940'>that I've
  introduced here to minus U sub B plus U sub A.</span> </p><p><span
  m='303950'>So I'm going to rearrange this equation now--</span> <span
  m='307160'>basically the one involving U's and the one involving</span> <span
  m='309650'>kinetic energies-- so that I have all the terms involving</span>
  <span m='313610'>point A on one side and all the terms involving</span> <span
  m='316760'>point B on the other side.</span> </p><p><span m='318780'>So
  rearranging, I get that at point A 1/2 M V</span> <span m='330038'>A squared
  plus U sub A is equal to at point B 1/2 M V B squared</span> <span
  m='342730'>plus U sub B. Now, notice however,</span> <span m='347870'>that
  there is nothing special about how</span> <span m='350590'>I chose the points
  A and B. They're completely arbitrary.</span> </p><p><span m='355580'>So that
  means that this equation must</span> <span m='358240'>be true for any points A
  and B.</span> </p><p><span m='362260'>And what that means is that each
  side</span> <span m='365950'>must be equal to the same constant</span> <span
  m='368500'>for any point in the system.</span> </p><p><span m='370700'>So in
  fact, we can write that K plus U for any point</span> <span m='386860'>must be
  able to some constant, which</span> <span m='388750'>I'm going to call E sub
  mech.</span> </p><p><span m='394990'>So K here is the kinetic energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='398360'>U is my function that I introduced,</span> <span
  m='403040'>and we're going to call it the potential energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='410930'>And E sub mech-- and remember, this E sub mech</span>
  <span m='417270'>here is a constant.</span> </p><p><span m='421720'>E sub mech
  is something that we call</span> <span m='424350'>the total mechanical
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='433110'>Now, what we've done here is that
  we've</span> <span m='435830'>shown that the total mechanical energy,
  which</span> <span m='439040'>is the sum of the kinetic energy and the
  potential energy,</span> <span m='442460'>is a constant under the action of a
  conservative force.</span> </p><p><span m='447680'>In other words, if we look
  at this equation</span> <span m='449810'>and look at how it changes with
  time,</span> <span m='456140'>the change in the kinetic energy, plus the
  change</span> <span m='460880'>in the potential energy is equal to the
  change</span> <span m='464720'>in the total mechanical energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='467030'>And this is 0 for our conservative force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='477690'>So in other words, the change in kinetic energy</span>
  <span m='480410'>is balanced by the change in potential energy, such</span>
  <span m='483200'>that the sum is 0 when the force acting is
  conservative.</span> </p><p><span m='488310'>Now, we've now introduced the
  very important concept</span> <span m='491870'>of the potential energy that is
  associated</span> <span m='494420'>with the conservative force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='496100'>And we see that the change in the potential
  energy,</span> <span m='498500'>the way we defined it, the change in potential
  energy</span> <span m='502100'>is equal to the negative of the work
  integral</span> <span m='505250'>for our conservative force going from point
  A</span> <span m='507440'>to point B. Now in fact, it's actually</span> <span
  m='511310'>only the change in the potential energy</span> <span
  m='513710'>that has physical significance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='515640'>We'll be concerned with potential energy differences</span> <span
  m='518030'>or changes.</span> </p><p><span m='519169'>The actual value of the
  potential energy</span> <span m='521929'>itself doesn't matter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='523039'>We're free to choose any convenient reference</span>
  <span m='526430'>point, or 0 point, for measuring the potential energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='529790'>It's equivalent to choosing a coordinate origin
  when</span> <span m='532580'>we're talking about positions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='535120'>Now, the potential energy change is</span> <span
  m='536870'>related to the work done by conservative forces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='541200'>But we know that in general, work</span> <span
  m='543230'>can also be done by non-conservative forces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='545810'>Although, that work by non-conservative forces</span> <span
  m='548750'>will depend upon the path taken from point A to point B.</span>
  </p><p><span m='552590'>So in general, the total work is given</span> <span
  m='557000'>by the sum of the conservative work--</span> <span m='560930'>the
  work done by conservative forces, which</span> <span m='562730'>we can relate
  to a potential energy change,</span> <span m='565670'>and the non-conservative
  work done.</span> </p><p><span m='569060'>And it's this total work that tells
  us</span> <span m='571940'>what the change in the kinetic energy is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='576320'>Now we'll soon see that in the presence</span> <span
  m='578420'>of non-conservative forces, the total mechanical energy,
  which</span> <span m='582350'>is K plus U, is not a constant.</span>
