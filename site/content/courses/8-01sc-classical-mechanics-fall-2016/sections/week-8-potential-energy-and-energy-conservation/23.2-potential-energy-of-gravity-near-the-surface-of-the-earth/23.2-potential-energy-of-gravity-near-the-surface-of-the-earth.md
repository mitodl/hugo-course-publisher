  <p><span m='3360'>We now would like to explore the concept of potential
  energy</span> <span m='5970'>difference for a conservative force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='7860'>Let's consider the following case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='10090'>Suppose you have an object of mass m</span> <span m='13200'>and it's
  located at a certain height y i initial.</span> </p><p><span m='17700'>And so
  this is our initial state.</span> </p><p><span m='21120'>And we would like to
  move this object upwards.</span> </p><p><span m='24870'>So it goes up to a
  height y final.</span> </p><p><span m='27930'>This is our final state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='30770'>And in our initial state, we might</span> <span
  m='32340'>have some initial velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='35250'>And then
  the final state might have some final speed.</span> </p><p><span m='39486'>And
  what we'd like to do now is--</span> <span m='40860'>we know that if there is
  a gravitational force, mg,</span> <span m='45330'>acting downwards, that this
  gravitational force is</span> <span m='47880'>a conservative force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49780'>And now what I'd like to do is-- because the force
  is</span> <span m='52860'>conservative, it doesn't depend on the path</span>
  <span m='56130'>that our object goes to the final state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='58860'>It just depends on the parameters</span> <span m='60570'>that
  describe the initial and the final states.</span> </p><p><span m='63550'>In
  fact, we'll see it only depends on the initial height</span> <span
  m='67020'>and the final height.</span> </p><p><span m='68530'>So what I'd like
  to do is define a potential energy difference</span> <span m='72000'>in the
  following way.</span> </p><p><span m='73630'>So as a definition, the potential
  energy difference</span> <span m='79800'>between these two points is
  given</span> <span m='83310'>by the negative of the work done by the
  gravitational force</span> <span m='88830'>in going from the initial state to
  the final state.</span> </p><p><span m='92910'>Notice this negative
  sign.</span> </p><p><span m='97440'>Because the gravitational force here,
  Fg</span> <span m='100800'>is minus mg j hat-- where we're taking j hat
  up--</span> <span m='106530'>we've seen that this is an example</span> <span
  m='108720'>of a conservative force.</span> </p><p><span m='113250'>And it
  doesn't matter how we went from the initial</span> <span m='115590'>to the
  final states.</span> </p><p><span m='116970'>So we can generalize this idea
  for potential energy.</span> </p><p><span m='120540'>But first, let's just
  remind ourselves of the calculation.</span> </p><p><span m='123600'>When we
  did this calculation before,</span> <span m='125640'>we had u final minus u
  final initial equals a negative sign</span> <span m='130889'>in the
  definition.</span> </p><p><span m='132210'>And when we calculated the work
  done by the conservative force,</span> <span m='135990'>we had negative mg y
  final minus y initial.</span> </p><p><span m='141050'>Notice the two minus
  signs.</span> </p><p><span m='142430'>So we get mg y final minus y
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='147510'>Now, many times people talk about
  changes</span> <span m='150570'>in potential energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='152050'>So when I write delta u, I mean precisely the potential
  energy</span> <span m='157320'>at the final state minus potential
  energy</span> <span m='159180'>of the initial state-- the change in potential
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='162010'>And that's equal to mg times the change
  in the displacement.</span> </p><p><span m='167520'>And so we see here for
  this example,</span> <span m='169800'>that if delta y is positive, that</span>
  <span m='173190'>implies that the potential energy is increasing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='176680'>Now let's connect that to our definition.</span>
  </p><p><span m='179220'>Why is the potential energy increasing</span> <span
  m='181770'>when we raise something?</span> </p><p><span m='183240'>Well, the
  gravitational force points downwards.</span> </p><p><span m='187050'>The
  displacement is upwards.</span> </p><p><span m='188860'>So the work done is
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='191040'>And another minus sign means the
  change in potential energy</span> <span m='193950'>is positive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='195300'>If the object is moving with no change in
  height,</span> <span m='200730'>that tells us that the potential energy is
  change is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='204390'>And finally, if delta y is less
  than zero,</span> <span m='207210'>that implies that the change in potential
  energy is negative.</span> </p><p><span m='210730'>Now again let's examine
  this case.</span> </p><p><span m='213340'>If we were actually lowering an
  object, dropping it down.</span> </p><p><span m='217290'>The object moved
  downward from the initial state</span> <span m='219360'>to a final state, the
  gravitational force</span> <span m='221475'>is downward, the displacement is
  downward,</span> <span m='224070'>the integral is positive, the extra minus
  sign</span> <span m='226829'>corresponds to the change of potential
  energy</span> <span m='228810'>being negative.</span> </p>
