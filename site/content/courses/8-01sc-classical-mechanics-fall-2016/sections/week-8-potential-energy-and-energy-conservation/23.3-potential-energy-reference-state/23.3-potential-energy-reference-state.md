title: 23.3 Potential Energy Reference State
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3830'>Now that we've calculated the change in potential
  energy</span> <span m='7280'>between some initial and final heights</span>
  <span m='11120'>for the gravitational problem, mg of y final minus y
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='18080'>For this conservative force of
  gravity,</span> <span m='23240'>and we had our coordinate system like
  that,</span> <span m='25460'>we were able to calculate the change in potential
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='28890'>And remember our theorem is that
  non-conservative work equals</span> <span m='34970'>Delta K plus Delta
  U.</span> </p><p><span m='38240'>Now what we'd like to do is establish</span>
  <span m='40250'>the concept of a reference point for potential energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='44540'>And we'll do that as follows, see</span> <span
  m='47240'>the change in potential energy only depended</span> <span
  m='50480'>on say, our initial state and our final state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56690'>What we'd like to do is introduce the concept</span> <span
  m='59030'>of a reference point.</span> </p><p><span m='60380'>So let's
  identify some point Yp to be our reference point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='68520'>And we'll define a potential Yp to be the reference
  potential.</span> </p><p><span m='77180'>And if we want to talk about the
  potential energy</span> <span m='80660'>in a final state, we'll always refer
  it</span> <span m='84289'>to the difference between that and the reference
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='88710'>So this is Delta U between the final
  state and the reference</span> <span m='92810'>point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='93890'>Likewise, for the initial state, we'll</span> <span m='96920'>always
  refer that with respect to our reference point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='100970'>So any state that we have, we can always</span> <span
  m='104390'>refer the potential energy difference between some state</span>
  <span m='109130'>and some reference point.</span> </p><p><span m='110570'>Why
  do we do this?</span> </p><p><span m='111890'>Because notice that if we look
  at U final minus U reference</span> <span m='119000'>point, and we subtract
  from that U initial minus U reference</span> <span m='125840'>point, then the
  difference-- the reference</span> <span m='130550'>points here we have a
  minus, here we have a plus--</span> <span m='132980'>this is just equal to U
  final minus U</span> <span m='136190'>initial, which is Delta U.</span>
  </p><p><span m='139310'>So the change in potential energy between any two
  states</span> <span m='143630'>is independent of how we choose our reference
  potential.</span> </p><p><span m='147530'>But it can make calculations
  easier</span> <span m='150470'>when we can identify what the potential energy
  is</span> <span m='152960'>for a little state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='153800'>Now let's look at our example.</span> </p><p><span m='156290'>So
  for our gravitational problem we</span> <span m='158630'>will choose y
  reference point to be 0.</span> </p><p><span m='163550'>And we'll choose the
  potential energy at this reference point</span> <span m='169190'>also to be
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='170300'>So our reference potential at the origin is
  0,</span> <span m='174260'>and I'll denote it like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='176720'>Then the potential energy at some initial state</span> <span
  m='181940'>minus the reference point-- well,</span> <span m='184310'>we can
  use our formula here, because this</span> <span m='187670'>is between any two
  states.</span> </p><p><span m='190380'>So this is mg y initial minus the
  reference point.</span> </p><p><span m='197240'>But our reference point was 0,
  and so we</span> <span m='200150'>see that U initial minus y reference point,
  which was also</span> <span m='205040'>0, is just equal to mg Yi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='209700'>And so we have this statement that the potential
  energy</span> <span m='212540'>difference between our initial state and the
  reference point</span> <span m='218660'>is just mg where Yi is the
  height</span> <span m='223230'>that the initial state is above the reference
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='226270'>In a similar way, we have U final is mg
  y final.</span> </p><p><span m='231890'>And so we see we recover what we
  expect.</span> </p><p><span m='234860'>This is just mg y final minus y
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='240740'>Now this we can generalize just a
  little bit</span> <span m='243890'>by saying that for any-- let's write</span>
  <span m='249590'>that for us our mass, which is for any height y</span> <span
  m='258769'>our potential energy function for the gravitational force</span>
  <span m='261649'>U(y) is equal to mg y.</span> </p><p><span m='265370'>That's
  a formula that many of you have seen before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='268400'>But it's very important to note that with this formula, U of
  0</span> <span m='273650'>equals 0, because that's our reference point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='276780'>And that becomes our potential energy function</span>
  <span m='281400'>for the gravitational force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='283860'>Now our next step will be to do the same thing</span> <span
  m='287630'>for spring forces and inverse square gravitational forces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='292250'>And we'll also look at graphical analysis of this
  function.</span> </p><p></p>
