  <p><span m='3530'>Let's consider an example of motion, in which we want</span>
  <span m='6750'>to use our energy concepts.</span> </p><p><span m='8760'>So
  suppose we have a ramp which is circular, radius r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='14850'>And we have an object here.</span> </p><p><span m='17030'>And now,
  here's a surface a certain distance,</span> <span m='21370'>d, that has
  friction, where the coefficients of friction</span> <span m='28530'>is
  non-uniform.</span> </p><p><span m='30470'>So we'll write it mu-0 And we'll
  write it as mu-1x.</span> </p><p><span m='35045'>We'll take x equals
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='37560'>And then here, there's a spring and a
  wall.</span> </p><p><span m='46680'>And here there is no friction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49830'>Now as we drop, assuming we have enough height here,
  h,</span> <span m='56130'>so that this block will slide across the
  friction,</span> <span m='58590'>make it all the way across and start
  compressing its spring.</span> </p><p><span m='62250'>What I'd like to find is
  how much</span> <span m='66360'>the spring has been compressed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='75220'>OK, now how do we analyze this?</span> </p><p><span
  m='77440'>Well the key is to use our energy principle,</span> <span
  m='81280'>where we have w-external equals the change</span> <span m='86710'>in
  mechanical energy.</span> </p><p><span m='89920'>And the key is to, what we're
  going</span> <span m='92289'>to do is the tool that we're going to use</span>
  <span m='94060'>is what we call energy diagrams for the initial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='101979'>So what does this mean?</span> </p><p><span
  m='103780'>We want to choose, we want to first identify</span> <span
  m='107600'>the initial and final states that we're referring to.</span>
  </p><p><span m='113360'>So, in our picture, here is our initial state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='119229'>And I'll draw the final state in when the spring has
  been</span> <span m='123760'>compressed a distance, x-final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='128470'>So I drew it on my diagram.</span> </p><p><span
  m='132640'>So we have initial and final states.</span> </p><p><span
  m='134920'>And now what we want to do is choose</span> <span
  m='139720'>reference points, zero-points, zero-point</span> <span
  m='144910'>for each potential function.</span> </p><p><span m='151040'>And
  show that on our diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='153720'>So for the potential
  energy of gravity, here,</span> <span m='157670'>if we chose this to be y,
  then this y equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m='164390'>And u at y equals 0 is
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='168740'>And we'll call that the zero point for
  gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='171829'>And the zero point for the
  spring</span> <span m='174590'>is when this x, now I'm going to call here x
  equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m='180530'>So, let's call this a variable, I can
  call it anything I want.</span> </p><p><span m='188240'>I'll call it
  u-final.</span> </p><p><span m='191900'>And this is where u is zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='197300'>So u-final just measures the stretch of the
  spring.</span> </p><p><span m='202220'>And so at y equals 0 is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='206300'>And u spring little u equal 0, 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211610'>So now I can identify my energies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='215280'>So let's talk about the initial energy</span> <span m='218030'>is
  all gravitational potential.</span> </p><p><span m='221090'>That's mgy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='223190'>It's starting at rest.</span> </p><p><span
  m='226550'>And e-final well, here, this is the distance</span> <span
  m='231800'>where it comes to rest, also.</span> </p><p><span m='233990'>So
  there's no final kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='236280'>There's no
  gravitational potential energy,</span> <span m='238470'>because we're on the
  surface at y equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m='240560'>But our spring has been
  compressed</span> <span m='242330'>by 1/2 k little-u-final square.</span>
  </p><p><span m='248180'>Now, in terms of our external work</span> <span
  m='252580'>equals the change in mechanical energy,</span> <span m='256010'>we
  have now identified the right-hand side</span> <span m='258860'>using these
  tools of the energy diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='261769'>And I can write
  my description u-final squared, minus mgy.</span> </p><p><span m='267500'>Now
  what I have to do is think about the friction</span> <span m='270710'>force, f
  kinetic friction, as the object moves.</span> </p><p><span m='276380'>This
  friction force is non-uniform.</span> </p><p><span m='279140'>If we were to
  draw n, and mg, then our friction force here</span> <span m='287780'>is equal
  to the integral minus the integral from x equals 0,</span> <span m='293000'>to
  x equals d.</span> </p><p><span m='295730'>Equals 0 to x equal d, of the
  friction force,</span> <span m='300540'>which is equal to the coefficient of
  friction, ukndx.</span> </p><p><span m='308720'>Now that 0 to d, notice that
  our coefficient of friction</span> <span m='316130'>is varying.</span>
  </p><p><span m='317380'>And I chose it intentionally to show you that
  friction</span> <span m='319910'>is really an integral.</span> </p><p><span
  m='321590'>So we have mu-0 plus mu-1 xmgdx.</span> </p><p><span
  m='330710'>Let's put our integration variable in there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='333470'>And these are just two separate integrals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='335310'>The first one is easy.</span> </p><p><span m='337159'>It's minus
  mu-0 mgd.</span> </p><p><span m='340430'>And the second one is -mu-1
  mg.</span> </p><p><span m='344870'>And we're just integrating x-prime, dx
  prime</span> <span m='347900'>between 0 and d.</span> </p><p><span
  m='349580'>So that's simply d-squared over 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='353870'>And that's equal to ku-final squared minus mgy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='359420'>Let's write that as y-initial.</span> </p><p><span m='363370'>And
  we're starting it at y-initial equals h.</span> </p><p><span m='367340'>And
  so, even though this is complicated,</span> <span m='370280'>I can now solve
  for how much this spring has been compressed</span> <span m='374180'>with a
  little bit of algebra.</span> </p><p><span m='375672'>And so I'm just going to
  bring a bunch of terms</span> <span m='377630'>over to the other side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='379280'>And take the square root of 2, divided by k of
  mgy-initial.</span> </p><p><span m='390230'>Minus mu-0 mgd.</span>
  </p><p><span m='395659'>Minus mu-1 mgd-squared over 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='402300'>And that's how much the spring is compressed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='406370'>Notice what I did not do was divide this up</span> <span
  m='409340'>into a bunch of different motions.</span> </p><p><span m='411110'>I
  picked an initial state.</span> </p><p><span m='413090'>I picked a final
  state.</span> </p><p><span m='414830'>I drew my energy diagrams with my zero
  points.</span> </p><p><span m='418310'>I described the key parameters of
  initial and final states,</span> <span m='421750'>y-i and u-final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='424630'>I defined the initial mechanical energy,</span> <span
  m='428060'>the final mechanical energy.</span> </p><p><span m='430280'>And
  then applied the work energy,</span> <span m='432670'>work mechanical energy
  principle.</span> </p><p><span m='434990'>I had to integrate the friction
  force because it</span> <span m='437030'>was non-trivial and solve for how
  much the spring has</span> <span m='441800'>been compressed.</span> </p>
