  <p><span m='3650'>Now that we've introduced mechanical energy</span> <span
  m='5540'>in our potential energy functions,</span> <span m='7320'>we're
  describing our systems differently.</span> </p><p><span m='9380'>We talk about
  states.</span> </p><p><span m='10760'>We talk about the potential energy of
  that state.</span> </p><p><span m='12920'>We talk about the mechanical energy
  of that state.</span> </p><p><span m='15560'>Remember we're always referring
  to a reference state</span> <span m='17780'>for a reference potential.</span>
  </p><p><span m='19820'>But in one dimension, what we have</span> <span
  m='22490'>is that the potential energy say,</span> <span m='24740'>in some
  final state, minus the change of potential energies</span> <span
  m='28370'>from some initial state was that integral x final</span> <span
  m='32119'>of the x component of-- I'm going</span> <span m='34760'>to put c up
  there for conservative force, dx.</span> </p><p><span m='38960'>And now, so
  the potential energy difference</span> <span m='43460'>is the integral of the
  force with the minus sign.</span> </p><p><span m='47000'>Now let's look at a
  fundamental theorem</span> <span m='49130'>of calculus, which tells us that
  any time you</span> <span m='52760'>take the difference of a function between
  two end</span> <span m='55690'>points, then by definition that's</span> <span
  m='58490'>the derivative integrated with respect to dx.</span> </p><p><span
  m='63080'>So when we compare these two pictures, this is a map here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='69140'>This is our physics, how we define them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='72190'>That when we compare these two pictures,</span> <span
  m='74570'>we see that we can recover the conservative force</span> <span
  m='78560'>by taking the derivative minus the derivative</span> <span
  m='82160'>of the potential function.</span> </p><p><span m='84130'>Here, force
  does not depend on any reference point.</span> </p><p><span m='88230'>And when
  we differentiate a constant, that's 0.</span> </p><p><span m='90830'>So this
  is independent of the reference point.</span> </p><p><span m='96660'>And this
  enables us to, when we think</span> <span m='99710'>about the potential
  function and its first derivative,</span> <span m='104060'>then this tells us
  about forces.</span> </p><p><span m='107539'>Let's look at an example.</span>
  </p><p><span m='108930'>Suppose again we look at our spring potential</span>
  <span m='112910'>where we're talking about the potential energy</span> <span
  m='114950'>function of a spring where at our zero</span> <span
  m='118009'>point where it was unstretched was our reference point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='122020'>And if we plotted this function-- so let's</span>
  <span m='125060'>plot that function.</span> </p><p><span m='128759'>So here is
  U of x versus x.</span> </p><p><span m='132410'>Now we can talk about at any
  given point--</span> <span m='136560'>so suppose we're at a point here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='140900'>Maybe our energy has some fixed value.</span>
  </p><p><span m='145100'>Then the slope at this point is equal to du dx,</span>
  <span m='151880'>and the force is minus that slope.</span> </p><p><span
  m='156060'>So here you can see that the slope is positive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='160590'>So the force is negative.</span> </p><p><span m='162150'>So I can
  write Fx like that.</span> </p><p><span m='165440'>So here Fx is negative, so
  our actual force</span> <span m='169460'>is pointing inward.</span>
  </p><p><span m='170960'>When we're on this side of the potential
  function,</span> <span m='175490'>my slope is negative.</span> </p><p><span
  m='178430'>So the x component of the force is positive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='181460'>So my force is pointing everywhere on this side</span> <span
  m='187610'>back to the unstretched length.</span> </p><p><span m='191300'>So
  knowledge of the potential function,</span> <span m='194210'>also by knowledge
  of its first derivative,</span> <span m='199400'>gives us information about
  the force</span> <span m='201530'>at any point, any state that the system is
  in.</span> </p><p><span m='204829'>So when we talk about potential
  implicitly,</span> <span m='208190'>we also know what the force is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='211220'>And the potential function is enough to tell us</span>
  <span m='213289'>what the force is at any point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='214579'>And let's just check for this simple case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='217550'>This is minus du dx.</span> </p><p><span m='220040'>When you
  differentiate that, you get minus kx,</span> <span m='223760'>and we know
  that's the spring force.</span> </p><p><span m='226079'>So this is why we're
  suddenly shifting our focus</span> <span m='229370'>to our state, our function
  u of x, and it's first derivative.</span> </p>
