  <p><span m='3890'>Let's consider a system in which there</span> <span
  m='6340'>is no non-conservative work and there's</span> <span m='9310'>a
  potential energy associated with forces in the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='13480'>And for an example, let's model some system</span> <span
  m='19420'>by the following function b x-cubed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='25090'>And we know that our definition of force</span> <span m='30250'>is
  that it's minus the change in potential energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34540'>So if we differentiate this, our force is a function of x.</span>
  </p><p><span m='39490'>And because of that minus sign, you always</span> <span
  m='41350'>have to be careful when you take that type of derivative,</span>
  <span m='44110'>we get as far as the force goes, 2ax minus 3b
  x-squared.</span> </p><p><span m='51550'>Now we ask ourselves, where does this
  force vanish?</span> </p><p><span m='56200'>So if we look at the 0 points for
  the force,</span> <span m='60580'>we can see immediately that there is one x
  equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m='64690'>The other one, if we said 2ax equals a
  3b x-squared</span> <span m='69880'>tells us that we have another 0 point at
  2/3 over 2/3 a over b.</span> </p><p><span m='80050'>Now let's also for
  example, just put some numbers in.</span> </p><p><span m='84300'>For some
  simplicity, let's write this as 4 joules per meter</span> <span
  m='89640'>squared for a.</span> </p><p><span m='91652'>Why do we have meter
  squared?</span> </p><p><span m='92860'>Well, the units of potential energy are
  joules,</span> <span m='95410'>and we're multiplying by x-squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='97660'>And so you can see that d also we're</span> <span
  m='100390'>going to write as 2 joules metered to minus 3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='105759'>And if we put those numbers in, we</span> <span m='109330'>can see
  that we'll get 8 over 6.</span> </p><p><span m='113725'>And 8 over 6 is just
  4/3, and that will be in meters</span> <span m='122500'>where the other 0
  point is.</span> </p><p><span m='125560'>So that's nice, but we'd like to do
  some properties of these 0</span> <span m='130150'>points.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131170'>If we had a particle that we started with some energy</span> <span
  m='135430'>at one 0 point, where would it go?</span> </p><p><span
  m='137440'>What would it do at the other point?</span> </p><p><span
  m='139190'>So in order to understand a little bit more</span> <span
  m='141250'>detail about these 0 points, let's</span> <span m='145150'>make a
  plot of our potential energy U of x verse x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='154570'>Now to begin with, we want to ask ourselves</span> <span
  m='157450'>how does this function behave?</span> </p><p><span m='159610'>And
  for big values of x, the x cube piece will dominate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='163780'>And if we're positive x, we dominate with a negative value</span>
  <span m='170350'>for potential energy.</span> </p><p><span m='171370'>So our
  potential energy function goes off into negative infinity</span> <span
  m='176590'>as x goes to infinity.</span> </p><p><span m='178880'>Now on the
  other side of the scale,</span> <span m='182380'>the x-cubed term will
  dominate for negative values of x.</span> </p><p><span m='185740'>But this
  term is negative, and that's negative,</span> <span m='188080'>so up here it
  will go off to infinity</span> <span m='192340'>in the positive
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='194990'>Now, where are the zeroes of the
  potential function?</span> </p><p><span m='198490'>There's obviously one at x
  equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m='203410'>And with these values, it's not 100%
  obvious immediately,</span> <span m='207670'>but 4x squared minus 2b
  x-cubed--</span> <span m='212079'>if you set x equal to 2, 4 times 2 is 8, b 2
  times 2, 4 times</span> <span m='220480'>4 is 16.</span> </p><p><span
  m='222280'>If b is 2 and x is 2, that's 16.</span> </p><p><span m='225840'>So
  we get a cancellation at x equals 2.</span> </p><p><span m='232570'>And so we
  have a point up here.</span> </p><p><span m='236740'>I'm sorry, that's our 0
  point at x equals 2.</span> </p><p><span m='241100'>Now, we said that the
  force at x equals 4/3 had a 0.</span> </p><p><span m='251440'>And so if we
  plot this function, it's</span> <span m='255010'>going to look something like
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='261620'>Now, let's focus on these two
  points</span> <span m='265000'>right here where our force is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='268270'>Remember, that this is minus the slope.</span>
  </p><p><span m='271780'>And so we can see immediately that these two</span>
  <span m='275200'>points have 0 slope and so the force is 0 there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='278970'>Notice, potential energy always depends on a reference
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='282130'>So whether the potential energy is 0 or
  not is not crucial.</span> </p><p><span m='285130'>But the physical fact that
  the force 0 there has physical</span> <span m='288880'>mean.</span>
  </p><p><span m='289720'>So here this is one of our points F of x is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='295030'>Now, what is the property of this point?</span>
  </p><p><span m='297980'>Well, suppose we ask ourselves if the particle were
  just</span> <span m='302890'>displaced slightly from this position</span>
  <span m='306550'>where the force is 0, which way would the force point?</span>
  </p><p><span m='310180'>Well in order to answer a question like that,</span>
  <span m='312100'>we can look at the slopes on either side of the 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='317020'>So over here the slope is negative,</span> <span
  m='323890'>but the force is minus the slope.</span> </p><p><span m='327230'>So
  F of x is positive on this side.</span> </p><p><span m='331220'>And so if a
  particle is displaced a little bit</span> <span m='334060'>from the 0 point,
  it moves off to the right,</span> <span m='337330'>and it will continue to
  feel a force in this direction,</span> <span m='341210'>and so it will move
  away from the 0 point of the force.</span> </p><p><span m='345490'>Now on the
  other side, we do the same type of argument.</span> </p><p><span
  m='349090'>And over here the slope is positive,</span> <span m='354040'>but
  the force is negative.</span> </p><p><span m='356300'>So again, what we see on
  this side,</span> <span m='359140'>the particle will move away from this 0
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='363550'>And so if our particle just started
  there</span> <span m='366250'>and it had a little bit of kinetic
  energy,</span> <span m='368290'>it would move one way or the other away from
  that point.</span> </p><p><span m='372220'>And so we call this an unstable
  equilibrium point.</span> </p><p><span m='379030'>And that's an abbreviation
  for equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='381340'>Now, what about this 0 point
  over here?</span> </p><p><span m='385160'>Well, we already know that if a
  particle is</span> <span m='389320'>on this side of the 0 it feels the force
  this way.</span> </p><p><span m='392260'>But what if our particle were on this
  side?</span> </p><p><span m='396640'>Well, once again, we analyze the
  slope.</span> </p><p><span m='399409'>The slope is negative, force is minus
  the slope,</span> <span m='402980'>so it's positive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='404170'>So everywhere on this side, the particle</span> <span m='408820'>is
  getting a restoring force back to equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span
  m='413360'>And so if we displace this particle just</span> <span m='415630'>on
  either side, if it doesn't have enough energy</span> <span m='419920'>to get
  over this point, then the particle</span> <span m='423310'>will stay around
  this area.</span> </p><p><span m='426640'>And that is why we give this point
  the name</span> <span m='429640'>of stable equilibrium point.</span>
