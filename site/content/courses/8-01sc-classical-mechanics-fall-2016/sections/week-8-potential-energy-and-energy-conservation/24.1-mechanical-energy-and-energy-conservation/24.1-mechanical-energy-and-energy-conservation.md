title: 24.1 Mechanical Energy and Energy Conservation
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3310'>The total mechanical energy, E sub mech</span> <span
  m='9780'>is defined as the sum of the kinetic energy</span> <span
  m='13410'>and the potential energy, so the sum</span> <span m='15720'>of K
  plus U, where U is the potential energy function</span> <span
  m='23830'>associated with the conservative force--</span> <span m='26110'>with
  an appropriate choice of zero point.</span> </p><p><span m='29260'>If there
  are multiple conservative forces acting</span> <span m='31510'>on the system,
  then U will be the sum</span> <span m='33730'>of individual potential energy
  functions</span> <span m='36610'>for each conservative force with an
  appropriate choice of zero</span> <span m='39910'>point for each individual
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='43240'>We've also seen that the change in the
  kinetic energy</span> <span m='50530'>plus the change in the potential
  energy</span> <span m='54190'>is equal to the change in the total mechanical
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='60700'>And that's just basically the derivative
  of the equation</span> <span m='63130'>that I wrote above.</span> </p><p><span
  m='66350'>And this change in the total mechanical energy</span> <span
  m='68980'>will be 0 for conservative forces.</span> </p><p><span m='73180'>In
  addition, we've seen that the change in potential energy</span> <span
  m='77260'>is related to the conservative work done in the system</span> <span
  m='81970'>so that W sub C, the conservative work done,</span> <span
  m='86410'>is equal to the negative of the change in the potential
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='93550'>But we also know that the total work
  done</span> <span m='96490'>includes both conservative and non-conservative
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='102950'>So the total work done is equal to the
  sum of W sub C,</span> <span m='108880'>the conservative work done, plus the
  non-conservative work done,</span> <span m='113920'>and that that total work
  is equal to the change</span> <span m='118479'>in kinetic energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120650'>Now, I can rewrite that equation by rewriting</span>
  <span m='124240'>the conservative work in terms of the potential
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='127540'>So I could write this, now, as the
  non-conservative work</span> <span m='132970'>minus the change in the
  potential energy</span> <span m='138100'>is equal to the change in the kinetic
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='141579'>This is, again, just a restatement of
  the work</span> <span m='143800'>kinetic energy theorem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='146560'>Now, by rearranging this equation,</span> <span m='149810'>this
  means that the non-conservative work is equal</span> <span m='159430'>to delta
  K, the change in kinetic energy,</span> <span m='167120'>plus delta U, the
  change of potential energy.</span> </p><p><span m='172370'>But that's equal to
  the change in the total mechanical energy.</span> </p><p><span m='175230'>So
  the non-conservative work is equal to the change</span> <span m='183230'>in
  the total mechanical energy.</span> </p><p><span m='185900'>This is a
  sufficiently important result</span> <span m='187760'>that I'm going to write
  it by itself in a box.</span> </p><p><span m='190490'>So the non-conservative
  work is equal to the change</span> <span m='199100'>in the total mechanical
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='204780'>So what we've shown here is that the
  result</span> <span m='207980'>of any non-conservative work on the
  system</span> <span m='210620'>is to change the total mechanical energy</span>
  <span m='213470'>of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='215220'>Now, if there
  is no non-conservative work,</span> <span m='217670'>if the forces acting on
  the system are all conservative,</span> <span m='220579'>then the total
  mechanical energy remains unchanged</span> <span m='224170'>now that Emech is
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='225740'>And we say to the total mechanical energy is
  conserved.</span> </p><p><span m='230640'>Now if there is a non-conservative
  force,</span> <span m='233150'>it turns out that in most cases the work
  done</span> <span m='235520'>by non-conservative force is negative,</span>
  <span m='237980'>resulting in a negative change in</span> <span m='240006'>the
  total mechanical energy-- in other words,</span> <span m='241880'>in the
  removal of total mechanical energy</span> <span m='244910'>from the
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='245620'>It's lost from the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='249450'>Now we've been talking here only about mechanical
  energy, which</span> <span m='253070'>we've defined as the sum of kinetic
  energy</span> <span m='255770'>and potential energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='256980'>But one can also talk about non mechanical energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='261589'>The most common example of which is loosely referred
  to as heat.</span> </p><p><span m='265760'>As an example, in the case of
  friction,</span> <span m='268080'>which is a non-conservative force,</span>
  <span m='269870'>we know that the action of friction generates heat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='273830'>What's happening is that the non-conservative work
  done</span> <span m='276800'>by friction is negative and, therefore, is
  reducing</span> <span m='280909'>the mechanical energy, the total mechanical
  energy,</span> <span m='283760'>according to this expression, but where does
  that energy go?</span> </p><p><span m='288650'>We said that it's removed from
  the system-- in terms</span> <span m='290870'>of mechanical energy, that's
  true.</span> </p><p><span m='292520'>But we can think of it as, at the same
  time,</span> <span m='295340'>causing an increase in the non mechanical
  energy, or the heat</span> <span m='299750'>energy, of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='301710'>So if one were to keep track of both mechanical
  and</span> <span m='305150'>non-mechanical energy, then it turns out</span>
  <span m='307760'>that the total energy, mechanical and non-mechanical,</span>
  <span m='310910'>the total energy of a system is conserved,</span> <span
  m='314180'>even if non-conservative forces are acting.</span> </p><p><span
  m='318150'>However, it's difficult to recover</span> <span m='320450'>the
  non-mechanical energy and change it back</span> <span m='322670'>into
  mechanical energy.</span> </p><p><span m='323870'>These non-conservative
  processes are not reversible.</span> </p><p><span m='328710'>This is a
  complicated topic, and it's</span> <span m='330680'>the province of more
  advanced courses in thermodynamics</span> <span m='333950'>or statistical
  mechanics, which you may encounter later.</span> </p><p><span m='337580'>In
  this course, we will confine our attention</span> <span m='340159'>to
  mechanical energy, the sum of kinetic energy</span> <span m='343430'>and
  potential energy, and will treat non-conservative force</span> <span
  m='347090'>as removing, or adding, mechanical energy</span> <span
  m='349970'>to the system.</span> </p><p></p>
