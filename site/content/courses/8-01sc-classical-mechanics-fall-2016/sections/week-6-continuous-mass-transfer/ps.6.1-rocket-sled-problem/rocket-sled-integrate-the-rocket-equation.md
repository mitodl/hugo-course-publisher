  <p><span m='3940'>We just arrived this relation here-- the relation</span>
  <span m='8189'>between the differential of the speed of the rocket sled</span>
  <span m='11340'>and the differential of the mass of the rocket.</span>
  </p><p><span m='14410'>And we want to ultimately get the speed of the
  rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='17830'>So we have to apply a technique called
  separation of variables</span> <span m='22950'>and then we want to
  integrate.</span> </p><p><span m='25464'>What we're going to do is, first
  we're</span> <span m='27110'>going to divide-- multiply by dt so that falls
  away,</span> <span m='33300'>and we are left with m r d v r equals d m r
  u.</span> </p><p><span m='42610'>And we're going to shuffle the m onto the
  other side.</span> </p><p><span m='47100'>And we're left with d v r
  equals--</span> <span m='49310'>u is a constant-- so that goes up
  front,</span> <span m='53220'>and then we have d m r over m r.</span>
  </p><p><span m='58510'>That's an equation that we can integrate now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='61716'>And we can do that.</span> </p><p><span m='65830'>And
  the tricky bit is that we need</span> <span m='68320'>to take care of the
  integration limits here.</span> </p><p><span m='70930'>We have v r, and
  actually these now are all primes.</span> </p><p><span m='76390'>So we have v
  r going from v0.</span> </p><p><span m='80695'>That is our initial condition
  here 2vr</span> <span m='84132'>prime of equal vr of t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='94070'>And for the mass, we have m r prime equals m0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='99270'>Actually, not quite m0, it's 2m0 because the initial mass</span>
  <span m='105515'>of this is the dry mass and the fuel mass,</span> <span
  m='108650'>so that's 2m0, so this is the initial mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='116400'>And then we go to m r prime equals m of vr.</span> </p><p><span
  m='124930'>All right, so let's do that.</span> </p><p><span m='127400'>We're
  going to get vr minus v0 equals u 1 over m,</span> <span m='136930'>integrated
  gives us lm, so lm.</span> </p><p><span m='141014'>And then we can immediately
  do this here over 2m0.</span> </p><p><span m='152750'>And well, we ultimately
  want this,</span> <span m='156810'>so this is the r of t, of course.</span>
  </p><p><span m='158980'>And then we got v0 plus u l n m r over 2 m0</span>
  <span m='171610'>And that is our equation.</span> </p><p><span m='176850'>So
  what does this equation tell us?</span> </p><p><span m='179530'>M r, the mass
  of the rocket is less later</span> <span m='185190'>on than it was before,
  which means this term here</span> <span m='190600'>is going to be less than 0,
  which</span> <span m='194680'>means the velocity is our initial
  velocity</span> <span m='198130'>minus something.</span> </p><p><span
  m='200900'>Which means we have a decrease in velocity,</span> <span
  m='205480'>which means my sled will eventually come to a stop.</span> </p>
