  <p><span m='3800'>Let's look at this rocket sled here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6100'>It's gone on in the snow, but it wants to stop.</span> </p><p><span
  m='10310'>There are two little devices mounted on the sled,</span> <span
  m='12890'>and they can eject gas.</span> </p><p><span m='14730'>And so the
  forward one is used to eject gas</span> <span m='18380'>to make the sled
  stop.</span> </p><p><span m='21410'>We want to derive a relation for the
  differential</span> <span m='25340'>between the speed of the sled and the
  differential</span> <span m='29630'>of the mass of the rocket sled.</span>
  </p><p><span m='33050'>But before we do that with a rocket equation,</span>
  <span m='35096'>we need to actually consider what</span> <span m='36470'>else
  we know about this system.</span> </p><p><span m='39240'>Well, we know that
  the dry mass has a mass of m0.</span> </p><p><span m='44330'>The fuel mass is
  given also as m0.</span> </p><p><span m='48680'>And we know that, at time of t
  equals 0, the speed of the sled</span> <span m='53690'>is v0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='56270'>We also know that, at a later time, t plus delta
  t,</span> <span m='60200'>we have the sled here whose mass is now m of t plus
  delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='65870'>And we have this low mass parcel that
  has been ejected,</span> <span m='70070'>so the gas.</span> </p><p><span
  m='71620'>And that has the mass of delta mf, so the mass of the fuel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78690'>We furthermore know that, relative to the sled,</span>
  <span m='82130'>this little gas parcel is moving with a speed u.</span>
  </p><p><span m='88630'>The rocket equation says that my force-- my external
  force--</span> <span m='93910'>has two terms.</span> </p><p><span m='95530'>We
  have the mass of the rocket times the acceleration</span> <span m='99220'>of
  the sled minus the differential here</span> <span m='106930'>of the mass times
  the speed u.</span> </p><p><span m='111870'>And these are actually all
  vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='114330'>And so this describes this little gas
  parcel here,</span> <span m='119400'>and this one describes rocket and
  we</span> <span m='122920'>know that v equals v i hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='127350'>i hat is going in the right-- in the direction of motion,</span>
  <span m='131080'>and u equals u i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='134950'>We also
  know that no external forces apply to the sled,</span> <span m='139720'>so
  that's actually 0.</span> </p><p><span m='143110'>We can then turn this
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m='146490'>We can apply all of this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='148030'>We will get 0 equals mr dvr/dt minus dmr/dtu.</span>
  </p><p><span m='161230'>We can bring this one on the other side,</span> <span
  m='164350'>and we end up with the relationship that we wanted</span> <span
  m='170110'>to obtain-- namely, an equation that</span> <span
  m='175570'>contains the differentials of the speed of the rocket,</span> <span
  m='181985'>that sled, and the differential of the mass.</span> </p>
