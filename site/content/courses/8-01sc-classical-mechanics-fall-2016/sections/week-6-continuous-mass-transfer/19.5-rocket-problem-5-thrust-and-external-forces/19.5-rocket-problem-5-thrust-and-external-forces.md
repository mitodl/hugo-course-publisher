title: 19.5 Rocket Problem 5 - Thrust and External Forces
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3630'>For a rocket and an external force,</span> <span m='6720'>we
  had the rocket equation, which</span> <span m='8670'>we wrote as mass of the
  rocket-- now remember,</span> <span m='11680'>this is a function of time--
  times the derivative</span> <span m='15540'>of the rocket dr dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18570'>And we also had this second term that</span> <span
  m='21030'>came from the ejecting fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='23700'>Now from
  our mass conservation equation,</span> <span m='26370'>we can rewrite this
  equation as a differential relationship</span> <span m='29820'>that the change
  of mass of the fuel in time</span> <span m='33180'>is equal to minus the
  change of the rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='36410'>It doesn't matter which
  side we put the minus sign on.</span> </p><p><span m='40500'>So now I want to
  interpret this equation in a different way,</span> <span m='44280'>and it will
  come back to what we mean by our system.</span> </p><p><span m='47710'>Let's
  first off bring this other term over to this side.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52470'>So we have plus dMr dt u.</span> </p><p><span m='58650'>And that's
  equal to Mr dVr dt.</span> </p><p><span m='63820'>Now separately, let's make
  this substitution again and go back</span> <span m='67380'>to our fuel
  term.</span> </p><p><span m='69420'>So that's minus dMf dt u equals Mr dVr
  dt.</span> </p><p><span m='78700'>Now notice that over here we have mass
  times</span> <span m='82090'>the acceleration of the rocket.</span>
  </p><p><span m='83820'>So if we just rethought our system as simply the
  rocket--</span> <span m='90310'>Mr-- then we have two forces acting on the
  rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='96180'>The external force might be the
  gravitational field,</span> <span m='98970'>but we have a new term here which
  we're</span> <span m='101789'>going to refer to as thrust.</span> </p><p><span
  m='107130'>And so our thrust can be thought of as an external force</span>
  <span m='115289'>simply on the rocket as a system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='120390'>And that's equal to minus the f dt u.</span> </p><p><span
  m='126090'>Now again, if I chose j-hat up-- let's</span> <span m='130139'>just
  look at this in components--</span> <span m='133500'>then our thrust as a
  vector, we'll</span> <span m='138000'>write it as a y-component, is equal to
  minus dMfuel dt.</span> </p><p><span m='145980'>Now what is that relative
  speed?</span> </p><p><span m='148140'>Well, the fuel is being ejected
  backwards,</span> <span m='150960'>so that's minus mu j-hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='154230'>The external force, by the way, would be minus mg
  j-hat</span> <span m='158430'>if it's near the surface of the Earth.</span>
  </p><p><span m='160380'>So we have another minus u j-hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='164070'>And we see that we have a positive thrust</span> <span
  m='168340'>force in the vertical direction that</span> <span m='172560'>is
  giving us an additional force other than the gravitational</span> <span
  m='177060'>field.</span> </p><p><span m='177840'>And in Cartesian-- in our
  unit vectors here,</span> <span m='181080'>we have minus mg plus dMfuel dt
  times u is equal to Mr dV</span> <span m='193830'>ydt of the rocket.</span>
  </p><p><span m='197790'>And so this is the rocket equation in
  components.</span> </p><p></p>
