transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3382'>Now that we have all the pieces in place,</span> <span
  m='5090'>we'd like to apply the momentum principle to the rocket</span> <span
  m='7460'>problem.</span> </p><p><span m='8310'>Recall that the momentum
  principle</span> <span m='10490'>is that the external force on the
  rocket</span> <span m='14360'>causes-- on the system-- causes the momentum of
  the system</span> <span m='17510'>to change.</span> </p><p><span m='18690'>And
  the fundamental definition of a derivative</span> <span m='22460'>is to look
  at the change in momentum between sometimes t</span> <span m='26720'>plus
  delta t-- our two states that we've identified--</span> <span
  m='32030'>divided by delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='35210'>Now recall that we
  had the momentum of the system</span> <span m='40390'>at time t was the mass
  of the rocket times</span> <span m='44270'>d-bar of the rocket a t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='46730'>I'll just quickly show mass of the rocket V-rt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='54530'>And we had the system at time t plus delta t</span>
  <span m='62750'>where we had delta M-fuel equals minus delta M-rocket Here
  we</span> <span m='68660'>had M-r plus delta M. And we had the velocity in the
  ground</span> <span m='75680'>frame, which we saw was equal to-- so
  let's</span> <span m='81350'>write out the momentum of the system at time t
  plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='86150'>That was a little bit
  longer.</span> </p><p><span m='88420'>p system at t plus delta t had two
  pieces.</span> </p><p><span m='94070'>It had M-r plus delta M-r times V of r
  of t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='102050'>And we were subtracting--
  now, because we</span> <span m='106670'>made this change, that's minus then
  delta M-r u</span> <span m='111270'>plus V-bar of t plus delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='115580'>And this, recall, was the velocity of the fuel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120590'>Now we're in position to apply our momentum
  principle,</span> <span m='124880'>because we have expressions for the
  momentum</span> <span m='126950'>of the system at time t and at time t</span>
  <span m='131150'>and at time t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='133160'>So
  now this will be a big expression.</span> </p><p><span m='135980'>So we'll
  write external force is the limit as delta t goes to 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143120'>Now here, our first term, is of M of r plus delta M-r times</span>
  <span m='150230'>the velocity of the rocket at time t plus delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155960'>And now we have the fuel term, minus delta M-r times
  u</span> <span m='162440'>plus V of r of t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='168020'>And we have to subtract from that</span> <span m='169400'>and I'll
  indicate that with a slightly different color.</span> </p><p><span
  m='173480'>M-r V of r of t.</span> </p><p><span m='177590'>And the whole
  thing, we're dividing by delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='183860'>Now let's
  look at this expression</span> <span m='185810'>first because there is some
  very nice simplifications.</span> </p><p><span m='188510'>The first thing we
  can see, let's look at this term delta</span> <span m='191260'>M-r times V of
  r.</span> </p><p><span m='193010'>Notice we have minus delta M-r V of r
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='197520'>So those two terms cancel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='199790'>And we're just left with three other terms</span>
  <span m='202430'>and let's write them out.</span> </p><p><span m='204360'>So
  now we have the limit as delta t goes to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='209210'>And
  I'm going to combine terms in the following way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211920'>M-r times V of r of t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='218750'>And over here, I have M-r minus V of r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='221630'>So I have a minus V of r of t divided by delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='230090'>And now I have one more term here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='232520'>And I'm going to write this as minus the limit as delta t
  goes</span> <span m='238160'>to 0 of delta M-r over delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='242120'>Remember, this term cancelled.</span> </p><p><span
  m='243440'>We only have u, the speed of the fuel relative to the
  rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='249890'>And in both cases-- this is our first
  term</span> <span m='254030'>and here's our second term.</span> </p><p><span
  m='255450'>Let's look at these limits.</span> </p><p><span m='257260'>Notice
  in here, we're just taking</span> <span m='258950'>V of r of t plus delta t
  minus V of r-t divided by delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='263930'>And that's
  precisely the definition of the derivative</span> <span m='267650'>of the
  velocity of the rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='269540'>So this first term, our
  expression</span> <span m='272030'>becomes the external force is equal to the
  mass</span> <span m='276620'>of our system times V of r, the derivative</span>
  <span m='280820'>of the velocity of the rocket.</span> </p><p><span
  m='283100'>And the second term, this is the rate</span> <span m='285800'>that
  the fuel is changing in the rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='289180'>This is
  rather the rate that the mass of the rocket is changing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='293010'>So that's the derivative dM-r dt times the relative velocity</span>
  <span m='300350'>of the fuel with respect to the rocket.</span> </p><p><span
  m='302540'>So this equation here-- I'll box it off--</span> <span
  m='308710'>is called the rocket equation, which</span> <span m='314810'>we've
  derived from the momentum principle</span> <span m='317100'>using our momentum
  diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='319580'>And you can see that this is what
  people refer to</span> <span m='323030'>as rocket science.</span> </p>
