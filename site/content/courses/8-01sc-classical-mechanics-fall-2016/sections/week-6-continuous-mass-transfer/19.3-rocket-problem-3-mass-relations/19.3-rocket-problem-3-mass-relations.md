transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3570'>So now, we wrote down the momentum</span> <span m='5620'>of
  the system of our rocket at time, t,</span> <span m='7844'>and the movement of
  the system of the rocket at time</span> <span m='10010'>t plus delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='11310'>Let's make some simplifications in our notation</span>
  <span m='13720'>just to make our calculations a little more easy to
  read.</span> </p><p><span m='17840'>So the first thing we want to do is</span>
  <span m='19570'>we want to say that the mass of the rocket at time,</span>
  <span m='22680'>t-- this is the mass of the rocket</span> <span m='24790'>plus
  the mass of the fuel in the rocket at time, t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='27340'>We're just going to denote that by mr.</span> </p><p><span
  m='30980'>And keep in mind that, when you write the mass at time</span> <span
  m='36820'>t plus delta t, we'll write that as the mass at time</span> <span
  m='42150'>t plus delta mr. This is precisely how you</span> <span
  m='46760'>define a differential.</span> </p><p><span m='48290'>Even if this
  quantity is negative,</span> <span m='50940'>you always write the
  difference.</span> </p><p><span m='54000'>m of r of t plus delta t minus m of
  rt equal to delta</span> <span m='58620'>mr. That's how we write a
  differential delta</span> <span m='62100'>mass of the rocket.</span>
  </p><p><span m='63600'>So the mass of the rocket at time, t,</span> <span
  m='66050'>looks simpler-- m of r plus delta mr.</span> </p><p><span
  m='71460'>So those are two ways of simplifying our expressions</span> <span
  m='74910'>for the terms that are appearing here and there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='78610'>Now, the next thing was, recall from our mass conservation,</span>
  <span m='82250'>that we had the condition that delta m fuel was</span> <span
  m='85520'>equal to minus delta m rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='89270'>So now,
  we'll take those two simplifications,</span> <span m='92680'>and now we'll
  write down our system momentum at time, t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='98610'>That's very simple.</span> </p><p><span m='99720'>mr v of r at time
  t, and we'll now write the momentum</span> <span m='108120'>at time t plus
  delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='112009'>Well, we have the first piece,
  which</span> <span m='114460'>is mr plus delta mr times the velocity of the
  rocket</span> <span m='123130'>at time t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='125840'>Now, be careful here because we're</span> <span m='127690'>going to
  use our conservation of mass condition</span> <span m='132270'>to replace
  delta m fuel with minus delta m rocket,</span> <span m='136190'>and we'll use
  our expression for the velocity of fuel</span> <span m='139974'>in the ground
  frame of the rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='141390'>So we have minus delta m
  rocket times the velocity u</span> <span m='147480'>plus v of r of t plus
  delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='152480'>And this simplification, we'll write
  equations 1 and equation</span> <span m='157160'>2, will enable us to apply
  the momentum principle</span> <span m='162240'>in a very transparent
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='164010'>And that's what we'll do next.</span> </p>
