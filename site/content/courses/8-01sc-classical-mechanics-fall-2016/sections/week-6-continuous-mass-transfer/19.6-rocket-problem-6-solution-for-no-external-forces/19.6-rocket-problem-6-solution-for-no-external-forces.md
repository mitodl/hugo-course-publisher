title: 19.6 Rocket Problem 6 - Solution for No External Forces
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3500'>We would now like to look at some applications of the
  rocket</span> <span m='6000'>equation, in which we have an external force plus
  dmr dt,</span> <span m='13690'>where m and r is the mass of the rocket at time
  t times</span> <span m='17090'>the relative velocity of the exhaust
  velocity</span> <span m='19360'>was equal to m of r dv rocket, dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='24450'>And now we want to consider some special cases.</span>
  </p><p><span m='27420'>So our first example will be a case when</span> <span
  m='31280'>there is no external force.</span> </p><p><span m='33480'>Now, this
  might be characteristic of a rocket that</span> <span m='35820'>is far away
  from any type of gravitational interaction</span> <span m='39660'>and is
  either speeding up or slowing down.</span> </p><p><span m='41910'>This is a
  special case that will enable</span> <span m='43970'>us to understand our
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='45680'>Now, we'll draw a picture at time
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='50860'>Just to remind ourselves, we have mass of the
  rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='55020'>It's moving with a velocity v of r of
  t,</span> <span m='58200'>and we're going to call this our plus i hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='62190'>And then at time t plus delta t,
  we</span> <span m='67780'>have our fuel delta, delta m fuel,</span> <span
  m='72150'>which was equal to minus delta m rocket moving</span> <span
  m='75150'>with the relative velocity u plus v of r of t plus delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='80500'>And our rocket itself is moving with v of r of t plus
  delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='91170'>So in our coordinate system, we
  have</span> <span m='94479'>to remember that the exhaust speed is</span> <span
  m='99140'>relative to the rocket, and we define that to be u.</span>
  </p><p><span m='103932'>Since the rocket is moving forward</span> <span
  m='106680'>and we've chosen plus i hat in that direction,</span> <span
  m='108930'>it's minus u i hat, and we can write our vectors vr</span> <span
  m='114580'>as v of r i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='119920'>So our rocket
  equation in this special case</span> <span m='123510'>becomes dmr dt, minus u
  i hat, equals mr dvr dt i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='137210'>Now, in this
  equation, remember that it's</span> <span m='140850'>important to recall that
  m of r is a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='146700'>Unless we have an
  explicit model for how the mass is ejected,</span> <span m='151180'>in
  principle we can't solve for the time behavior,</span> <span m='154370'>but we
  can look at this differential equation</span> <span m='158040'>just by
  eliminating the time completely by multiplying</span> <span m='161870'>through
  by dt, in which case we have minus dmr u</span> <span m='167970'>equals m of r
  dvr.</span> </p><p><span m='171320'>Now, this is separable and I can integrate
  it,</span> <span m='174780'>so I'll bring the terms minus dmr over mr on this
  side,</span> <span m='180380'>times u, and that's equal to dvr on that
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='185590'>Now, when we integrate, we're
  going</span> <span m='187620'>to be integrating mass of the rocket,</span>
  <span m='189860'>say at some initial time, t initial,</span> <span
  m='193560'>to mass of the rocket at some final time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='197497'>And over here, we're going to be integrating</span> <span
  m='199329'>the velocity from some initial time to some final time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='204800'>When both these integrals are straightforward,</span>
  <span m='207430'>on the left-hand side we have a natural log,</span> <span
  m='210260'>so we have minus u, natural log of mrt final over mrt
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='220750'>And this side, we just have the
  velocity difference,</span> <span m='223840'>v of r at t final minus vr at t
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='229690'>Now, again, we always check our minus
  signs,</span> <span m='233050'>but recall the mass of the rocket is
  decreasing.</span> </p><p><span m='236230'>So the log of a fraction is
  negative,</span> <span m='238390'>so we have a positive quantity on this
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='240930'>And that's indicating that the velocity
  has increased</span> <span m='243480'>on that side, and so we conclude that
  the velocity of the rocket</span> <span m='249880'>at its final time is equal
  to the velocity of the rocket</span> <span m='254200'>at its initial
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='256630'>Now, here, I'll keep this minus
  sign</span> <span m='259600'>in here-- minus natural log of mrt final over mrt
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='269380'>Now, in our answer, we need to
  know</span> <span m='272460'>what the mass of the rocket is at the final
  time,</span> <span m='275920'>so in general this equation is still not</span>
  <span m='278770'>going to give us an explicit expression for v</span> <span
  m='280810'>of t final, unless we have one special case</span> <span
  m='284210'>in which our final time is when all the fuel has been
  burned.</span> </p><p><span m='288890'>And our initial time is the rocket with
  all the fuel there,</span> <span m='292130'>and then this ratio is a known
  ratio.</span> </p><p><span m='294840'>And you can look at a variety of
  different examples for that.</span> </p><p><span m='298120'>So there is an
  example of the solving</span> <span m='301330'>the motion of a rocket with no
  external forces.</span> </p><p></p>
