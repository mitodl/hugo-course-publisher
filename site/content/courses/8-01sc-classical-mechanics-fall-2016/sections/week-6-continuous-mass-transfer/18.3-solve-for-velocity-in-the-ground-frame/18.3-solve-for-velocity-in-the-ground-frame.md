title: 18.3 Solve for Velocity in the Ground Frame
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3580'>So we've now drawn pictures of the interaction</span> <span
  m='6070'>of a person jumping off a cart in both the ground</span> <span
  m='8590'>frame and a reference frame moving with velocity, vc, which</span>
  <span m='12940'>is the final speed of the cart.</span> </p><p><span
  m='14650'>These were pictures in the reference frame moving with vc,</span>
  <span m='17500'>and these are the pictures-- momentum</span> <span
  m='19360'>diagrams-- of the person and the cart in the ground frame.</span>
  </p><p><span m='23830'>Now, we would like to apply the momentum
  principle</span> <span m='26140'>to solve for vp and vc.</span> </p><p><span
  m='29200'>We are given that the velocity of the person in the moving</span>
  <span m='33280'>frame, u.</span> </p><p><span m='35470'>We'll treat this as a
  given quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='39160'>And we'll express the velocity,
  vc,</span> <span m='42130'>and so we want to find vc and vp in terms of u and
  p and mc.</span> </p><p><span m='56530'>Now, we'll use the ground frame
  first,</span> <span m='60670'>and our assumption here is that the person
  jumped horizontally</span> <span m='64949'>and that there are no external
  forces</span> <span m='66490'>in the horizontal direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='67656'>So all of the vectors we've drawn are horizontal,</span> <span
  m='70600'>and there's no external forces in the horizontal direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='73550'>Then we know that the initial momentum of the
  system</span> <span m='79090'>is equal to the final momentum of the
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='82450'>In our initial picture, nothing is
  moving.</span> </p><p><span m='85420'>And in our final picture, we have</span>
  <span m='87340'>m cart v cart plus m person v person is 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='93740'>Now, recall that we also showed that the velocity of the
  person</span> <span m='98140'>in the ground frame is related to the velocity
  of the person</span> <span m='103150'>in the moving frame by adding the
  relative velocity</span> <span m='107229'>of the two frames.</span>
  </p><p><span m='109450'>The relative velocity of the two frames</span> <span
  m='112000'>is the velocity of the cart, vc, so what we have is vc plus
  u.</span> </p><p><span m='119350'>So this is how vp is related to u.</span>
  </p><p><span m='123130'>And now, I can use this start equation</span> <span
  m='125350'>to write it as 0 equals mc vc plus mp times vc plus u.</span>
  </p><p><span m='133630'>And by adding terms, I get that mc plus mp vc equals
  minus mpu.</span> </p><p><span m='145270'>Or the velocity of the cart is equal
  to minus mpu divided</span> <span m='151660'>by mc plus mp.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155620'>Now that I have the velocity of the cart,</span> <span
  m='158150'>I can just substitute that in here</span> <span m='160230'>to find
  the velocity of the person, which, remember,</span> <span m='163720'>was the
  velocity of the cart plus u.</span> </p><p><span m='166930'>So now, I've
  solved this problem in the ground frame.</span> </p><p><span m='170710'>Next,
  I'll do the same analysis in the moving frame.</span> </p><p></p>
