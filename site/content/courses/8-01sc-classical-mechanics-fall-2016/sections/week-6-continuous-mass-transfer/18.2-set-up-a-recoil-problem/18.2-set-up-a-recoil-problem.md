  <p><span m='3510'>We would like to now apply the momentum principle</span>
  <span m='9660'>to examples of recoil.</span> </p><p><span m='12750'>So recall
  that the momentum principle</span> <span m='16750'>is that the external force
  causes the momentum</span> <span m='20670'>of the system to change.</span>
  </p><p><span m='23860'>Now, this is a vector equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='25680'>So for example, if the external force in the x direction</span>
  <span m='29250'>is 0, then the momentum of the system in the x
  direction,</span> <span m='34010'>let's say, the final momentum will be</span>
  <span m='36310'>equal to the initial momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='40780'>I
  would like to now apply the momentum principle</span> <span m='43310'>to an
  example of recoil.</span> </p><p><span m='46780'>In our recoil example, we
  have a person jumping off a cart.</span> </p><p><span m='50430'>So let's just
  look at how this example can work</span> <span m='57490'>if we draw momentum
  diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='59950'>So suppose we choose a ground
  frame.</span> </p><p><span m='64720'>And in that ground frame, we have a cart
  and a person.</span> </p><p><span m='69530'>A person is standing on the
  cart.</span> </p><p><span m='71490'>And this is t initial.</span> </p><p><span
  m='74380'>And here, they are at rest.</span> </p><p><span m='78670'>Now, the
  person we're going to assume to jump horizontally</span> <span m='81860'>off
  the cart, and the cart will recoil</span> <span m='84330'>in the opposite
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='86000'>So after the jump, we can describe
  this picture.</span> </p><p><span m='90600'>The person is moving with the
  velocity,</span> <span m='93000'>v. The cart is moving with vc.</span>
  </p><p><span m='95051'>And the person has jumped with the velocity vp.</span>
  </p><p><span m='101009'>Now, suppose I choose a different reference
  frame.</span> </p><p><span m='106200'>That instead of choosing a ground</span>
  <span m='107860'>frame, as a reference frame moving with the velocity
  vc.</span> </p><p><span m='120700'>You can imagine that maybe I have a car
  here</span> <span m='125900'>and you're inside that car moving with velocity
  vc,</span> <span m='129690'>and you're looking at this picture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='132460'>Then, what would our momentum diagrams look
  like?</span> </p><p><span m='135520'>Well, if I'm moving in a car this
  way</span> <span m='137870'>and in the ground frame the initial picture</span>
  <span m='141390'>is the person in the cart is at rest.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143820'>Then, in my moving frame, it actually</span> <span m='145740'>looks
  as if the cart and the person</span> <span m='148370'>are moving in the
  opposite direction.</span> </p><p><span m='150870'>So let's write that this
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='153950'>Here's the initial picture, t
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='157970'>And in this frame, the person and the
  cart</span> <span m='161250'>are moving with vc minus vc.</span> </p><p><span
  m='164980'>I put an arrow here to indicate that it's</span> <span
  m='167450'>opposite the direction of vc there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='170320'>But their velocity is minus the velocity</span> <span m='174079'>of
  the reference frame.</span> </p><p><span m='175630'>After the jump-- so here's
  the person now.</span> </p><p><span m='180790'>The cart is at rest,
  why?</span> </p><p><span m='184160'>Because we're in the reference frame
  moving with vc.</span> </p><p><span m='187700'>So if you're in a car and
  you're moving at the same speed</span> <span m='190500'>that the cart has with
  the ground frame,</span> <span m='192960'>then in your frame, this cart looks
  like it's at rest.</span> </p><p><span m='197840'>What about the person
  jumping off?</span> </p><p><span m='199930'>Well, let's write it this
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='202970'>So this is the velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='204050'>I'm going to use a symbol, u.</span> </p><p><span
  m='206630'>Now, u-- this is what do we mean by that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='210260'>This is the velocity of the person in the moving</span> <span
  m='218950'>frame that's moving with velocity vc-- that's</span> <span
  m='227240'>the velocity of the person as seen by a car.</span> </p><p><span
  m='229770'>Sometimes we call this the velocity of the person</span> <span
  m='236640'>relative to the cart.</span> </p><p><span m='243030'>What does that
  word relative to the cart mean?</span> </p><p><span m='246550'>Well, you can
  see in this picture.</span> </p><p><span m='249020'>In this moving frame, the
  cart is at rest,</span> <span m='251060'>and the person jumps with the speed u
  velocity</span> <span m='253890'>u relative to the cart.</span> </p><p><span
  m='256760'>So these are momentum diagrams for a ground frame</span> <span
  m='260654'>in which the person in the cart started</span> <span m='262280'>at
  rest, the person jumps off.</span> </p><p><span m='264800'>I can put an arrow
  here, but it's really</span> <span m='267060'>information is in that
  vector.</span> </p><p><span m='268790'>The cart is moving.</span> </p><p><span
  m='270550'>In a frame moving with the velocity of the cart,</span> <span
  m='273790'>then what does my picture looks like?</span> </p><p><span
  m='277780'>Well, the cart and the person initially</span> <span m='279550'>are
  moving opposite directions.</span> </p><p><span m='282960'>Again, you're
  moving this way.</span> </p><p><span m='284274'>The cart looks like it's
  moving that way</span> <span m='285940'>if you're inside the car.</span>
  </p><p><span m='287900'>And the final state, person, cart is at rest</span>
  <span m='292110'>and the person is jumping with the velocity u</span> <span
  m='295590'>relative to the cart.</span> </p><p><span m='297540'>Now, our
  question now is how do we relate</span> <span m='301140'>these two velocities,
  u and vp?</span> </p><p><span m='305460'>What are u and vp?</span>
  </p><p><span m='307260'>vp is the velocity of the person in the ground
  frame.</span> </p><p><span m='310310'>And u is the velocity of the person in
  the moving frame.</span> </p><p><span m='314140'>Well, we've already seen our
  equation</span> <span m='316410'>for how to get velocities in different
  frames.</span> </p><p><span m='318970'>We have that vp equals the relative
  velocity of the two</span> <span m='323530'>frames plus the velocity in the
  moving frame.</span> </p><p><span m='327140'>So what we have is, this is the
  velocity of the person--</span> <span m='333570'>let me just clean that up--
  of the person in the ground frame.</span> </p><p><span m='345130'>v is the
  relative velocity of the two frames.</span> </p><p><span m='348490'>So here we
  have that v is the velocity of the cart,</span> <span m='352130'>because
  you're in a frame moving with vc with respect</span> <span m='355290'>to the
  ground.</span> </p><p><span m='356530'>And u is the velocity of the person in
  the moving frame.</span> </p><p><span m='371590'>So this is how we can show
  the same type of interaction</span> <span m='376440'>in two different
  reference frames.</span> </p><p><span m='378980'>Next, we'll figure out what
  these velocities are.</span> </p><p></p>
