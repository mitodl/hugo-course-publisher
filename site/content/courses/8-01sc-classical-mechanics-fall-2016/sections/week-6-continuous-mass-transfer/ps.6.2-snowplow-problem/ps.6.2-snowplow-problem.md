  <p><span m='3520'>Let's consider another example of continuous mass
  transfer.</span> </p><p><span m='6710'>Suppose we have a truck, and that
  truck</span> <span m='9960'>has some type of plow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12610'>And it's plowing snow.</span> </p><p><span m='15620'>And there's
  some type of external force acting</span> <span m='18570'>on this truck,
  friction, pushing the truck forward,</span> <span m='21970'>so let's just
  assume we have some type of force, F,</span> <span m='25650'>on the
  truck.</span> </p><p><span m='26860'>And this is our snow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='29550'>And what's happening in this problem</span> <span m='31320'>is that
  the truck connects-- picks up the snow.</span> </p><p><span m='37550'>And
  then, which is at rest initially,</span> <span m='40420'>gets the snow up to
  the speed of the truck.</span> </p><p><span m='42990'>And then the snow falls
  off the plow.</span> </p><p><span m='45690'>So how do we model this
  problem?</span> </p><p><span m='47730'>Well, let's look at our situation at
  time t.</span> </p><p><span m='50430'>And what we're going to do is,
  we're</span> <span m='51930'>going to consider a certain mass of snow, delta
  ms, that's</span> <span m='56350'>at rest.</span> </p><p><span m='58070'>And
  our truck, it's a fixed mass truck,</span> <span m='61580'>is moving with a
  velocity vt at time t, the truck.</span> </p><p><span m='70280'>So now, what
  happens at time t plus delta t?</span> </p><p><span m='75840'>Well, the truck
  has picked up the mass of the snow.</span> </p><p><span m='82020'>And the
  truck has now changed its speed.</span> </p><p><span m='84730'>So that's at
  time t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='89360'>And now we want to write
  down our momentum law.</span> </p><p><span m='93850'>So we have our external
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='96990'>Let's call this the plus i hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='100250'>We have our external force is equal
  to the limit</span> <span m='105280'>as delta t goes to 0 of the momentum at
  time t.</span> </p><p><span m='110039'>So we have t plus delta t, so
  what</span> <span m='112250'>we have is the mass of the truck plus delta ms
  times</span> <span m='118890'>v of t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='123620'>And we have to subtract from it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='125150'>That's divided by delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='127230'>And we
  have to subtract from this the moment at time t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131410'>The snow is at rest, only the truck</span> <span m='133180'>is
  moving, so we have minus t of vt divided by delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='141820'>Now, as usual, we're going to say that the truck has changed</span>
  <span m='146520'>its velocity in this interval.</span> </p><p><span
  m='151100'>And what we want to do now is write out our equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='154340'>We have F equals the limit as delta t goes to
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='160980'>Now when we write this out, notice</span>
  <span m='163760'>that we're going to have a number of terms here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='165980'>We have mt plus delta ms times v plus delta v</span>
  <span m='173329'>of the truce-- that's the first term-- divided by delta
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='179329'>And the second term is just minus mass of
  the truck,</span> <span m='182870'>vt over delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='186220'>Well, first off, we see some cancellations</span> <span
  m='188560'>between this term, this, and that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='191880'>And what we're left with is limit as delta t goes to 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='196550'>We have the snow term, delta ms over delta t times the
  truck.</span> </p><p><span m='202010'>Now, here we have a term, which
  we're</span> <span m='203900'>going to analyze in a moment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='205560'>It has two infinitesimal quantities.</span>
  </p><p><span m='208540'>And this term is of second order,</span> <span
  m='211090'>which we're going to neglect.</span> </p><p><span m='213680'>And
  finally, we have the term of mass</span> <span m='216945'>of the truck times
  delta vt delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='223480'>So, neglecting this
  second-order term</span> <span m='226980'>in differentials, what we get
  when</span> <span m='228890'>we take the limit is, that we get the force is
  the rate</span> <span m='233430'>that the snow is being picked up times v of
  the truck,</span> <span m='237300'>plus mass of the truck, times v truck,
  dt.</span> </p><p><span m='244500'>Now, the only issue that we have to think
  about here</span> <span m='247600'>is about the rate that the truck, the
  snow,</span> <span m='251090'>is being picked up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='252530'>So that's our last consideration,</span> <span m='254560'>but this
  will be our differential equation</span> <span m='258540'>for adding mass,
  continually, to a system.</span> </p><p><span m='264310'>So, when we found our
  equations for describing the rate</span> <span m='268570'>that the truck
  changes its speed-- the snowplow when it's</span> <span m='271270'>pushing
  snow away, we wrote down our equation</span> <span m='274260'>in terms of the
  external force on the truck, the rate that</span> <span m='277040'>snow is
  being picked up by the truck, the velocity</span> <span m='279400'>of the
  truck, the mass of the truck,</span> <span m='281030'>the rate of change of
  velocity of the truck.</span> </p><p><span m='282863'>If we multiply our
  equation through by dt,</span> <span m='288470'>we have the following
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m='292200'>And now what we want to consider
  is</span> <span m='294070'>we want to focus on how much dms is picked
  up</span> <span m='298490'>in our infinitesimal time, dt.</span> </p><p><span
  m='301840'>So one way to think about that is, let's do a little
  drawing.</span> </p><p><span m='306470'>So here's our truck.</span>
  </p><p><span m='310380'>And let's say at time t-- the plow is right
  here,</span> <span m='313650'>so here's the picture at time t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='316420'>And let's draw some snow here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='322750'>Here in New England we have lots of snow.</span> </p><p><span
  m='325210'>And at time t plus delta t, the truck</span> <span m='330700'>has
  moved a certain distance.</span> </p><p><span m='339940'>And so, this quantity
  is the amount of snow</span> <span m='343560'>that's picked up by the truck
  and displaced.</span> </p><p><span m='346880'>Now, the truck has moved a
  distance v truck delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='353010'>And so, we can
  identify the delta ms, which in the limit</span> <span m='357080'>will be dms,
  is equal to the density of snow times</span> <span m='362070'>the cross
  sectional area of the plow,</span> <span m='364780'>times the length v of
  truck delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='370870'>And so now we have an expression
  for the rate</span> <span m='373820'>that the mass is being picked up in this
  time interval.</span> </p><p><span m='378170'>And we can write that in the
  following way.</span> </p><p><span m='384920'>That we see that our
  differential equation</span> <span m='388440'>Fdt equals dms, which is rho A
  vt,</span> <span m='400200'>times dt-- This will be a small interval,</span>
  <span m='403670'>we're taking a limit now-- times another vt plus mt
  dvt.</span> </p><p><span m='412300'>Now, we can bring this term over to the
  other side.</span> </p><p><span m='415570'>And so we have F minus rho A vt
  squared</span> <span m='421800'>times dt equals the mass of the truck times
  dvt.</span> </p><p><span m='430290'>And the mass of the truck, in this case,
  is fixed.</span> </p><p><span m='432860'>Why?</span> </p><p><span
  m='433780'>Because when the snow gets into the truck,</span> <span
  m='436640'>at the end of this delta t time interval,</span> <span
  m='438955'>it gets displaced to the side.</span> </p><p><span m='441730'>So
  this is an equation that we can separate and integrate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='445680'>So we have dt is equal to mt divided by F minus rho</span> <span
  m='453550'>A vt squared dvt, and we integrate</span> <span m='460650'>from
  some initial time and some final time.</span> </p><p><span m='464659'>And
  here, we're integrating from v of truck</span> <span m='468070'>from some t
  initial time to some final time.</span> </p><p><span m='472490'>And that's our
  integral version for our-- finding the velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='478830'>This interval is an interval that's not hard to do,</span> <span
  m='482050'>that you should try as an exercise</span> <span m='484380'>in
  elementary calculus.</span> </p><p></p>
