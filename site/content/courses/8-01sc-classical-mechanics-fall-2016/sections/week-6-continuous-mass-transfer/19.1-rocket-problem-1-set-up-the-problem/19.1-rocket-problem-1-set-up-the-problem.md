title: 19.1 Rocket Problem 1 - Set up the Problem
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='970'>We'd like to analyze a physics problem called</span> <span
  m='3940'>the rocket problem, in which we have a continuous mass</span> <span
  m='8860'>transfer.</span> </p><p><span m='10180'>Let's see what we mean by
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='11570'>Let's consider a rocket launching.</span>
  </p><p><span m='14260'>So here's a classic example of a rocket that's
  launching off</span> <span m='18330'>in a gravitational field.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20080'>As a rocket starts at rest, it starts to burn
  fuel,</span> <span m='24550'>and ejects the fuel backwards.</span>
  </p><p><span m='26850'>And as the ejected fuel backwards</span> <span
  m='29470'>is producing a thrust on the rocket-- and you can see,</span> <span
  m='32409'>as the rocket starts to rise-- it's</span> <span m='34420'>starting
  to accelerate upwards as fuel is ejected backwards.</span> </p><p><span
  m='39200'>Now, this process goes on for some time interval.</span>
  </p><p><span m='42760'>And a lot of fuel is ejected backwards</span> <span
  m='45190'>during that time interval.</span> </p><p><span m='46660'>In this
  particular case, we could analyze the situation</span> <span m='50080'>from
  the ground frame of the rocket--</span> <span m='52180'>from the ground frame
  of the earth--</span> <span m='54070'>and the fuel is ejected backwards</span>
  <span m='56560'>relative to the rocket, rocket moves up forward.</span>
  </p><p><span m='59810'>So how do we analyze this situation?</span>
  </p><p><span m='63310'>If we just looked at the rocket when the rocket
  initially</span> <span m='66670'>launched, the mass of the rocket is the dry
  mass of the rocket</span> <span m='70930'>plus all the fuel in there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='72550'>It's at rest.</span> </p><p><span m='74200'>In a state
  much later on, the mass of the rocket</span> <span m='77890'>has decreased and
  the speed has increased.</span> </p><p><span m='83260'>But we can't just
  compare this initial to this final state,</span> <span m='87039'>because
  throughout this process, there</span> <span m='89050'>was a continuous mass
  transfer.</span> </p><p><span m='91190'>Fuel was ejected backwards.</span>
  </p><p><span m='93920'>So how do we analyze these types of continuous mass
  transfer</span> <span m='97660'>problems?</span> </p><p><span m='98560'>And
  the key is, again, identifying states.</span> </p><p><span m='102250'>So, for
  a continuous mass transfer problem,</span> <span m='105460'>we always have to
  choose a reference frame.</span> </p><p><span m='109180'>So here, in our
  example, we were choosing</span> <span m='111610'>the ground frame of the
  earth.</span> </p><p><span m='113710'>And then, we want to identify two
  states.</span> </p><p><span m='117940'>We don't want to identify the initial
  and the final states.</span> </p><p><span m='121230'>We want to pick two
  arbitrary states that are separated</span> <span m='124810'>by a small time
  interval.</span> </p><p><span m='126830'>So we can take a state at time
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='130389'>And then our second state occurs at a small
  time afterwards,</span> <span m='134800'>time t plus delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='137800'>And what we want to do is now represent the state
  changes</span> <span m='142270'>by momentum diagrams.</span> </p><p><span
  m='144820'>And that will lead us to a differential equation, which</span>
  <span m='148000'>is called the rocket equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='149650'>And that's how we'll analyze all continuous mass transfer</span>
  <span m='153310'>problems.</span> </p><p><span m='154920'>In applying the
  momentum principle,</span> <span m='157000'>our first thing is just to choose
  a reference frame.</span> </p><p><span m='159400'>So in our example, we're
  going to choose</span> <span m='161440'>the ground frame of the earth as a
  reference frame.</span> </p><p><span m='164470'>Now, the next step is the key
  to these processes.</span> </p><p><span m='168220'>Instead of choosing some
  initial state where the rocket is</span> <span m='171490'>at rest and some
  final state much later on,</span> <span m='174340'>we want to choose two
  states that</span> <span m='176260'>are separated by a small time interval,
  delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='179590'>So our first state, at time t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='183070'>And our second state, we choose at time t plus delta
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='188020'>Now, the next step is that we have</span>
  <span m='190360'>to identify what is our system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='192610'>And so in this case, our system is</span> <span m='196300'>going to
  be the mass of the rocket at time t.</span> </p><p><span m='199840'>That mass
  is the dry mass of the rocket</span> <span m='203050'>plus all the fuel that's
  still in the rocket at time t.</span> </p><p><span m='207100'>And this mass
  will stay the same between times t and t</span> <span m='211400'>plus delta t,
  even though some of the mass</span> <span m='214240'>has been ejected
  downward.</span> </p><p><span m='218620'>So our next step is to look at that
  mass conservation</span> <span m='222100'>of the system.</span> </p>
