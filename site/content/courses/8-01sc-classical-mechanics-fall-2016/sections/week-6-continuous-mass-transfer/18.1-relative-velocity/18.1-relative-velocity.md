  <p><span m='762'>We will practice going between reference frames</span> <span
  m='2720'>to look at relative velocities in one dimension.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6410'>Let's say that an observer is standing on the sidewalk</span> <span
  m='9660'>and that observer sees a car drive</span> <span m='11760'>past to the
  right at a speed of v car.</span> </p><p><span m='15830'>The observer also
  sees a bike that's</span> <span m='17660'>riding to the left at a slower
  speed, v bike.</span> </p><p><span m='22290'>Now, I'm interested in what the
  car looks</span> <span m='24270'>like from the perspective of the bike.</span>
  </p><p><span m='28550'>The bike sees itself as stationary</span> <span
  m='31030'>and sees the world around it moving to the right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='34170'>To the bike, the observer on the sidewalk</span> <span
  m='35930'>appears to be moving to the right with the speed of v bike.</span>
  </p><p><span m='39960'>The car was moving to the right relative to the
  reference</span> <span m='43310'>frame of the observer standing on the
  sidewalk.</span> </p><p><span m='45750'>So to the bike, the car looks like
  it's</span> <span m='47780'>going even faster to the right with a total
  speed</span> <span m='50600'>of v car plus v bike.</span> </p><p><span
  m='55200'>Let's say, later on the biker throws an apple</span> <span
  m='58540'>in the direction of her movement and sees this apple travel</span>
  <span m='63180'>to the left with the speed of v apple.</span> </p><p><span
  m='66700'>Now I want to know what an observer sees</span> <span m='68430'>in
  the stationary frame on the sidewalk.</span> </p><p><span m='71320'>The apple
  appears to be traveling a speed v</span> <span m='73850'>apple faster than the
  biker all to the left.</span> </p><p><span m='77350'>So the observer on the
  sidewalk will see the apple move</span> <span m='82000'>to the left with a
  total speed of v apple plus v bike.</span> </p><p><span m='87780'>Now let's
  say the person throws the apple forward</span> <span m='90360'>at a speed v
  apple.</span> </p><p><span m='92140'>What does the car see?</span>
  </p><p><span m='94060'>To the car the apple is going to the left at the speed
  of v</span> <span m='98360'>car minus v apple.</span> </p><p><span
  m='100950'>How about the bike?</span> </p><p><span m='102789'>To the bike, the
  apple is going at a speed of v apple plus v</span> <span m='107820'>bike to
  the right.</span> </p><p></p>
