title: 19.7 Rocket Problem 7 - Solution with External Forces
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4340'>We've seen the rocket equation, and we've</span> <span
  m='6350'>studied the example when there's no external forces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='8870'>Now, let's consider an example when the external force
  is not</span> <span m='15920'>0.</span> </p><p><span m='17150'>Well, one of
  our examples is just a rocket</span> <span m='19310'>taking off in a
  gravitational field.</span> </p><p><span m='21380'>And so when we want to
  focus on the external forces,</span> <span m='24560'>let's draw our rocket at
  time, t.</span> </p><p><span m='28970'>And now, consider-- what are the force
  diagrams on this rocket?</span> </p><p><span m='32689'>Well, we have a
  gravitational force, mg.</span> </p><p><span m='37190'>So we're going to
  choose j hat up.</span> </p><p><span m='39860'>So now, what does our rocket
  equation look like?</span> </p><p><span m='42590'>We wrote the exhaust
  velocity as minus mu j hat.</span> </p><p><span m='47650'>And so if we write
  this now as a vector equation in the j hat</span> <span m='52490'>component,
  we get minus mg.</span> </p><p><span m='56090'>We have the rate that the
  rocket mass is changing,</span> <span m='62240'>and this is in our-- we have
  this as-- remember,</span> <span m='66740'>dm dr/dt is going to be
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='70200'>So there's a minus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='71750'>And over here, we have another-- this is u because u is
  minus u.</span> </p><p><span m='78080'>And finally, we have m rocket
  dvr/dt.</span> </p><p><span m='84920'>Now, once again, we're going to try to
  integrate--</span> <span m='88570'>this is actually equal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='91460'>And we're going to try to integrate this equation</span> <span
  m='93830'>to find a solution for the velocity as a function of time</span>
  <span m='97850'>when all the fuel is burned.</span> </p><p><span m='100340'>So
  what we do is we'll multiply through by dt,</span> <span m='105630'>and we
  have minus dmr times u equals mr dvr.</span> </p><p><span m='114080'>And this
  is mass of the rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='116630'>And now, let's divide
  through by mass of the rocket,</span> <span m='120080'>so we have minus g
  minus dmr over mru equals dvr.</span> </p><p><span m='131330'>And once again,
  we can integrate this equation</span> <span m='136070'>from some initial time
  to some final time.</span> </p><p><span m='138350'>I'll just denote that by i
  initial and i final,</span> <span m='142700'>and what we see here is we have
  minus g times t final minus t</span> <span m='147560'>initial because we're
  integrating</span> <span m='149270'>with respect to time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150680'>Here, we're integrating mass, so that's minus mu natural
  log.</span> </p><p><span m='155329'>And I'm going to write this as mr final
  over mr initial.</span> </p><p><span m='163579'>And over here, we have vr
  final minus vr initial.</span> </p><p><span m='169310'>And let's just remove
  that time, t.</span> </p><p><span m='174590'>And so now, here is our rocket
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m='178190'>Now, what we notice here is-- let's
  look</span> <span m='179990'>at some rocket taking off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='182370'>So suppose that, at 10 initial equals 0,</span> <span m='187700'>we
  have the special condition that vr initial equals 0</span> <span
  m='193460'>and mr initial equals the mass of the rocket-- dry mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='198650'>That's all.</span> </p><p><span m='199970'>That's not
  counting the fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='201980'>Plus the total mass of the
  fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='206450'>And the final-- at t final, when the
  engine turns off-- we're</span> <span m='212690'>going to try to find this
  velocity at t final.</span> </p><p><span m='216440'>And our condition for the
  final mass</span> <span m='218960'>is all the fuel has been burned, so this is
  just</span> <span m='222140'>the dry mass of the rocket.</span> </p><p><span
  m='224750'>And so what we get is we get minus g t final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='229510'>Now, I'm going to switch the sign here,</span> <span m='233540'>so
  we have-- if I invert the log,</span> <span m='239630'>that will give a minus
  sign.</span> </p><p><span m='241790'>And I have plus u log of mr of d plus
  mass of the fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='251180'>That's the initial mass of
  the rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='253340'>Divided by just the dry mass, and
  that's</span> <span m='258320'>equal to vr at t final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='264140'>So one of the interesting questions that you might ask</span> <span
  m='267170'>is-- how fast should you burn the fuel,</span> <span m='274580'>and
  what will that have to do with the final speed?</span> </p><p><span
  m='277430'>So we can see from this expression</span> <span m='279530'>that, if
  you burn the fuel for a very long period of time--</span> <span m='283290'>so
  t final is big-- then this piece will</span> <span m='286220'>diminish the
  final velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='288320'>So if you want the fastest
  speed after you've burned the fuel,</span> <span m='291830'>you want to burn
  the fuel so that t final is as short as</span> <span
  m='294620'>possible.</span> </p><p><span m='295430'>We have the shortest burn
  time, will give us</span> <span m='297830'>the largest velocity when all the
  fuel has been burned.</span> </p><p></p>
