title: 19.2 Rocket Problem 2 - Momentum Diagrams
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3520'>We would now like to apply the momentum principle to
  analyze</span> <span m='7370'>the motion of the rocket.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8900'>So what is our momentum principle?</span> </p><p><span m='16400'>We
  know that the external force at time t</span> <span m='21580'>is equal to the
  rate of change of the momentum</span> <span m='24110'>of the system over
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='27150'>Now, recall we're going to actually
  use</span> <span m='29640'>the formal definition of a derivative to write
  this</span> <span m='33370'>as a limit as delta t goes to 0 of the
  momentum</span> <span m='37000'>of the system at time t plus delta t</span>
  <span m='41460'>minus the momentum of the system at time t divided by delta
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='47900'>So in order to analyse the rocket,</span>
  <span m='50720'>what we need to do is separately analyze the momentum at our
  two</span> <span m='55480'>states.</span> </p><p><span m='57640'>So we have a
  state at time t.</span> </p><p><span m='60570'>And we have a state at time t
  plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='64230'>And our goal will be to analyze
  the system momentum at time t,</span> <span m='71000'>and separately the
  system momentum and time</span> <span m='75740'>t plus delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='77130'>And then we can apply the momentum principle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='80660'>So let's begin by analyzing the system at time
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='85320'>So recall that at that time, we had our
  rocket</span> <span m='92450'>and this is our time t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='97500'>And the rocket had a velocity V of r or t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='103360'>And what we identified the mass, m-r of t--</span> <span
  m='108060'>recall this was the mass-- the dry mass of the rocket</span> <span
  m='111580'>and the mass of the fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='113390'>And so
  now, it's very simple to write down the momentum</span> <span m='116979'>of
  our system at time t.</span> </p><p><span m='120700'>That's equal to just the
  mass m of r of t times</span> <span m='124880'>the velocity of the rocket at
  time t.</span> </p><p><span m='128500'>And so we can use that in our
  expression</span> <span m='131570'>for the momentum of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='133980'>Now our next step is to consider the system the
  time</span> <span m='137700'>t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='140430'>Now recall, we still have the rocket</span> <span m='144750'>but
  the mass of the rocket has changed.</span> </p><p><span m='148910'>That's
  inside the rocket, so this</span> <span m='150460'>is dry mass of the rocket
  plus mass of the fuel,</span> <span m='153160'>but recall some of the fuel has
  been ejected outwards.</span> </p><p><span m='157370'>So how do we depict that
  in our momentum diagram?</span> </p><p><span m='160210'>Well let's just
  symbolize that by a certain amount</span> <span m='164450'>and we're going to
  call this delta m-fuel.</span> </p><p><span m='169200'>Now, what we need to
  do, again, is to have our velocities.</span> </p><p><span m='174860'>So here,
  the velocity of the rocket</span> <span m='179430'>is now the velocity at time
  t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='183050'>And what about the velocity of
  this fuel that's being ejected?</span> </p><p><span m='187170'>Well, in our
  problem the fuel is ejected at a velocity</span> <span m='192930'>u relative
  to the rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='195850'>So what we have is u is the
  velocity</span> <span m='200660'>of the fuel relative to the rocket.</span>
  </p><p><span m='206390'>But we've been choosing the ground frame</span> <span
  m='210260'>as our reference frame.</span> </p><p><span m='211840'>And the
  rocket is moving at a velocity</span> <span m='213730'>at time t plus delta t
  with respect to that ground frame.</span> </p><p><span m='217300'>And so
  recall that the velocity of the fuel in the ground frame</span> <span
  m='227110'>is equal to the velocity relative to the rocket</span> <span
  m='230260'>plus the speed of the rocket with respect</span> <span
  m='233140'>to the ground frame.</span> </p><p><span m='234930'>And that's what
  we're going to draw on our diagram</span> <span m='239650'>as the fuel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='244310'>And so now we can finish this analysis--</span> <span
  m='247680'>and we'll apply that next-- is to right</span> <span m='250200'>the
  momentum of the system at time t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='253900'>Now this is going to have two terms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='256310'>It has the mass of the rocket at time t</span> <span
  m='259589'>plus delta t times the velocity of the rocket.</span> </p><p><span
  m='267000'>And we also have to add mass of the fuel</span> <span
  m='270530'>times the velocity of the fuel with respect to the ground.</span>
  </p><p><span m='274670'>And now we have the momentum at time t plus delta
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='279490'>So we have both of our pieces here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='282290'>And we still have a little bit of analysis</span>
  <span m='284040'>because we'll use our mass conservation</span> <span
  m='286530'>equation and our relative velocity condition</span> <span
  m='291010'>to simplify this expression.</span> </p><p><span m='293630'>So
  we'll do that next.</span> </p>
