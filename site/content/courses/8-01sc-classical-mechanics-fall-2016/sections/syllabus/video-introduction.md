  <p><span m='2159'> Welcome to Physics 8.01, MITs introductory course in
  classical mechanics for first-year</span> <span
  m='7029'>undergraduates.</span> </p><p><span m='8029'>Im Deepto
  Chakrabarty.</span> </p><p><span m='9350'>And Im Peter Dourmashkin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='11200'>Were the faculty members in charge of this
  course.</span> </p><p><span m='14240'>The science of classical mechanics
  establishes an important principle of cause and effect,</span> <span
  m='18410'>wherein the changes in a bodys motion arise from the application of
  physical forces.</span> </p><p><span m='23640'>Newtons Laws of Motion
  established the scientific principle of analyzing observed</span> <span
  m='28830'>phenomenon through the use of clearly articulated mathematical
  models rather than through intuition.</span> </p><p><span m='34820'>These
  concepts are so important to the modern branches of science and engineering
  that we</span> <span m='38969'>require all of our undergraduates at MIT to
  take classical mechanics regardless of whatever</span> <span m='44579'>course
  they intend to specialize in.</span> </p><p><span m='47020'>In many
  high-school-level physics courses, mechanics is taught as a set of formulas
  to</span> <span m='51530'>memorize for a series of standard situations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='55739'>Our course is different.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56910'>Here, you will learn a set of fundamental principles that you can
  use to apply to unfamiliar</span> <span m='61980'>situations and analyze them
  rather than just situations that you studied previously.</span> </p><p><span
  m='66640'>8.01 assumes a strong background in high school level physics and
  mathematics.</span> </p><p><span m='71649'>We introduce and make extensive use
  of calculus as needed, so a previous course in calculus</span> <span
  m='76660'>is not a prerequisite.</span> </p><p><span m='78070'>However, it is
  a rigorous and technically challenging course aimed at MIT
  undergraduates.</span> </p><p><span m='84010'>8.01s OpenCourseWare site
  contains a coherent set of lessons that will take you through</span> <span
  m='88750'>all the basic concepts of classical mechanics as well as a set of
  advanced topics including</span> <span m='94130'>mass flow, simple harmonic
  motion, and precessional motion.</span> </p><p><span m='98770'>In each of
  these lessons, you will find a series of short lightboard videos that
  will</span> <span m='102989'>help you understand concepts, mathematical
  derivations, and problems solving techniques.</span> </p><p><span
  m='109380'>In addition, you will find many other useful resources including an
  online textbook, many</span> <span m='114240'>worked example problems, and
  MIT-level problem sets.</span> </p><p><span m='118509'>Developing a command of
  mechanics is a powerful tool for understanding the world around us.</span>
  </p><p><span m='124849'>Welcome to 8.01.</span> </p>
