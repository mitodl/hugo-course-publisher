![A diagram of the two masses and pulley that make up the Atwood Machine.](https://open-learning-course-data.s3.amazonaws.com/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/0310ea7232716c47b2f2d1323a9d4a4e_atwood_machine.svg)

A uniform massive pulley of radius \\(R\\) and moment of inertia about its center of mass \\(I\_{A}\\) is suspended from a ceiling. An inextensible string of negligible mass is wrapped around the pulley and attached on one end to an object of mass \\(m\_1\\) and on the other end to an object of mass \\(m\_2\\).

Assume \\(m\_2> m\_1\\). Find the acceleration of the objects.
