title: 35.5 Contact Point of a Wheel Rolling Without Slipping
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3750'>So I would like to now consider the wheel that</span> <span
  m='6450'>is rolling without slipping.</span> </p><p><span m='9330'>And what
  I'd like to do is consider--</span> <span m='13250'>let's draw the wheel
  rolling without slipping.</span> </p><p><span m='15900'>And I'd like to
  consider the contact point between the wheel</span> <span m='24170'>and the
  ground.</span> </p><p><span m='26910'>And I'd like to understand what the
  velocity of that contact</span> <span m='30330'>point is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='30830'>And the result is surprising.</span> </p><p><span m='32820'>Now, we
  know by our law of the addition of velocities--</span> <span m='36350'>let's
  call that the point P--</span> <span m='38840'>that the velocity of P is the
  velocity of the center of mass,</span> <span m='44180'>and that pointed this
  way, plus the velocity of the point</span> <span m='49160'>P as seen in the
  center of mass frame.</span> </p><p><span m='53150'>And in that frame, every
  single point on the rim</span> <span m='56690'>was just doing circular
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='58520'>So that velocity is in the opposite
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='63200'>And the vector sum is the velocity of
  this point P</span> <span m='67520'>as seen in the ground frame.</span>
  </p><p><span m='72210'>So we want to consider the magnitudes of these two
  terms.</span> </p><p><span m='76700'>The velocity in the center of mass
  frame</span> <span m='80570'>of a point on the rim has a magnitude equal to r
  omega.</span> </p><p><span m='87060'>And we said that the velocity of the
  center of mass,</span> <span m='91789'>we call that V cm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='94580'>Now, the rolling without slipping condition</span> <span
  m='99590'>was that these two magnitudes were equal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='102270'>V cm equals r omega, or the velocity</span> <span m='107690'>of the
  point on the rim in the center of mass frame</span> <span m='110150'>is equal
  to the center of mass velocity of the wheel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='114710'>And therefore, the velocity P, which</span> <span m='118880'>is the
  sum of these two vectors for the contact point--</span> <span m='125630'>so
  that's when P is in contact with the ground--</span> <span m='130639'>is equal
  to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='132950'>So what we say is that the contact
  point</span> <span m='139910'>is instantaneously at rest with respect to the
  ground.</span> </p><p><span m='157210'>And that's what really is the mystery
  of a wheel that's</span> <span m='160260'>rolling without slipping-- that this
  contact point is</span> <span m='163680'>the sum of these two vectors, and
  it's</span> <span m='165750'>instantaneously at rest with the ground</span>
  <span m='167910'>when the wheel is rolling without slipping.</span>
  </p><p><span m='170280'>The other points are certainly not.</span>
  </p><p><span m='172890'>Remember, up here, these two vectors pointed</span>
  <span m='176760'>in the same direction, so that vector has twice the
  magnitude</span> <span m='182280'>of either one.</span> </p><p></p>
