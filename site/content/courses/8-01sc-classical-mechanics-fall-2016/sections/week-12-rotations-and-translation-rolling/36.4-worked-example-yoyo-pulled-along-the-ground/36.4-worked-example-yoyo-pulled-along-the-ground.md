  <p><span m='3170'>I'd now like to consider a very unusual problem,</span>
  <span m='5610'>and we saw a demo of this.</span> </p><p><span m='7660'>Suppose
  you have a yoyo, and the yoyo an inner radius</span> <span m='12510'>b and an
  outer radius R. And the yoyo</span> <span m='16140'>is rolling without
  slipping along the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='22710'>And what we have here
  is we're pulling the yoyo</span> <span m='26880'>with a string that's wrapped
  around the spool,</span> <span m='29640'>and I want to find F max such that it
  rolls without slipping.</span> </p><p><span m='37002'>If I don't pull it hard
  enough, the wheel</span> <span m='38710'>will roll without slipping.</span>
  </p><p><span m='40630'>And if I pull it harder, then this F max,</span> <span
  m='44230'>the wheel will start to slip.</span> </p><p><span m='47360'>So now
  let's analyze this problem,</span> <span m='49900'>and let's use our dynamics
  approach.</span> </p><p><span m='52930'>Let's choose an i hat, a j hat, k
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='58540'>As before, we'll define an angle
  theta.</span> </p><p><span m='61280'>And now we'll apply both Newton's second
  law</span> <span m='64420'>for linear motion and our torque about the center
  of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='69850'>Now, we have to consider our
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='72270'>So I'm going to put the forces on this
  diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='75310'>We have the normal force from the
  ground pointing up.</span> </p><p><span m='79360'>We have the gravitational
  force pointing down.</span> </p><p><span m='82000'>And remember, it's rolling
  without slipping.</span> </p><p><span m='84860'>So the wheel is--</span> <span
  m='86980'>the contact point is instantaneously at rest.</span> </p><p><span
  m='89860'>But because the center of mass of the wheel</span> <span
  m='93310'>is accelerating, once again, in order to keep a equal to R</span>
  <span m='99970'>alpha, then we need some type of torque</span> <span
  m='103300'>that will produce a non-zero alpha.</span> </p><p><span
  m='105590'>And that's going to come from a non-zero static friction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='109330'>So once again, we have a case, unlike a wheel which is
  just</span> <span m='113410'>rolling along a horizontal plane,</span> <span
  m='115120'>because we're pulling this yoyo's string,</span> <span
  m='117789'>the static friction is not 0.</span> </p><p><span m='119740'>Static
  friction depends on everything else</span> <span m='122380'>that's happening
  in the system.</span> </p><p><span m='124390'>And now we can apply Newton's
  second law, F equals ma.</span> </p><p><span m='129070'>And so in our x
  direction, we have F minus F equals ma.</span> </p><p><span m='136045'>And if
  we look at the torque about the center of mass</span> <span m='141160'>is Icm
  alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='143680'>Then this is our x equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='146079'>Now here, both the pulling force and the static
  friction</span> <span m='152410'>both exert torques about the center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='155380'>The static friction will exert a torque
  in the direction k hat,</span> <span m='159520'>and the pulling force will
  exert a torque in the minus k hat</span> <span m='164920'>direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='166190'>So our torques-- the normal force</span> <span
  m='169270'>does not produce any torque about the center of mass,</span> <span
  m='171970'>nor does gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='173930'>So what we have is
  fs times the radius of the wheel--</span> <span m='178150'>that is the torque
  due to static friction--</span> <span m='180910'>minus b times the pulling
  force F,</span> <span m='186010'>and that's equal to Icm alpha.</span>
  </p><p><span m='190190'>So we have our two dynamic equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='193330'>And again, let's recopy our rolling</span> <span
  m='197440'>without slipping condition, now expressed</span> <span
  m='200050'>in terms of acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='202190'>So now
  what I'd like to do is solve</span> <span m='204400'>for this force F. And the
  way I'll do</span> <span m='208030'>it is I'll write down, from this
  condition, alpha</span> <span m='212230'>in terms of a/R. And from this
  equation, I have that--</span> <span m='218160'>so alpha is a/R. And from the
  top equation,</span> <span m='223110'>I have that a is F minus f static over
  mR, times R.</span> </p><p><span m='231030'>So I can replace the alpha in this
  equation,</span> <span m='234329'>and I get fsR minus bF is Icm F minus fs
  over mR.</span> </p><p><span m='244900'>And now I just need to collect
  terms.</span> </p><p><span m='247840'>I'll bring the static friction term to
  this side and my f term</span> <span m='251430'>to that side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='252750'>And so I get fs times R. And when</span> <span
  m='256950'>I bring the static friction term over to that other side,</span>
  <span m='259930'>I get Icm over mR.</span> </p><p><span m='262920'>Let's just
  check dimensions.</span> </p><p><span m='264930'>Icm is mR squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='267180'>So these terms have the dimensions of length,</span>
  <span m='269210'>so looks like I'm OK.</span> </p><p><span m='272070'>And now
  I bring the F to the other side,</span> <span m='275130'>and I get F times b
  plus Icm over mR. I can now solve for F,</span> <span m='283860'>and I get f
  static R plus Icm m/R--</span> <span m='290500'>it's a complicated
  answer--</span> <span m='291990'>divided by b plus Icm divided by mR.</span>
  </p><p><span m='298350'>Now, if I want to ask the question, what</span> <span
  m='302670'>is the maximum force I can pull in which it just slips,</span>
  <span m='307050'>what's physically happening is the harder I pull,</span>
  <span m='309660'>the bigger the static friction is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='311640'>I pull harder, static friction gets bigger.</span> </p><p><span
  m='313710'>I pull harder, static friction gets bigger.</span> </p><p><span
  m='315780'>But static friction can only have a maximum value.</span>
  </p><p><span m='319680'>That hasn't changed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='321550'>The maximum value of static friction</span> <span m='324030'>is the
  coefficient of static friction times</span> <span m='326850'>a normal force,
  which, in this case,</span> <span m='328950'>is just normal balance in
  gravity, mg.</span> </p><p><span m='332580'>So this is the maximum value that
  static friction can have.</span> </p><p><span m='337030'>And so now I get F
  max--</span> <span m='341250'>this is, again, a little complicated-- mu s mg
  times R</span> <span m='346770'>plus Icm divided by mR divided by b plus Icm
  divided by mR.</span> </p><p><span m='361250'>And that is the maximum force
  that I</span> <span m='365000'>can pull this yoyo with that it still rolls
  without slipping.</span> </p>
