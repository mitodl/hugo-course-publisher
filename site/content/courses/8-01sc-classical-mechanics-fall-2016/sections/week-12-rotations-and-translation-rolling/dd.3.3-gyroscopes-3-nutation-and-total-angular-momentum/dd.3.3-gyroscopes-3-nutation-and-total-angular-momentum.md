  <p><span m='3500'>Now, we've been discussing steady uniform precession,</span>
  <span m='6530'>which is the simplest possible case of a phenomenon that</span>
  <span m='9650'>can be much more complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='11400'>As
  an example and the case we've been discussing</span> <span m='13400'>so far
  where we release a gyroscope from rest when it's</span> <span
  m='17510'>horizontal, very careful measurements</span> <span m='20060'>would
  show that the initial motion isn't</span> <span m='22250'>just steady
  precession but has some additional motion</span> <span m='25390'>superimposed
  on it.</span> </p><p><span m='28640'>The spin axis sort of bounces or
  nods</span> <span m='31250'>up and down as it precesses.</span> </p><p><span
  m='33980'>However, friction at the pivot point</span> <span m='35510'>causes
  the amplitude of the nodding</span> <span m='37280'>to rapidly decay until it
  settles into steady precession.</span> </p><p><span m='41330'>This nodding
  motion is called nutation.</span> </p><p><span m='44090'>In our example, it
  decays so quickly</span> <span m='46490'>that we don't even notice it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='48960'>But if you had a perfectly frictionless pivot
  point,</span> <span m='52040'>it would be a more noticeable effect.</span>
  </p><p><span m='54320'>And it would persist for much longer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='57770'>Now, there's an interesting point</span> <span
  m='59270'>about our horizontal gyroscope that I'd like to point out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='67600'>So here is my rod of length d.</span> </p><p><span
  m='69560'>This is my point s.</span> </p><p><span m='73050'>Here's my wheel
  that's rotating with some angular velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='79390'>And
  again, there's the r hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='82830'>That's the
  direction that little omega vector's pointing in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='86060'>That's the k hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='90240'>And that's
  the theta hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='92680'>Now, before I release
  it, before I release the gyroscope</span> <span m='96509'>from rest, the
  angular momentum vector</span> <span m='99150'>points in the r hat direction,
  as drawn at this instant.</span> </p><p><span m='104550'>When I release it
  from rest, there</span> <span m='106830'>is a torque acting in the theta
  hat</span> <span m='109140'>direction that causes the angular momentum</span>
  <span m='112170'>vector to rotate.</span> </p><p><span m='114600'>And we've
  seen this in some detail.</span> </p><p><span m='118344'>But there's something
  else to keep</span> <span m='119759'>in mind, which is that now when the
  system is precessing,</span> <span m='124350'>that means that the center of
  mass of the wheel</span> <span m='128639'>is orbiting around the z-axis, the
  vertical axis,</span> <span m='133050'>through this pivot point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='136470'>So you can think of that as a point mass with the full
  mass</span> <span m='141329'>of the gyroscope moving in a circular path around
  point</span> <span m='148650'>s with a radius d.</span> </p><p><span
  m='151829'>That implies that there must be a component of angular
  momentum</span> <span m='156840'>pointing in the k hat direction, pointing
  along</span> <span m='159960'>the z-axis, corresponding to the translational
  motion</span> <span m='164550'>of the center of mass, the circular
  translational motion</span> <span m='167520'>of the center of mass, of the
  gyroscope around the z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='173950'>But where did that
  k component come from?</span> </p><p><span m='176650'>There was no initial z
  component of the angular momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='179500'>We said that
  initially the angular momentum just pointed</span> <span m='182530'>in the r
  hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='184720'>And there's no torque in the k
  hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='187120'>The only torque is in the theta
  hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='190670'>So how do we end up with some
  angular momentum pointing</span> <span m='194522'>in the k hat
  direction?</span> </p><p><span m='195480'>This seems to violate the
  conservation</span> <span m='198010'>of angular momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='201079'>The solution to this puzzle is that, in fact, the gyroscope</span>
  <span m='204640'>doesn't remain precisely horizontal when I release it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='209050'>Instead, it dips by a very small angle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='214930'>So that's the horizontal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='216160'>After I release it, the gyroscope's</span> <span
  m='218860'>actually dipped downward by a small amount.</span> </p><p><span
  m='221770'>I've exaggerated it considerably in this drawing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='224165'>We'll call that angle delta theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='229810'>That small dip gives the small negative component</span> <span
  m='235570'>of the spin angular momentum that's</span> <span m='238180'>able to
  balance the plus z angular</span> <span m='242040'>momentum due to the motion
  center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='244840'>Now, because the spin angular
  momentum vector</span> <span m='247960'>has such a large magnitude--</span>
  <span m='253120'>that's my spin angular momentum vector--</span> <span
  m='259950'>only a small angle is necessary in order</span> <span m='263550'>to
  get enough of a negative Lz component</span> <span m='266790'>to balance out
  the Lz corresponding</span> <span m='269730'>to the center of mass
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='272490'>OK?</span> </p><p><span m='274860'>But
  what we see is that although gyroscopes</span> <span m='277560'>seem like a
  remarkable system, they're not magic.</span> </p><p><span m='281850'>And, in
  fact, angular momentum is conserved.</span> </p><p><span m='289070'>The larger
  little omega is, the faster</span> <span m='292240'>the spin angular velocity
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='293750'>And, therefore, the larger the vector
  L</span> <span m='296100'>is, the smaller that angle is and the less of a
  dip</span> <span m='300720'>that you get.</span> </p><p><span m='302640'>So
  now we can write the exact angular momentum</span> <span m='305910'>for the
  gyroscope.</span> </p><p><span m='316310'>This is my distance d.</span>
  </p><p><span m='317990'>This is my pivot point s.</span> </p><p><span
  m='322770'>My spin angular velocity looks like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='326010'>Here is the r hat direction, the k hat direction, and the
  theta</span> <span m='332159'>hat direction into the screen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='336360'>And we're orbiting-- the precession is around</span>
  <span m='340880'>the z-axis with an angular speed capital omega.</span>
  </p><p><span m='345960'>Now, recall that the total angular</span> <span
  m='350430'>momentum with respect to point s can be written in two
  parts.</span> </p><p><span m='358659'>There's the angular momentum due to the
  translational motion</span> <span m='363930'>of the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='365150'>And we know the center of mass is just</span> <span
  m='367350'>orbiting around the z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='370290'>So I'll
  call that, in fact, the orbital angular momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='377260'>So this is due to the translation</span> <span m='383160'>of the
  center of mass with respect to point s.</span> </p><p><span m='387660'>And
  then the second term is due to the rotational angular</span> <span
  m='394440'>momentum, or spin angular momentum,</span> <span
  m='399540'>relative to the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='401220'>So
  this is due to rotation about the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='409780'>So again, the general angular momentum of a rigid body</span> <span
  m='413409'>is equal to the center of mass translational angular</span> <span
  m='419300'>momentum plus the angular momentum due to rotation,</span> <span
  m='422350'>a pure rotation, about the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='425140'>So let's write each of these terms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='428690'>The orbital angular momentum, that</span> <span m='433540'>is the
  translational angular momentum of the center of mass,</span> <span
  m='436390'>is just due to the motion of the center of mass</span> <span
  m='440800'>of the gyroscope, which is at radius d with respect</span> <span
  m='445360'>to point s, moving in a circle with angular speed capital</span>
  <span m='450370'>omega.</span> </p><p><span m='452900'>So that's equal to the
  mass times the center</span> <span m='458409'>of mass velocity times the
  radius of the circle.</span> </p><p><span m='464140'>And that angular momentum
  is in the k hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='469940'>But the center of
  mass velocity is</span> <span m='472210'>just equal to-- since it's a circular
  motion--</span> <span m='474340'>is just equal to the radius of the
  circle,</span> <span m='476560'>d, times the angular speed of the circular
  motion</span> <span m='480100'>of the center of mass, which is capital
  omega.</span> </p><p><span m='482890'>So I can write this as m capital omega
  d</span> <span m='491620'>squared in the k hat direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='494930'>So that's the angular momentum due to the translational
  motion</span> <span m='499930'>of the center of mass around point s,</span>
  <span m='502690'>what I'm calling the orbital angular momentum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='506450'>Now, the spin angular momentum, we've</span> <span
  m='512169'>been talking about the rapid spin</span> <span m='515380'>of the
  wheel around its axis.</span> </p><p><span m='520539'>So that's given by the
  moment of inertia</span> <span m='525490'>about that axis times the spin
  angular velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='531380'>And that's pointing in the r
  hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='536890'>But there's a subtlety
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='538780'>It turns out that is not the only
  rotation</span> <span m='542140'>about the center of mass that this wheel is
  undergoing.</span> </p><p><span m='546520'>And actually because of that, I'm
  going to call this I1.</span> </p><p><span m='550480'>And let me just draw a
  picture here.</span> </p><p><span m='553000'>So for my disk rotating around
  this axis,</span> <span m='564580'>the relevant moment of inertia is what I'll
  call I1.</span> </p><p><span m='569250'>And for a disk, we know that would be
  1/2 m r squared.</span> </p><p><span m='577960'>The other rotation is a subtle
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='582190'>Notice in this drawing, suppose I</span>
  <span m='584200'>were to draw a dot on the outside face of the wheel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='592870'>When this wheel precessed around 180 degrees</span>
  <span m='595600'>to the other side, that dot on the outside</span> <span
  m='600280'>would be facing in the minus r hat direction now</span> <span
  m='603520'>or would be pointing to the left rather than to the right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='608980'>And what that means is that this disk has
  actually</span> <span m='612310'>rotated about its diameter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='614560'>So this disk has rotated around a diameter like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='622050'>And that rotation is at the slower
  angular speed capital</span> <span m='626375'>omega.</span> </p><p><span
  m='630040'>And it takes one full orbit for it to rotate entirely
  around.</span> </p><p><span m='634210'>If that rotation weren't
  happening--</span> <span m='638879'>this wouldn't make sense physically the
  way</span> <span m='640670'>I have this set up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='641720'>But as an object, if that rotation weren't happening,</span> <span
  m='644540'>what that would mean is that this face with a dot on it</span>
  <span m='648710'>would always be pointing to the right as the disk moved
  around.</span> </p><p><span m='653600'>If it had an independent pivot point
  right at the center,</span> <span m='656707'>it would be physically possible
  for it to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='658790'>That's not what's happening
  in this case.</span> </p><p><span m='660498'>In this case, this face is always
  pointing outward,</span> <span m='663740'>radially away from the pivot
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='666260'>And that results in a rotation around
  this diameter.</span> </p><p><span m='670460'>Now, it turns out that moment of
  inertia, which I'll call I2,</span> <span m='674732'>happens to be half the
  moment of inertia for this axis.</span> </p><p><span m='679620'>So in this
  case, it's one 1/4 m r squared.</span> </p><p><span m='686350'>So that is
  another kind of rotation</span> <span m='689860'>that's happening about the
  center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='691630'>And so there's an additional
  angular momentum term</span> <span m='695950'>arising from that
  rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='698780'>And that's equal to I2 times the
  angular</span> <span m='703510'>velocity of that rotation, which is capital
  omega.</span> </p><p><span m='708310'>And because the axis there is the
  z-axis,</span> <span m='712360'>this is pointing in the k hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='718270'>So the total angular momentum of the
  gyroscope</span> <span m='728530'>is I1 times omega in the r hat direction
  plus I2 times</span> <span m='738040'>capital omega in the k hat
  direction</span> <span m='742270'>plus m capital omega d squared in the k hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='753320'>The first term, the r hat
  component,</span> <span m='756620'>is the only part that's rotating.</span>
  </p><p><span m='760650'>So this is a rotating vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='766870'>The k hat terms are constant.</span> </p><p><span m='773140'>This
  is the exact expression for the angular momentum</span> <span m='776530'>of a
  gyroscope.</span> </p><p><span m='777700'>And now we see the gyroscopic
  approximation more precisely</span> <span m='783430'>is saying that this
  rotating term dominates</span> <span m='786790'>over the other two
  terms.</span> </p><p><span m='788440'>So it's actually that this term is very
  large compared</span> <span m='791440'>to either of these two terms, which, as
  we can see,</span> <span m='794470'>is roughly equivalent to saying that
  little omega is very</span> <span m='797410'>large compared to big
  omega.</span> </p>
