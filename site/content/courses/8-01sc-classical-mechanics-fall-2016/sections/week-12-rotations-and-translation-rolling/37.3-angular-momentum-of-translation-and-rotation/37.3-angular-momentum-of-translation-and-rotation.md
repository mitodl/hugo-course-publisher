title: 37.3 Angular Momentum of Translation and Rotation
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3520'>We've already talked about kinetic energy</span> <span
  m='5380'>for an object that's rotating and translating.</span> </p><p><span
  m='7780'>Let's take, again, a simple object like a wheel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='10300'>Center of mass is moving, and we want</span> <span m='12580'>to
  consider this is a bunch of point-like particles,</span> <span m='16280'>th
  Jth particle with mass MJ, and a position vector RCMJ.</span> </p><p><span
  m='22510'>And now what we'd like to do is, what is the angular momentum</span>
  <span m='26740'>of this about some point P?</span> </p><p><span m='29950'>And
  we're going to do the same type of decomposition</span> <span m='32290'>that
  we've been doing right along.</span> </p><p><span m='34190'>Let's draw the
  vector RJ.</span> </p><p><span m='36640'>This is the vector from the point P
  to the object.</span> </p><p><span m='40900'>Here's the vector capital R, and
  there's the vector RCMJ.</span> </p><p><span m='45490'>And our same vector
  addition, R plus RCMJ.</span> </p><p><span m='51720'>j Now let's calculate the
  angular momentum</span> <span m='55510'>about the point P. Now just
  let's</span> <span m='58150'>recall two facts about the center of mass
  reference frame</span> <span m='63390'>that we've already used.</span>
  </p><p><span m='67350'>The first is that the sum of the velocities, the
  momentum</span> <span m='74830'>in the center of mass reference frame is
  zero,</span> <span m='77380'>and if you integrate this equation in just
  exactly</span> <span m='80470'>the same way, if you added up the mass times
  each</span> <span m='86600'>of the position vectors, that's MJ,</span> <span
  m='89900'>MJ, in the center of mass frame, that's also zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='93630'>So we've used this when we talked about kinetic
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='97800'>Now we're going to consider both of
  these results.</span> </p><p><span m='100860'>So recall that angular momentum
  about a point</span> <span m='106729'>is the sum of the vector from the point,
  cross-product MJ,</span> <span m='114710'>times the velocity BJ.</span>
  </p><p><span m='117920'>Now we can also use our law of addition
  velocities,</span> <span m='121790'>VJ is V plus the VCMJ, and so now</span>
  <span m='128910'>we're going to have to do both substitutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='132060'>That's why this calculation is a little bit more
  complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='136270'>We have R plus RCMJ, cross MJ
  times capital</span> <span m='145390'>D. That is the velocity of the center of
  mass</span> <span m='149070'>with respect to the ground frame plus
  VCMJ.</span> </p><p><span m='154650'>Now we have four terms in the
  cross-product,</span> <span m='158100'>and this time we'll write them all
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='161440'>So the first term is the sum over J of R
  cross MJ capital D.</span> </p><p><span m='171540'>The second term is, we'll
  take this one,</span> <span m='175200'>and we'll cross with that one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='176490'>But because MJ is just a scalar, I'm going to pull it
  in front.</span> </p><p><span m='180990'>So that's MJ, RCMJ, and V is the same
  for every single particle</span> <span m='188190'>in the object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='189390'>Remember, V is just the velocity of one reference
  frame</span> <span m='192780'>with respect to the other.</span> </p><p><span
  m='194100'>So I can pull that out, cross V. And you're already noticing</span>
  <span m='199380'>that this term will be zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='201640'>The next term is when I take R cross</span> <span m='205170'>MJVJ,
  V center of mass, J, summed over J,</span> <span m='210260'>that's JR cross
  MJ, VCMJ.</span> </p><p><span m='218620'>But again, remember that R is the
  same vector.</span> </p><p><span m='222970'>It's just from P to the center of
  mass,</span> <span m='225400'>so I didn't need to put the sum here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='228430'>I can pull R out of the sum and I have my sum like
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='234310'>And again, you're probably noticing that
  this term is zero</span> <span m='236740'>and our final term is RCMJ cross MJ
  VCMJ.</span> </p><p><span m='242350'>So our final term is sum R, RCMJ cross MJ
  VCMJ.</span> </p><p><span m='253270'>Now from these two conditions, one and
  two,</span> <span m='256899'>both of these two terms are zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='260829'>And that's the power of using the center of mass
  reference</span> <span m='264700'>frame.</span> </p><p><span m='265510'>So LP,
  now let's look at the first term.</span> </p><p><span m='269290'>Here, R is
  the same for every particle,</span> <span m='272060'>V is the same for every
  particle,</span> <span m='274000'>when we're summing over the mass,</span>
  <span m='275620'>we're just getting the total mass,</span> <span m='277510'>so
  the first piece is R cross M total V.</span> </p><p><span m='282610'>And this
  last piece is precisely the definition of the angular</span> <span
  m='287380'>momentum of the Jth particle in the center of mass frame.</span>
  </p><p><span m='292600'>So that's the sum over J of LCMJ,</span> <span
  m='297490'>because RCM cross MVJ R cross, say whatever speed this</span> <span
  m='304540'>is in the center of mass frame, it could be that sum VCMJ.</span>
  </p><p><span m='310330'>BJ minus capital V.</span> </p><p><span
  m='312070'>This is exactly the angular momentum</span> <span m='315010'>of
  that Jth mass in the center of mass frame,</span> <span m='318460'>and when we
  total all of this up, we have R cross</span> <span m='324540'>and total V plus
  LCM.</span> </p><p><span m='328810'>Now what this first term is, if you
  treated the whole object</span> <span m='334780'>as a point mass, M total,
  moving with V, and here's our point P</span> <span m='340480'>and there's R,
  this is just what we</span> <span m='343090'>call the translational angular
  momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='350050'>It's treating the whole system as a
  point-like mass,</span> <span m='353500'>and just calculate moving with speed
  V,</span> <span m='356320'>and that's just the angular momentum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='358450'>We've called this V.</span> </p><p><span
  m='363290'>And this piece is the angular momentum about center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='372360'>So sometimes, we can think of the angular
  momentum</span> <span m='375480'>as corresponding to a translational,</span>
  <span m='380010'>it has to do with the actual orbit of the object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='383610'>You could call this orbital angular momentum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='385810'>And this is the fact that the object is
  rotating.</span> </p><p><span m='389050'>You could think of this as the spin
  angular momentum</span> <span m='392010'>about the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='393750'>This is the same type of decomposition</span> <span
  m='395940'>that we saw with kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='397710'>There was a translational component of kinetic energy</span> <span
  m='400590'>and a rotational component of kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='403980'>This is the analogous case for angular momentum about a
  point</span> <span m='408450'>P.</span> </p><p></p>
