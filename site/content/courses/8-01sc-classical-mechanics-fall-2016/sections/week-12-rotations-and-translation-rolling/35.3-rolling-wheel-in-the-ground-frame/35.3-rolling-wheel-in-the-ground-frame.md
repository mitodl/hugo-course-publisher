  <p><span m='3520'>So now what we'd like to do is try</span> <span m='5500'>to
  understand how to apply the law of addition of velocities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8600'>So we can express the velocity of the point</span> <span m='10510'>on
  the rim in the reference frame fixed to the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m='13690'>Now, the important thing to realize</span> <span m='15400'>is v is
  the velocity of the center of mass</span> <span m='19300'>of the wheel with
  respect to the ground,</span> <span m='21190'>and every single point on the
  wheel has that same velocity v.</span> </p><p><span m='25780'>So let's draw a
  picture of our wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='28720'>Here we're in the ground
  reference frame.</span> </p><p><span m='33080'>And let's first draw four
  points on the wheel</span> <span m='41090'>and draw this velocity v. Every
  single one of these points</span> <span m='45140'>has the same velocity v, v,
  v, and v.</span> </p><p><span m='54475'>Now, let's add to that the
  velocity</span> <span m='59280'>of a point on the rim as seen in the reference
  frame</span> <span m='62050'>moving with the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='64239'>We just saw that every single point on the wheel</span>
  <span m='67480'>is undergoing circular motion in that reference frame.</span>
  </p><p><span m='70120'>So now let's draw those velocities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='73539'>I'll just draw it right below--</span> <span m='75490'>vcmp, down
  here vcmp.</span> </p><p><span m='81730'>Notice here it's in the opposite
  direction, vcmp,</span> <span m='86320'>and up here it's pointing up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='90680'>So when we add these two vectors together, what we
  get</span> <span m='94750'>is a longer vector in this direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='97750'>It would be the sum of these two pieces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='100570'>So it would point like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='102640'>That's vp.</span> </p><p><span m='104229'>Over here it's the vector
  decomposition.</span> </p><p><span m='108729'>So it's in that
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='109830'>Here it's a shorter vector
  vp.</span> </p><p><span m='113460'>And over here it's the vector sum
  vp.</span> </p><p><span m='117970'>So now what we've been able to do</span>
  <span m='120010'>is describe the velocity of the point p</span> <span
  m='122600'>as a combination, the vector addition,</span> <span m='125530'>of
  how the center of mass of the wheel is moving</span> <span m='128680'>and the
  circular motion as seen in a reference frame moving</span> <span
  m='132190'>with the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='134080'>Now what we
  want to explore is special conditions,</span> <span m='137440'>which we'll
  refer to as rolling without slipping, slipping,</span> <span m='141790'>or
  sliding.</span> </p><p></p>
