  36.2 Worked Example - Wheel Rolling Without Slipping Down Inclined Plane -
  Torque Method
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3140'>Now let's go back and analyze that same problem</span> <span
  m='5980'>that we were looking at before of a wheel</span> <span
  m='9010'>rolling down an incline plane.</span> </p><p><span m='11290'>And it's
  rolling without slipping.</span> </p><p><span m='15760'>But instead of using
  the energy method,</span> <span m='18220'>we're now going to use the torque
  method.</span> </p><p><span m='21340'>So let's consider the center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='24670'>And what we want to do is draw the
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='26800'>We have a normal force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='28930'>We have gravity.</span> </p><p><span m='30670'>And we
  have the friction force about the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34840'>Our wheel has a radius R.</span> </p><p><span m='37870'>Let's choose
  a coordinate system i hat, j hat.</span> </p><p><span m='42280'>And so we have
  a right-handed system k hat,</span> <span m='45160'>and that will correspond
  to some angle theta.</span> </p><p><span m='49270'>Now here we're now going to
  enlarge how we apply</span> <span m='54160'>both translation and
  rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='56920'>And the beauty of this problem
  is</span> <span m='58750'>we now can decompose our motion into translational
  motion</span> <span m='64030'>and rotational motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='65630'>So for the transitional motion, we'll</span> <span m='67660'>apply
  Newton's second law.</span> </p><p><span m='71240'>Now, if this is the angle
  phi, then that's</span> <span m='73990'>the angle phi as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='75789'>And so our forces in the i hat direction, we</span>
  <span m='79120'>have mg sine phi minus the friction force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='85240'>And that's equal to the x component of the acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='91180'>Now we also can choose the center of mass</span> <span
  m='95050'>to calculate the torque.</span> </p><p><span m='98320'>And so what
  we're really just studying here</span> <span m='100300'>is simply our old
  problem in the center of mass frame of fixed</span> <span m='104890'>axis
  rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='106390'>And you can see gravity is acting at
  the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='109450'>So it produces no torque
  about the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='112120'>The normal force is
  directed towards the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='116470'>And so
  when we take that vector product of R cross n from cm</span> <span
  m='126520'>to this point down here, the contact point,</span> <span
  m='128710'>these forces are anti-parallel.</span> </p><p><span m='130538'>So
  the normal force produces no torque.</span> </p><p><span m='132970'>And the
  only torque that we have is from the friction force,</span> <span
  m='136960'>and that friction torque is going</span> <span m='138940'>to give
  us a positive angular acceleration in the k hat</span> <span
  m='142750'>direction.</span> </p><p><span m='143640'>It's at right angles with
  the vector R.</span> </p><p><span m='146270'>So we have fs times R equals I
  center of mass times alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='153620'>And these are our
  two dynamic equations.</span> </p><p><span m='157420'>But remember, when the
  object is rolling without slipping,</span> <span m='160780'>let's just remind
  ourselves that Vcm equals R omega.</span> </p><p><span m='165560'>And if I
  differentiate, the Acm which is what we're calling ax,</span> <span
  m='170560'>is equal to R alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='173829'>So this ax here
  is the acceleration</span> <span m='177520'>of the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='179079'>And that's our third condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='182330'>And so now I see that I have three equations</span> <span
  m='186820'>and my unknowns--</span> <span m='189530'>fs, ax and alpha.</span>
  </p><p><span m='192270'>And so I'm going to solve these equations for
  a.</span> </p><p><span m='196290'>And I'll look at these equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='198130'>And what I'll do is I'll just substitute for alpha ax
  over R.</span> </p><p><span m='204280'>And then solve this equation for fs,
  and put it in there.</span> </p><p><span m='208750'>And so I get mg sine
  phi.</span> </p><p><span m='212500'>Now my fs is equal to Icm over R times
  alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='219360'>But alpha is ax over R. So that's ax and
  an R squared.</span> </p><p><span m='225470'>Notice dimensionally, I is mr
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='228950'>So this is just ma, the
  dimensions</span> <span m='231550'>of force, mg dimensions of force, and
  that's equal to max.</span> </p><p><span m='236950'>And now I can solve for
  ax.</span> </p><p><span m='240280'>And I get mg sine phi divided by m plus Icm
  over R squared.</span> </p><p><span m='251020'>Now ax is a constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='255790'>And we can, from our kinematic equations,</span> <span
  m='259390'>if our object is moving a distance s</span> <span m='268704'>as it
  drops height h, we know from kinematics</span> <span m='274159'>and we can
  work this out.</span> </p><p><span m='275750'>We have that Xcm is one half Acm
  t squared.</span> </p><p><span m='282930'>And we know that the velocity Vcm
  equals Acm times t.</span> </p><p><span m='293930'>And so when we put these
  two together,</span> <span m='296510'>this is the distance s, we get that the
  velocity</span> <span m='302110'>cm is equal to the square root of 2s times
  Acm.</span> </p><p><span m='312600'>Now s is equal to h over sine phi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='321990'>S h over s is sine phi.</span> </p><p><span
  m='326140'>And so the Vcm equals the square root of 2h sine phi times
  Acm--</span> <span m='334390'>but we've solved for Acm--</span> <span
  m='336040'>mg sine phi over m plus Icm over R squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='344290'>And so we get the square root of 2mgh</span> <span m='350290'>over
  m plus Icm divided by R squared.</span> </p><p><span m='356650'>And this
  agrees with our energy method.</span> </p>
