title: 35.1 Translation and Rotation of a Wheel
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3510'>Let's consider a wheel that's rolling.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5790'>So our wheel is rolling along a surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m='9870'>The wheel has radius r.</span> </p><p><span m='11730'>And I want to
  consider the motion of a point P</span> <span m='15150'>on the rim of the
  wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='16740'>Now, I'll choose an origin that's
  fixed.</span> </p><p><span m='20970'>And in fact, here we're going to talk
  about the reference frame</span> <span m='26910'>A, which is fixed to the
  ground.</span> </p><p><span m='33420'>And I would like to consider-- my
  problem is</span> <span m='36570'>to find both the position of the point on
  the rim,</span> <span m='40050'>the velocity of the point on the rim,</span>
  <span m='42120'>and the acceleration of the point in the rim</span> <span
  m='44430'>as a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='46660'>Now, the
  position vector is given from my fixed origin</span> <span m='51180'>to where
  the point on the rim is.</span> </p><p><span m='53190'>Now, this can be quite
  complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='55300'>But what we're going to do is
  consider a second reference</span> <span m='57930'>frame that is located at
  the center of mass of the wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='63700'>So our second
  frame, we'll take reference frame</span> <span m='70680'>and we'll call this
  frame cm, is located,</span> <span m='74530'>is moving with the center of mass
  of the wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='87870'>So in that reference frame,
  we'll</span> <span m='89930'>denote this point by vector r cm,</span> <span
  m='94729'>because we're in the reference frame with respect</span> <span
  m='96770'>to the center of mass, and we're talking about the point P.</span>
  </p><p><span m='100820'>Now, these vectors are connected.</span> </p><p><span
  m='103770'>And we'll call this vector capital</span> <span m='105410'>R. By
  our vector triangle, capital R equals little rP--</span> <span
  m='112039'>that's the position vector.</span> </p><p><span m='113660'>And the
  fixed frame of the ground is given by capital</span> <span m='116509'>R plus r
  cm P.</span> </p><p><span m='121670'>Now, as we've seen before by
  differentiating,</span> <span m='125090'>the velocity of the particle is
  given</span> <span m='127310'>by V plus V cm P. This one is the velocity in
  frame</span> <span m='139570'>fixed to the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m='145790'>This is the velocity of the center of mass</span> <span
  m='155845'>with respect to ground frame.</span> </p><p><span m='163250'>And
  finally, V cm P is the velocity</span> <span m='170180'>in the center of mass
  frame.</span> </p><p><span m='178260'>Now, in order to analyze this law, what
  we'll now do</span> <span m='182040'>is focus on what the motion looks</span>
  <span m='186000'>like if you're an observer moving with the center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='189840'>And that's how we'll begin our
  analysis.</span> </p><p></p>
