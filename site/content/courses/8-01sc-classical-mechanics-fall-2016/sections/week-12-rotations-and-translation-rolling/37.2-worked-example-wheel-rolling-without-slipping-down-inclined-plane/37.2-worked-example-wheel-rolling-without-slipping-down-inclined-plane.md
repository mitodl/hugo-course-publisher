title: 37.2 Worked Example - Wheel Rolling Without Slipping Down Inclined Plane
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3460'>Let's now consider how to find the velocity</span> <span
  m='7120'>of the center of mass of a wheel that's rolling without
  slipping</span> <span m='10930'>down an inclined plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12790'>So let's draw a picture.</span> </p><p><span m='15130'>Here is the
  wheel that starts at t equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m='20320'>And this is an
  angle phi.</span> </p><p><span m='23740'>And at some later time t final, the
  wheel</span> <span m='28480'>has dropped a distance h along the incline
  plane.</span> </p><p><span m='35110'>And now let's figure out what is the
  velocity</span> <span m='38590'>of the center of mass of the wheel</span>
  <span m='41800'>when it gets to the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m='43540'>And
  we're now going to apply our energy arguments.</span> </p><p><span
  m='48740'>Now the first thing we have to realize is a very subtle point</span>
  <span m='52180'>here is that there can be friction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='58630'>And we saw that when a wheel is rolling without slipping,</span>
  <span m='61870'>there can be static friction at the contact</span> <span
  m='66070'>point between the wheel and the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m='68700'>There is a gravitational force.</span> </p><p><span m='71520'>And a
  normal force.</span> </p><p><span m='73800'>Now static friction does no work
  because the point is always</span> <span m='84840'>instantaneously at rest and
  f dot ds is 0</span> <span m='90960'>because the object is at rest.</span>
  </p><p><span m='94900'>And so the ds is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='97680'>So
  our static friction does no work.</span> </p><p><span m='100680'>And
  therefore, from our energy principle</span> <span m='103289'>that the external
  work equals E final minus E initial,</span> <span m='109800'>we have no
  external work and so our energy is constant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='117210'>Now how do we analyze our energy?</span> </p><p><span
  m='119759'>Well, I've set things up.</span> </p><p><span m='121120'>So I'm
  going to choose my potential energy to be 0</span> <span m='125370'>when it's
  at the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m='127380'>And that our initial energy is
  only equal to potential energy.</span> </p><p><span m='133350'>If the wheel
  has a mass m, gravitational force down,</span> <span m='137670'>the potential
  energy initially is mgh.</span> </p><p><span m='141060'>The final energy is
  only kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='146160'>The wheel is rolling with
  omega final.</span> </p><p><span m='149310'>Its center of mass is moving with
  v center of mass final.</span> </p><p><span m='152670'>And we just saw that
  the kinetic energy</span> <span m='155610'>has two contributions; the
  translational kinetic energy,</span> <span m='159530'>1/2 m--</span> <span
  m='160320'>we'll just call this final squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='164220'>And we'll make that the final just to make it easier.</span>
  </p><p><span m='168000'>And it has the kinetic energy of rotation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='174190'>Now the rolling without slipping condition</span>
  <span m='177060'>is that the translational center of mass speed</span> <span
  m='179760'>is equal to the radius of the wheel,</span> <span m='182250'>r,
  times the angular speed, omega final.</span> </p><p><span m='187440'>So I can
  write E final as 1/2 of m plus I</span> <span m='194320'>cm over r squared
  times the final squared, where I'm just</span> <span m='202260'>replacing
  omega final equals v final over r.</span> </p><p><span m='207690'>And
  therefore, that the kinetic energy by the energy principle</span> <span
  m='214230'>tells us that E initial equals E final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='216900'>So mgh equals 1/2 times m plus I cn</span> <span m='223110'>over r
  squared v final square.</span> </p><p><span m='225810'>So we can find that v
  final is equal to the square root of 2</span> <span m='232500'>mgh divided by
  m plus 1/2 cm r square.</span> </p><p><span m='240510'>And that is the final
  speed of the center</span> <span m='243840'>of mass translational's velocity
  of the wheel</span> <span m='247110'>as it dropped a height h.</span> </p>
