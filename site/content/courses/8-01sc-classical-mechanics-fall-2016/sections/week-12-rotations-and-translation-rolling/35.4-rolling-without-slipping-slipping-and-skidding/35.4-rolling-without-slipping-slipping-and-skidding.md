  <p><span m='3030'>Let's now consider our rolling wheel,</span> <span
  m='4830'>and we want to look at some special conditions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='7140'>So at time t equals 0--</span> <span m='12300'>and we'll have our
  wheel that's rolling, here's the ground--</span> <span m='16290'>let's say
  that our point P is right up here at the top.</span> </p><p><span
  m='21540'>That's cm.</span> </p><p><span m='22290'>And we'll be in the ground
  frame now.</span> </p><p><span m='26130'>And then at a later time, time
  t,</span> <span m='31360'>the wheel has moved to the right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='34070'>So let's draw the wheel over here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='37586'>Not the greatest picture of the wheel,</span> <span m='40280'>but
  we'll have the wheel over here.</span> </p><p><span m='43230'>And now the
  point P has moved some angle delta theta.</span> </p><p><span m='50890'>And
  we'll call this time interval delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='55100'>Now, the
  center of mass of the wheel has moved a distance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='60020'>Xcm is the velocity of the center of mass times delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='66710'>And the point P on the rim, this arc change,</span>
  <span m='71490'>this length here on the rim that P</span> <span m='73400'>has
  moved around in the center of mass frame,</span> <span m='78890'>is R delta
  theta.</span> </p><p><span m='86670'>Now, we want to ask ourselves-- we'll
  call this delta x.</span> </p><p><span m='90780'>We now have three possible
  conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='94500'>We call rolling without
  slipping.</span> </p><p><span m='101890'>That will be our first case 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='103960'>And that's the case when the arc length</span> <span
  m='107440'>delta s is exactly equal to the distance along the ground.</span>
  </p><p><span m='113050'>So we have delta Xcm is delta s.</span> </p><p><span
  m='119680'>And so we get Vcm delta t equals R delta theta,</span> <span
  m='126880'>or Vcm equals R delta theta over delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='133570'>Now, in the limit as delta t goes to 0,</span> <span m='138670'>we
  have that delta theta over delta t</span> <span m='142600'>in this limit as
  delta t goes to 0 is d theta dt</span> <span m='147490'>And that's what we
  called the angular speed.</span> </p><p><span m='151090'>So in our limit as
  this wheel is rolling without slipping,</span> <span m='156130'>we have the
  condition that the velocity Vcm equals R omega.</span> </p><p><span
  m='167370'>So that's our first condition, and we call this the rolling</span>
  <span m='170062'>without slipping.</span> </p><p><span m='170770'>Now what is
  Vcm?</span> </p><p><span m='172070'>Vcm?</span> </p><p><span m='173120'>That's
  the velocity of the center of mass of the wheel,</span> <span m='176870'>and
  every single point on this wheel has that same speed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='180390'>And R omega, you can think of that as the tangential
  velocity</span> <span m='187620'>in reference frame cm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='194240'>This is just the speed in the reference frame</span> <span
  m='197570'>moving with the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='201410'>So
  this is our condition for rolling without slipping.</span> </p><p><span
  m='206230'>Now, our second case is imagine that the wheel is not</span> <span
  m='215710'>moving forward at all, but it's just spinning.</span> </p><p><span
  m='219190'>That's what we call the wheel is slipping on the ground,</span>
  <span m='221800'>for instance, if there were ice.</span> </p><p><span
  m='223960'>And so what we call slipping is a little bit more general.</span>
  </p><p><span m='227920'>It's whenever the wheel is spinning,</span> <span
  m='231250'>and the arc length is much greater</span> <span m='233620'>than the
  horizontal distance that the wheel has moved.</span> </p><p><span
  m='236380'>So we have delta s representing the arc length</span> <span
  m='239867'>that the point has moved in the center</span> <span m='241450'>of
  mass frame is greater than how far the center of mass</span> <span
  m='246670'>is moving.</span> </p><p><span m='248030'>And so, again, we have R
  delta theta is greater than Vcm delta</span> <span m='254860'>t, or in the
  limit R omega is greater than Vcm.</span> </p><p><span m='261190'>You can say
  it's spinning faster than it's translating.</span> </p><p><span m='265600'>And
  finally, the skidding condition.</span> </p><p><span m='271480'>Skidding--
  imagine that the wheel-- you're braking a wheel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='274750'>The wheel is not spinning at all,</span> <span m='276550'>but it's
  just sliding along horizontally.</span> </p><p><span m='280430'>So the
  horizontal delta x center of mass</span> <span m='284150'>is bigger than delta
  scm.</span> </p><p><span m='287900'>And so this is the case where delta Xcm,
  how far it moved</span> <span m='291980'>horizontally, is greater than the
  amount of arc length</span> <span m='296510'>that the point moved.</span>
  </p><p><span m='298520'>And so in the same type of argument,</span> <span
  m='300830'>when we put our conditions in we get that Vcm</span> <span
  m='306740'>is greater than R omega.</span> </p><p><span m='311240'>And again,
  what that corresponds to in the skidding case,</span> <span m='314880'>imagine
  the limit where it's not rotating at all,</span> <span m='317630'>this would
  be 0, and it's just skidding along the ground, Vcm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='322850'>So we have our three conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='325740'>We
  have the slipping condition, where it's spinning</span> <span
  m='330240'>faster than it's translating.</span> </p><p><span m='333150'>We
  have the skidding condition, where</span> <span m='335700'>it's translating
  faster than it's spinning.</span> </p><p><span m='339840'>And we have the
  rolling without slipping condition,</span> <span m='343050'>in which the arc
  length is exactly</span> <span m='347909'>equal to the distance, horizontal
  distance,</span> <span m='350850'>along the ground.</span> </p><p></p>
