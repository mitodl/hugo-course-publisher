title: 36.1 Friction on a Rolling Wheel
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3420'>When a wheel is rolling without slipping, as we saw
  before,</span> <span m='7090'>that the contact point here, the contact
  point</span> <span m='13690'>is instantaneously at rest.</span> </p><p><span
  m='21380'>Now, if the wheel is rolling on a surface with friction,</span>
  <span m='25880'>then it's possible that we may have a static friction
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='31550'>So there could be static friction may
  act.</span> </p><p><span m='40800'>However, static fiction is always</span>
  <span m='42990'>depends on the circumstances.</span> </p><p><span
  m='45430'>Now let's just consider two cases.</span> </p><p><span
  m='48340'>Suppose here's a wheel, Vcm.</span> </p><p><span m='51330'>This is a
  horizontal surface.</span> </p><p><span m='55560'>And in that case, the static
  friction,</span> <span m='59280'>if the wheel is rolling with velocity
  V,</span> <span m='61470'>in this case f static is 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='65280'>And because of that, the wheel will</span> <span m='67350'>roll
  without any friction, which is an idealization.</span> </p><p><span
  m='72090'>There's other types of friction called rolling resistance,
  air</span> <span m='75300'>resistance, et cetera, which will slow the wheel
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='77880'>But in a perfect hard wheel, idealized
  wheel in a vacuum,</span> <span m='81660'>it will keep on rolling.</span>
  </p><p><span m='83460'>However, if a wheel is going down an incline
  plane</span> <span m='88230'>and it wants to maintain the rolling without
  slipping</span> <span m='92610'>condition--</span> <span m='94390'>so here we
  have Vcm.</span> </p><p><span m='97710'>And it has some angular speed--</span>
  <span m='100180'>we have to be careful because in this case</span> <span
  m='102870'>if we differentiate Acm is our alpha.</span> </p><p><span
  m='107940'>So what is making the wheel spin faster?</span> </p><p><span
  m='111750'>It has a non-zero, angular acceleration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='119700'>And if we looked at the forces acting on the wheel,</span> <span
  m='123540'>then we have a normal force.</span> </p><p><span m='126230'>We have
  gravity acting at the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='131009'>And we
  also have static friction.</span> </p><p><span m='135300'>And it's precisely
  the static friction</span> <span m='142340'>that is producing a torque about
  the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='155270'>And that torque about the
  center of mass</span> <span m='158300'>will produce an angular
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='161790'>So in order for the wheel to
  continue</span> <span m='164450'>rolling without slipping, it must</span>
  <span m='166550'>have both a linear acceleration, which</span> <span
  m='168410'>comes from gravitational force component going down</span> <span
  m='172295'>an inclined plane minus the friction plus the alpha</span> <span
  m='177320'>is coming from the torque.</span> </p><p><span m='179750'>And so
  this side, if we wrote it as a vector</span> <span m='181970'>equation, the
  torque about the center of mass</span> <span m='185060'>would be the vector
  from--</span> <span m='189300'>let's right this is r cm to where</span> <span
  m='194770'>the static friction is acting.</span> </p><p><span m='197170'>So
  that's the vector r cm F static cross f static.</span> </p><p><span
  m='203050'>So in this case, f static is non-zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='207490'>So there are many circumstances in which static friction can</span>
  <span m='211540'>vary between a zero value, some possible value,</span> <span
  m='217060'>and some maximum value.</span> </p><p><span m='218829'>And here we
  see one more example.</span> </p><p><span m='221650'>In order for the wheel to
  continue to accelerate down</span> <span m='225880'>the inclined plane and
  roll without slipping</span> <span m='228310'>that the static friction must
  produce a torque</span> <span m='231340'>that causes the angular
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='234160'>And so we see that static
  friction</span> <span m='237280'>depends on the other constraints in the
  problem.</span> </p><p></p>
