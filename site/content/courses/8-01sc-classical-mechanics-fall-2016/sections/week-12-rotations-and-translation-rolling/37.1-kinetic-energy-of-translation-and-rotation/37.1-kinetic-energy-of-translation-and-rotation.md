title: 37.1 Kinetic Energy of Translation and Rotation
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3360'>Let's consider the motion of a wheel that's</span> <span
  m='5760'>rolling along the ground with some center of mass velocity</span>
  <span m='10320'>vcm.</span> </p><p><span m='11820'>And because the wheel is
  rotating</span> <span m='13830'>it has an angular velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='15970'>And you can see that that vector is directed</span>
  <span m='18960'>into the plane of the board.</span> </p><p><span
  m='22770'>Now, what we'd like to do is consider the kinetic energy</span>
  <span m='25860'>of this continuous body.</span> </p><p><span m='27660'>A
  little bit later on, that body has moved some distance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='33210'>And what we want to consider is the fact</span> <span m='35880'>that
  not only is every point in the body moving</span> <span m='38430'>with the
  center of mass speed, but there's</span> <span m='40650'>this additional
  rotational energy</span> <span m='44820'>that's associated with the fact that
  every point</span> <span m='47190'>in the center of mass reference
  frame</span> <span m='48840'>is undergoing circular motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='50650'>So how do we describe that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='52900'>Well, we'll do that by choosing some point in the body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='57190'>So let's pick a point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='58900'>We'll call that mj, with mass mj.</span> </p><p><span m='63090'>And
  the velocity of this point, remember, has two components.</span> </p><p><span
  m='68910'>To simplify it, we'll give ourselves</span> <span m='70860'>a little
  more picture here.</span> </p><p><span m='74820'>Every single point in the
  object has the vcm.</span> </p><p><span m='80250'>But because this object is
  undergoing circular motion,</span> <span m='84420'>there is vcmj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='88020'>That's the rotational circular tangential
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='92320'>And so the vector sum of these
  two</span> <span m='94950'>is the actual velocity vj of the j-th
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='100770'>vj is equal to the center of mass
  velocity</span> <span m='105090'>plus the tangential rotational velocity that
  it has,</span> <span m='109289'>because it's undergoing circular
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='113220'>And now what we'd like to do is
  calculate the kinetic energy</span> <span m='116280'>of this object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='117479'>Well, the kinetic energy is the sum j from 1 to
  n</span> <span m='122880'>of 1/2 mj times the velocity of this j-th particle
  squared,</span> <span m='130259'>which we can take as a dot product.</span>
  </p><p><span m='132910'>So we can write that as vcm plus vcmj dot vcm plus
  vcmj.</span> </p><p><span m='147900'>And that's just vj squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='151870'>So when we look at these terms, it looks complicated
  at first.</span> </p><p><span m='155430'>But there's some nice-- there's going
  to be vcm dot vcm.</span> </p><p><span m='159480'>There's two cross
  terms.</span> </p><p><span m='161050'>They're identical.</span> </p><p><span
  m='162490'>And vcmj dot vcmj.</span> </p><p><span m='165030'>So let's write
  out those three terms.</span> </p><p><span m='168690'>We have 1/2 mj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='170970'>vcm dot vcm is vcm squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='176070'>Now, every point in the object has the same vcm.</span>
  </p><p><span m='180840'>So we can pull that one out of the sum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='185300'>And now we'll take these cross terms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='188520'>So we have the sum over j from 1 to n.</span>
  </p><p><span m='192780'>There's two cross terms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='194940'>So the 2's are going to cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='197100'>And
  inside here, we have to remember</span> <span m='200430'>to keep our mass
  element.</span> </p><p><span m='202230'>That's important.</span> </p><p><span
  m='203460'>Now, I'm going to write it as mj vcmj vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='209579'>Now, remember, when you dot with vcm,</span> <span m='213060'>every
  single point has the same vcm.</span> </p><p><span m='216120'>Every j-th
  element has the same vm,</span> <span m='218520'>so I can pull that vcm
  outside.</span> </p><p><span m='222570'>And finally, I have the last
  term,</span> <span m='224650'>which is the sum over j from 1 to n of 1/2 mj
  vcmj squared.</span> </p><p><span m='234660'>And that's just the dot product
  of those two terms.</span> </p><p><span m='237480'>And so our kinetic energy
  looks rather complicated,</span> <span m='240810'>but let's focus on this term
  right here.</span> </p><p><span m='244380'>Because recall from our video on
  the center of mass</span> <span m='247800'>that the definition of the center
  of mass reference frame,</span> <span m='253000'>so if you're moving in the
  center of mass,</span> <span m='257040'>that in the center of mass reference
  frame, the sum of mj</span> <span m='262960'>vcmj is equal to 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='270020'>So for instance, if you're in the center of mass
  frame,</span> <span m='274190'>you're moving with vcm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='275870'>The only velocity is this.</span> </p><p><span m='278090'>And in
  that frame, the sum of mj vcmj is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='282380'>And we did
  a video on that one before.</span> </p><p><span m='285180'>And that's exactly
  what's in this term.</span> </p><p><span m='287250'>So this term is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='290420'>So this, remember, was how we defined the
  center</span> <span m='294170'>of mass reference frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='300340'>And therefore, our kinetic energy consists of two pieces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='304360'>This first piece is just 1/2 the total mass times vcm
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='311650'>And our second piece over here, we'll
  just write it out now--</span> <span m='316430'>1/2 sum over j mj vcmj
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='324350'>Now, if you are moving with the center
  of mass,</span> <span m='328070'>then this j-th object is just undergoing
  circular motion.</span> </p><p><span m='332690'>And so we have our result that
  we've</span> <span m='336640'>used many times is that the velocity,</span>
  <span m='340630'>the tangential rotational velocity,</span> <span
  m='343300'>is just equal to the radius rsj--</span> <span m='346380'>so let's
  introduce that rsj--</span> <span m='351570'>times the angular speed
  omega.</span> </p><p><span m='358470'>And when we put that into this
  term,</span> <span m='360630'>we see our kinetic energy has two
  pieces--</span> <span m='364450'>m total v center of mass squared plus 1/2 j
  goes from 1 to n--</span> <span m='372870'>I didn't finish that sum
  there--</span> <span m='375340'>mj rsj squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='379480'>Now, just remember that every single point in the object</span>
  <span m='384900'>has the same angular speed, and so we can pull out</span>
  <span m='390300'>the omega squared in there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='395550'>And because this is a continuous body and we take the limit,</span>
  <span m='401760'>as we've done before, as mj goes to 0,</span> <span
  m='405480'>this quantity of mass times distance</span> <span
  m='408390'>squared is just the moment of inertia</span> <span m='410760'>about
  the center of mass of that body.</span> </p><p><span m='413250'>And in
  conclusion, K is 1/2 m total v center</span> <span m='417909'>of mass squared
  plus 1/2 the moment of inertia</span> <span m='421920'>about the center of
  mass times the angular speed squared.</span> </p><p><span m='429490'>Now, this
  is the same crucial decomposition</span> <span m='432240'>that we've talked
  about many times.</span> </p><p><span m='434190'>This first piece is what we
  call the translational kinetic</span> <span m='438450'>energy, because it just
  represents how</span> <span m='440940'>the center of mass is moving.</span>
  </p><p><span m='443310'>And the second piece is what we call</span> <span
  m='445980'>the rotational kinetic energy, because it's</span> <span
  m='448860'>a representation of just the kinetic energy of rotation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='453480'>For example, if you were in the center of mass
  frame,</span> <span m='456090'>there would be no translational energy,</span>
  <span m='457830'>and this would be the only kinetic energy.</span> </p><p></p>
