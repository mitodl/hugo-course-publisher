transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4690'>We begin with multiplication of a vector by a scalar.</span>
  </p><p><span m='8460'>When you multiply a vector, A, by a scalar,</span> <span
  m='12150'>this multiplicative factor just rescales the magnitude</span> <span
  m='15490'>or the length of the vector.</span> </p><p><span m='18040'>Let us
  look at the vector 2 times</span> <span m='20130'>A. This is in the same
  direction as the vector A,</span> <span m='24190'>but is twice as long.</span>
  </p><p><span m='27000'>This is vector B. A vector is defined</span> <span
  m='30250'>by its magnitude and direction.</span> </p><p><span m='32170'>So
  this vector B is the same anywhere in space,</span> <span m='34900'>including
  at the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='36870'>If I want minus 0.5 times B, this
  vector</span> <span m='40250'>is in the opposite direction of B and is half
  the length.</span> </p><p><span m='46890'>Now let's look at vector
  addition.</span> </p><p><span m='49610'>Here's a vector A. Here is B. How do
  we add them graphically?</span> </p><p><span m='55290'>We slide the tail of B
  to the head of A.</span> </p><p><span m='57765'>And their sum is a vector
  drawn from the tail of A</span> <span m='60860'>to the head of B. I could have
  also added A to B</span> <span m='65670'>by sliding the tail of A to the head
  of B.</span> </p><p><span m='69539'>You can see that this makes a
  parallelogram,</span> <span m='72340'>and the sum, vector C, is just the
  diagonal</span> <span m='75699'>of this parallelogram.</span> </p><p><span
  m='79660'>Subtraction can be thought of as just multiplication</span> <span
  m='83490'>and addition.</span> </p><p><span m='85380'>If I have C is equal to
  A minus B,</span> <span m='88289'>I just need to add A to the vector minus B.
  Minus B</span> <span m='93900'>is negative 1 times B, which is this vector
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='98740'>Now I only have to add A to minus
  B.</span> </p><p><span m='103090'>Let's do another example.</span>
  </p><p><span m='105490'>Here are my vectors A and B do not start at the
  origin.</span> </p><p><span m='109410'>But since vectors are the same anywhere
  in space,</span> <span m='111680'>I can go through the process here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114280'>I want A minus B. So I first multiply B by minus
  1</span> <span m='118670'>to find minus B. And then I move the tail of minus
  B</span> <span m='124140'>to the head of A and add the two like this.</span>
