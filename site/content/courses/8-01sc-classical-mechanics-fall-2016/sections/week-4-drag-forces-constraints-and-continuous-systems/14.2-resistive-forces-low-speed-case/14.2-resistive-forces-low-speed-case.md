  <p><span m='3000'>We'd like to consider velocity-dependent resistive</span>
  <span m='5470'>forces.</span> </p><p><span m='6480'>So let's imagine a
  situation where we have an object,</span> <span m='9990'>and it's falling in a
  gravitational field,</span> <span m='12470'>so we have a gravitational
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='14640'>And this object is like a marble falling
  in a vat of oil.</span> </p><p><span m='21060'>And there is a
  velocity-dependent resistive</span> <span m='24440'>force that is acting on
  this object.</span> </p><p><span m='27910'>And let's again choose the positive
  direction down.</span> </p><p><span m='31350'>And now for objects that are
  moving very slowly in a fluid,</span> <span m='36270'>let's make a model for
  our velocity-dependent resistive</span> <span m='39090'>force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='39805'>We will assume that the resistive force is</span> <span
  m='42160'>proportional to the velocity, it's</span> <span m='44790'>opposing
  the direction of motion,</span> <span m='46760'>and we'll put a coefficient
  alpha in front.</span> </p><p><span m='49990'>And this is our model for
  velocity-dependent resistive</span> <span m='53510'>forces for objects that
  are moving very slowly.</span> </p><p><span m='56700'>For our case, let's
  consider the units of the coefficient alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='60500'>So
  the units of alpha have the units</span> <span m='63100'>of force divided by
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='65900'>So the units of force are-- we have
  the units of force divided</span> <span m='71090'>by the units of velocity,
  and that</span> <span m='73050'>gives us kilogram meter per second squared,
  divided</span> <span m='77230'>by the units of velocity, which are velocity
  per second.</span> </p><p><span m='80930'>And so we see that the coefficient
  of alpha</span> <span m='83190'>has the units of kilogram per inverse
  second.</span> </p><p><span m='89990'>Now what we'd like to do is apply
  Newton's Second Law.</span> </p><p><span m='92680'>So let's analyze the forces
  and get the equation of motion</span> <span m='99729'>for this object falling
  in a viscous medium</span> <span m='101620'>with a resistive force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='103590'>In the j hat direction, we have the gravitational
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='107000'>And we have our resistive friction
  force,</span> <span m='110220'>which we're writing Vy as the y component of
  the velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='113340'>And that's equal to m times dVy
  dt.</span> </p><p><span m='117750'>Now notice that the acceleration--</span>
  <span m='119289'>we're not treating as a constant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='121130'>It's a derivative of the velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='123460'>This leads us to our differential equation, which</span> <span
  m='126330'>is written as dy dt-- I'll divide through</span> <span
  m='130550'>by m-- g minus alpha over m, Vy.</span> </p><p><span m='135100'>Now
  this is a linear and velocity first order</span> <span m='139610'>differential
  equation with a constant term in here,</span> <span m='143520'>which is called
  inhomogeneous linear first order differential</span> <span
  m='146890'>equation.</span> </p><p><span m='147630'>We shall solve this like
  we did with our other equations</span> <span m='149990'>by separation of
  variables.</span> </p><p><span m='151880'>So what we do is we bring the
  velocity terms</span> <span m='156880'>to one side and the time terms to the
  other side.</span> </p><p><span m='161140'>And now we can integrate both sides
  directly.</span> </p><p><span m='163640'>But before I integrate this
  side,</span> <span m='165250'>I'd like to rewrite it by writing it as
  dVy--</span> <span m='168810'>and I'd like to pull out a minus alpha over
  m.</span> </p><p><span m='172320'>And this term here becomes minus mg over
  alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='176320'>Why did I do this?</span> </p><p><span
  m='177630'>For the integration, it just makes my natural logarithm</span>
  <span m='180940'>interval look a little bit easier.</span> </p><p><span
  m='182940'>And over here, I had dt.</span> </p><p><span m='185290'>Now what I
  want to do is integrate.</span> </p><p><span m='187440'>And we're going to
  integrate from some initial velocity,</span> <span m='189790'>which we're
  going to take to be 0,</span> <span m='191620'>we're going to let this object
  be released from rest,</span> <span m='194970'>and we're going to integrate to
  some final speed Vy of t.</span> </p><p><span m='199490'>Over here, let's just
  call our integration variable t prime.</span> </p><p><span m='203520'>And we
  integrate t prime from 0 to some time t.</span> </p><p><span m='208130'>So
  this is our variable and the velocity as a function of time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='212640'>Now doing this interval-- first off,</span> <span
  m='215260'>this constant term comes out.</span> </p><p><span m='217150'>So we
  have 1 over minus alpha over m.</span> </p><p><span m='220096'>And the
  interval is just a natural log integral</span> <span m='223020'>of Vy minus mg
  over alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='227100'>And we have to divide that in the
  lower limit, Vy is 0,</span> <span m='231390'>and we have just minus mg over
  alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='234810'>And this side is very simply t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='237530'>Now we can rewrite this equation by bringing the
  m</span> <span m='241070'>over alpha to the other side.</span> </p><p><span
  m='243010'>And we have log of Vy minus mg alpha, over minus mg alpha,</span>
  <span m='255090'>equals minus alpha m t.</span> </p><p><span m='259529'>Now
  recall that e to the log of any quantity x is equal to x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='265840'>So if I exponentiate both sides, I</span> <span m='268930'>get Vy
  minus mg over alpha, divided by minus mg alpha,</span> <span m='276470'>is
  equal to the exponential e to the minus alpha m t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='280970'>Now the last step is simply to bring this over to there,</span>
  <span m='284220'>multiply, and do a little bit of algebra.</span> </p><p><span
  m='286850'>And so I get that the velocity as a function of y</span> <span
  m='290760'>is equal to mg alpha times 1 minus e to the minus alpha m t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='300302'>Now there's a few interesting things here</span> <span
  m='302010'>that we want to look at.</span> </p><p><span m='303060'>Suppose we
  define this exponential e</span> <span m='307380'>to the minus alpha m t as
  equal to e to the minus t over tau,</span> <span m='313920'>where tau is m
  over alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='319180'>The units of tau, when we look at
  the units,</span> <span m='322510'>it has the units of mass, which is</span>
  <span m='325130'>kilograms, over the units of alpha, which we worked
  out</span> <span m='328011'>before.</span> </p><p><span m='328510'>So we have
  kilograms over kilogram inverse second.</span> </p><p><span m='332450'>That
  gives us units of seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='334710'>And that's what we
  would expect because t seconds over seconds</span> <span m='338120'>gives us
  dimensionless quantity for the exponential.</span> </p><p><span m='341440'>Now
  the last thing we'd like to look at</span> <span m='343820'>is let's just see
  what happens when we plot this.</span> </p><p><span m='348840'>Well, if we're
  plotting Vy as a function of t,</span> <span m='355460'>we start off at
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='357740'>And we're going to reach some terminal
  quantity Vy</span> <span m='362670'>terminal, which is when we have a graph
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='368960'>And we can see what that terminal
  speed</span> <span m='371160'>is when we set t equal to infinity,</span> <span
  m='374340'>e to the minus infinity is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='378680'>And so
  this terminal speed is equal to just this coefficient,</span> <span
  m='383690'>mg over alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='386870'>And that's the
  terminal speed.</span> </p><p><span m='389590'>Now notice, that as a check for
  what we did,</span> <span m='392740'>we can come back to our differential
  equation,</span> <span m='395980'>and what does terminal speed mean?</span>
  </p><p><span m='398580'>Notice that when you get to this limit,</span> <span
  m='400980'>as t approaches infinity, the slope of the velocity curve</span>
  <span m='404659'>is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='405990'>And that's really the
  statement over here</span> <span m='408700'>that Vy terminal is when the
  velocity is no longer changing</span> <span m='421760'>in time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='423060'>You can see it graphically.</span> </p><p><span
  m='424820'>And this is the statement, when we go back to Newton's
  Second</span> <span m='427720'>Law, that acceleration is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='433070'>So the sum of the forces at terminal speed is
  0,</span> <span m='436280'>the resistive force is equal to the gravitational
  force,</span> <span m='440290'>and so from this equation here, as a
  check,</span> <span m='443680'>we can see that Vy terminal equals mg over
  alpha, which</span> <span m='451880'>checks with our calculation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='454430'>And so we have confidence that we analyzed this
  correctly.</span> </p><p><span m='459080'>And that gives us our motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='462610'>One last thing that's quite interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='466050'>Notice that the terminal speed depends on mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='470210'>This coefficient alpha is only a function</span> <span
  m='473320'>of the properties of the object--</span> <span m='475020'>the size,
  the shape, the geometric properties</span> <span m='476990'>of the object, not
  how dense it is.</span> </p><p><span m='479250'>So if you have two objects,
  like two balls, same radius,</span> <span m='482510'>but one was denser than
  the other, then the other mass</span> <span m='486450'>would be heavier and
  the terminal speed</span> <span m='489120'>would be greater.</span>
  </p><p><span m='490260'>So what we see is that two identical objects, one
  heavier</span> <span m='492740'>than the other, the heavier object</span>
  <span m='494790'>reaches a faster terminal speed than the lighter object,
  which</span> <span m='498270'>explains a well observed phenomenon.</span>
