  <p><span m='3830'>We want to look at this pulley system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6110'>We want to find out what this force here</span> <span m='9170'>is,
  for example, with which this block is being pulled.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12880'>Now we have two massless pulleys here and two moving parts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='17350'>And one key component of this problem</span> <span
  m='20510'>is to derive the acceleration constraint.</span> </p><p><span
  m='23970'>How are we going to do that?</span> </p><p><span m='25690'>Well, we
  have to look at this string here.</span> </p><p><span m='29730'>First of all,
  it's a fixed string length.</span> </p><p><span m='31930'>And that will help
  us.</span> </p><p><span m='34470'>Ultimately, this is just a distance
  that</span> <span m='36990'>connects all of these objects.</span> </p><p><span
  m='39820'>And if we eventually differentiate that twice,</span> <span
  m='42950'>we get to an acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='44810'>So the
  first thing we're going to do</span> <span m='46480'>is to figure out what the
  string length is to then derive</span> <span m='52610'>the acceleration
  condition.</span> </p><p><span m='54620'>Let's begin by first identifying the
  fixed</span> <span m='57630'>length in this problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='59430'>So we have a little distance here.</span> </p><p><span m='62950'>We
  call it sb.</span> </p><p><span m='66030'>And we have a distance here that's
  fixed, sa.</span> </p><p><span m='72920'>And we furthermore know that this
  block here</span> <span m='76380'>is fixed to the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m='78380'>And we can choose a coordinate system origin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='82700'>Let's say we do that here.</span> </p><p><span m='84750'>We know
  that we have the distance d here</span> <span m='91720'>to this little
  block.</span> </p><p><span m='93750'>The moving parts, block 1 and block
  2--</span> <span m='96870'>so we have to assign position functions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='100160'>And actually this one here is x1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='106440'>It goes up to here because we want</span> <span m='109491'>to
  measure the string length, ultimately,</span> <span m='111200'>and we know
  this portion here.</span> </p><p><span m='113180'>So we can subtract
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='114560'>And then of course we need also x1, so that
  goes here-- x2.</span> </p><p><span m='124750'>So now we can tally up the
  length.</span> </p><p><span m='129490'>Let's start with this portion
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='132050'>That is d minus sa minus x2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='138186'>d minus sa minus x2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='144560'>And then we have a half circle here, pi r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='149040'>And we know actually that there is another half circle
  that's</span> <span m='152130'>going to come there, so we can just write 2 pi
  r immediately.</span> </p><p><span m='156840'>And then we have this part
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='159329'>That one is x1 minus sb, and then minus
  sa minus x2.</span> </p><p><span m='174730'>And then finally we have this
  portion,</span> <span m='177100'>and that is x1 minus sb minus x2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='190878'>OK, so the next step is that we need</span> <span
  m='192930'>to simplify this a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='195540'>So we
  have one x1 and another one here, 2x1 plus x2, x2,</span> <span
  m='207400'>x2-- actually 3-- minus 3x2.</span> </p><p><span m='214320'>And
  then we have all sorts of consonants.</span> </p><p><span m='217260'>We have
  d, we have sa, sb, the 2 pi r.</span> </p><p><span m='220990'>But, as you will
  see, if we differentiate this out here,</span> <span m='224780'>that will
  actually all fall away.</span> </p><p><span m='226260'>So we're going to make
  our life easy and just</span> <span m='228790'>add a constant here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='232920'>And so we want to now do the second derivative
  here</span> <span m='239160'>of our string length with respect to time,</span>
  <span m='242960'>because these all position functions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='245060'>So we can differentiate those.</span> </p><p><span
  m='247730'>What's important of course here is this string length</span> <span
  m='250640'>is not changing with time.</span> </p><p><span m='252570'>So
  actually we know that that derivative will be 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='256410'>And we can just write this up here</span> <span m='258410'>because
  x differentiated twice is a.</span> </p><p><span m='261440'>So 2a1 minus
  3a2.</span> </p><p><span m='267070'>And we immediately see from that that a1
  equals 3/2 a2.</span> </p><p><span m='279950'>So this is our constraint
  condition</span> <span m='282010'>that we will need later.</span> </p><p><span
  m='284820'>For now, we need to continue with setting up free body</span> <span
  m='289610'>diagrams of all four objects.</span> </p><p><span m='293820'>Let's
  start that with object 1.</span> </p><p><span m='298950'>What's acting on
  object 1?</span> </p><p><span m='301140'>Well, we have F here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='304745'>Why don't we just write it as magnitude.</span>
  </p><p><span m='308380'>We have F, and then we have here a tension</span>
  <span m='312740'>that goes to the pulley B. That one</span> <span
  m='316640'>is different from the tension in the string.</span> </p><p><span
  m='318780'>So we're going to call this TB.</span> </p><p><span m='321675'>And
  then we have object 2.</span> </p><p><span m='325520'>Oh, and of course, i hat
  goes in this direction</span> <span m='329560'>because it follows the motion
  of the object.</span> </p><p><span m='332840'>We have here kind of the
  reverse.</span> </p><p><span m='336000'>Now we have a tension of this string
  here</span> <span m='339860'>that's attached to pulley A, but it's</span>
  <span m='342239'>different from this string tension-- that's</span> <span
  m='344030'>a specific one-- TA.</span> </p><p><span m='346340'>And we also
  have a T from the string here.</span> </p><p><span m='351510'>So we'll add a
  T. And then if we look at pulley A,</span> <span m='358480'>we have two string
  tensions, T and T.</span> </p><p><span m='364360'>And here we again have a
  TA.</span> </p><p><span m='368830'>And pulley B, TB, and two T over
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='381020'>So that means we can write down our
  equations of motions</span> <span m='384460'>using Newton's Second Law, F
  equals ma.</span> </p><p><span m='392580'>And since this is just going in the
  i hat direction,</span> <span m='395800'>we can just write down the four
  equations following the four</span> <span m='399000'>free body diagrams
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='400870'>So we have F minus TB equals m1
  a1.</span> </p><p><span m='413340'>We have T plus TA equals m2 a2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='426820'>Then we have 2T minus TA equals 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='434280'>That is 0 because we're dealing with two massless pulleys</span>
  <span m='438560'>there.</span> </p><p><span m='439160'>That means m is 0 and
  so our acceleration term is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='444510'>So the m is 0
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='446880'>And finally, we have TB minus 2T.</span>
  </p><p><span m='451518'>No, not 2 pi-- 2T.</span> </p><p><span m='455409'>And
  that one is also 0 because it is a massless pulley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='459760'>So here we have our four equations of motion</span> <span
  m='463720'>that fully govern this pulley system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='467930'>And we can use it then, for example,</span> <span m='470780'>to
  find this pulling force here.</span> </p><p><span m='473930'>We know what TB
  is from the equation down here-- so 2T.</span> </p><p><span m='478830'>We know
  what TA is.</span> </p><p><span m='480410'>It's also 2T.</span> </p><p><span
  m='483090'>And we can then solve this for F.</span> </p><p><span
  m='486570'>The only sticky part is that we have this a1 and a2 in here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='492720'>But for that, we derived this constraint condition
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='497350'>So with that one, we can fully solve
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='501470'>Otherwise, we would have one too many
  unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='505030'>Alternatively, if one were to be
  interested in one</span> <span m='507850'>of these accelerations, then this
  equation system</span> <span m='513169'>can also be solved for a1 or
  a2.</span> </p>
