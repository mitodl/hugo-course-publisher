  <p><span m='3250'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='3810'>Well, I like to lay in the
  hammock in the summer.</span> </p><p><span m='6520'>And this is our version of
  that hammock.</span> </p><p><span m='9920'>So we're having one rope, or
  perhaps two ropes,</span> <span m='13240'>hanging between two trees
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='15900'>And they span an angle theta on each side
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='21700'>And we want to know what is the tension in
  this rope</span> <span m='25440'>at the midpoint and here, right where</span>
  <span m='28740'>it is attached to the tree.</span> </p><p><span m='31570'>And
  here we already have the free-body diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='35160'>I
  just drew this piece of the rope here</span> <span m='37970'>that's hanging on
  this tree here.</span> </p><p><span m='41550'>And we made an imaginary
  cut.</span> </p><p><span m='43790'>We just cut it in the middle, which</span>
  <span m='45850'>means gravity is obviously acting on it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='48520'>It's hanging through.</span> </p><p><span m='50870'>But it does so
  with m/2 here for our half rope.</span> </p><p><span m='56420'>We know that
  there is a tension here at the midpoint, Tmid.</span> </p><p><span
  m='60745'>And up here, we have a tension at that end point</span> <span
  m='64970'>that goes under this angle here.</span> </p><p><span m='69640'>I
  just use an ordinary Cartesian coordinate system</span> <span m='73130'>with
  the i-hat direction going in the x direction and j-hat</span> <span
  m='76460'>going in the y direction.</span> </p><p><span m='78680'>So all we
  need to do is we need to apply Newton's second law</span> <span m='82100'>and
  do an F equals ma analysis to figure out</span> <span m='86810'>what these
  tensions are.</span> </p><p><span m='89440'>So let's apply Newton's second
  law,</span> <span m='92229'>the F equals ma analysis, to figure out</span>
  <span m='94440'>what the tensions are at the midpoint</span> <span
  m='96420'>and at the end over there.</span> </p><p><span m='98900'>So we have
  F equals ma.</span> </p><p><span m='106120'>And we'll have to very carefully
  separate the components here.</span> </p><p><span m='111560'>Let's start with
  i-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='115298'>We have Tmid minus Tend, but of course
  we</span> <span m='125160'>have only the projection of Tend,</span> <span
  m='127530'>so this is Tend sine theta.</span> </p><p><span m='130400'>And
  since this rope is just hanging there,</span> <span m='133480'>the
  acceleration is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='135890'>In the j-hat direction, we
  have minus m/2 g and then plus Tend.</span> </p><p><span m='149100'>And here
  we have the cos theta component, and that is also 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='156370'>So we see from here pretty much immediately</span> <span
  m='161120'>that Tend equals m/2 g over cos theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='180170'>And we can stick this one here into the i-hat equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='185130'>So we'll get Tmid equals m/2 cos theta g sine
  theta.</span> </p><p><span m='202030'>And that's nothing else but mg/2 over 2
  tangent theta.</span> </p><p></p>
