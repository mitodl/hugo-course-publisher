  <p><span m='3320'>We are now in position to find the accelerations a1,
  a2,</span> <span m='6640'>and the tension, because we have Newton's second
  law</span> <span m='10580'>and our constraint condition for the
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='12970'>Let's recall the equations that we
  found.</span> </p><p><span m='15340'>We had m1g minus t was m1a1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20530'>And we had m2g minus 2t was equal to m2a2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='26660'>And we also had the condition-- constraint
  condition</span> <span m='29160'>between the accelerations that a1 was minus
  2a2.</span> </p><p><span m='34910'>So now we have a system of three
  equations.</span> </p><p><span m='38310'>And we can find-- we can solve for
  any of these quantities</span> <span m='41620'>that we want.</span>
  </p><p><span m='42790'>So one way to do it is to identify an equation</span>
  <span m='46240'>and to identify a quantity that we would like to solve
  for.</span> </p><p><span m='49610'>So for instance, let's identify that
  we</span> <span m='51800'>want to solve for a1 first.</span> </p><p><span
  m='55630'>So how are we going to develop a strategy for that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='58110'>Well, I'll choose equation 1 as my backbone
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m='62390'>And I have an unknown t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='64550'>But in equation 2, that unknown t is appearing
  there,</span> <span m='68580'>but it's expressed in terms of a2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='71170'>And a2 , though, from equation 3 is expressed in terms
  of a1.</span> </p><p><span m='75920'>So my first step is to write equation--
  rewrite equation</span> <span m='80810'>2 as m2g minus 2t equals m2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='85500'>Now here I'm going to make the substitution,
  which</span> <span m='88080'>is minus a1 over 2, so we'll call that 2a.</span>
  </p><p><span m='93990'>And now I have equation 1 and equation 2a,</span> <span
  m='98670'>two unknowns t, and a1.</span> </p><p><span m='101300'>And what I
  can do is I can solve for either equation.</span> </p><p><span m='106150'>And
  I can make a choice what's easiest.</span> </p><p><span m='108020'>When I look
  at these equations, it's</span> <span m='109539'>easiest for me to identify
  what t is in terms of a1.</span> </p><p><span m='114259'>So I'll write m1g
  minus m1a1 is equal to t.</span> </p><p><span m='120240'>I'll call that
  equation 1a.</span> </p><p><span m='121943'>And now I can substitute that
  value of t into equation 2a.</span> </p><p><span m='126795'>And I get m2g
  minus 2 times m1g minus m1a1.</span> </p><p><span m='136920'>And that's equal
  to minus m2 over 2 times a1.</span> </p><p><span m='147260'>And now I'd like
  to collect my a1 terms.</span> </p><p><span m='151550'>And what I have over
  here-- let's</span> <span m='154600'>bring all the a1 terms to this
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='157390'>And I get m2g minus 2m1g.</span>
  </p><p><span m='162900'>I have a plus, so I'm going to bring that over to this
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='167430'>And I get equal to-- that's plus
  plus,</span> <span m='171504'>so I'll have two minus signs, and I'll</span>
  <span m='174260'>have 2m1 plus m2 over 2 a1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='183230'>And now I can solve for a1.</span> </p><p><span m='187290'>And what
  I get is I get 2m1g minus m2g.</span> </p><p><span m='195650'>And I want to
  divide through by this denominator.</span> </p><p><span m='201240'>And what I
  have downstairs is 2m1 plus m2 divided by 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='209579'>And that's my expression for a1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211930'>Once I have that expression for a1,</span> <span m='214360'>I can
  easily come back and find out what a2 is.</span> </p><p><span m='218420'>Or I
  can substitute it into the equation here for a1</span> <span m='222450'>and
  find out what the tension is.</span> </p><p><span m='224540'>And so I can now
  easily find my expressions for a2 and t.</span> </p><p><span m='235970'>But
  I'll leave that as an exercise.</span> </p><p></p>
