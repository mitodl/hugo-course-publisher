  <p><span m='3570'>Let's look at a typical application</span> <span m='5560'>of
  Newton's second law for a system of objects.</span> </p><p><span m='8570'>So
  what I want to consider is a system of pulleys and masses.</span> </p><p><span
  m='13000'>So I'll have a fixed surface here, a ceiling.</span> </p><p><span
  m='17670'>And from the ceiling, we'll hang a pulley, which</span> <span
  m='20770'>I'm going to call pulley A. And this pulley will</span> <span
  m='23970'>have a rope attached to it, wrapped around it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='28350'>And here we have object 1.</span> </p><p><span m='31090'>And the
  rope goes around the pulley.</span> </p><p><span m='34220'>And now it's going
  to go around another pulley B</span> <span m='40880'>and fixed to the
  ceiling.</span> </p><p><span m='44550'>So that's fixed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='46880'>And hanging from pulley B is another mass 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52200'>And our goal in applying Newton's second law</span> <span
  m='55060'>is to find the accelerations of objects 1 and 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='59180'>Now, how do we approach this?</span> </p><p><span m='61390'>Well,
  the first thing we have to do</span> <span m='63260'>is decide if we're going
  to apply Newton's second law, what</span> <span m='67000'>is the system that
  we'll apply it to?</span> </p><p><span m='69490'>And there's many different
  ways to choose a system.</span> </p><p><span m='72090'>When we look at this
  problem, we'll</span> <span m='74240'>have several different systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='76850'>So let's consider the ones that we're going to look
  at.</span> </p><p><span m='79710'>And the first one is very simple.</span>
  </p><p><span m='81360'>It will be block 1.</span> </p><p><span m='84640'>And
  the second system that we look at,</span> <span m='86440'>we'll call that AB
  is pulley A.</span> </p><p><span m='91470'>Now that brings us to an
  interesting question</span> <span m='93860'>about pulley B and block 2,
  because we could separately</span> <span m='98810'>look at pulley B, and we
  could separately consider block 2,</span> <span m='103210'>or we consider them
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='104979'>And I want to first consider
  separately pulley B</span> <span m='112840'>and block 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='115680'>Now in some ways when you're looking at a compound system,</span>
  <span m='120480'>and it has four objects, it makes sense</span> <span
  m='122600'>to apply Newton's second law to each object separately.</span>
  </p><p><span m='125720'>But we'll pay careful attention to the fact</span>
  <span m='128538'>that object 2 is connected to pulley B.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131760'>And eventually, we'll see that we</span> <span m='134030'>can
  combine these two things.</span> </p><p><span m='136560'>So the next step is
  once we have identified</span> <span m='139390'>our object is to draw a free
  body force diagrams for each</span> <span m='142430'>of the objects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='143530'>So in order to do that, let's start with object
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='147760'>And we want to consider the forces on object
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='152620'>Now that brings us to our first issue</span>
  <span m='154710'>about what types of assumptions we're making in our
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='158490'>For instance, we have a rope
  that's</span> <span m='160380'>wrapped around this pulley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='161730'>And we have two pulleys that in principle could be rotating.</span>
  </p><p><span m='165610'>But what we'd like to do to simplify our analysis--
  so</span> <span m='168920'>let's keep track of some assumptions here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='173070'>Our first assumption will be that the mass, MP, of
  pulley A</span> <span m='181615'>and the mass of pulley B are approximately
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='185740'>Now the reason for that is that we're
  not</span> <span m='188300'>going to consider any of the fact</span> <span
  m='189750'>that these objects have to be put into rotational motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='193410'>Later on in the course, we'll see that this will give
  us</span> <span m='196270'>a more complicated analysis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='199150'>We're also going to assume that our rope is not slipping.</span>
  </p><p><span m='202420'>So the rope is actually is just slipping on the
  pulleys.</span> </p><p><span m='208650'>So what that means is it's just the
  rope is</span> <span m='211050'>sliding as the objects move.</span>
  </p><p><span m='214320'>Now again, what this is going to imply</span> <span
  m='217910'>is that the tension in the rope-- this rope</span> <span
  m='221430'>is also slipping.</span> </p><p><span m='223329'>And the rope is
  massless as well.</span> </p><p><span m='228000'>It's very light rope.</span>
  </p><p><span m='229380'>And all of these assumptions we've</span> <span
  m='230970'>seen when we analyze ropes tell us</span> <span m='234140'>that the
  tension T is uniform in the rope.</span> </p><p><span m='239850'>So that's our
  first assumption.</span> </p><p><span m='242000'>And we need to think about
  this before we even</span> <span m='244280'>begin to think about the forces on
  the object.</span> </p><p><span m='246490'>And now we can draw our
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='248480'>What do we have?</span> </p><p><span
  m='249690'>We have the gravitational force on object 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='252370'>And now we can identify the tension pulling in the string,</span>
  <span m='256519'>pulling object 1 up.</span> </p><p><span m='258579'>Now for
  every time we introduce a free body diagram,</span> <span m='262430'>recall
  that we have to choose what</span> <span m='265040'>we mean by positive
  directions.</span> </p><p><span m='267550'>And in this case, I'm going to pick
  a unit vector down, j hat</span> <span m='271800'>1 down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='273310'>So that's my positive direction for force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='276612'>Now before I write down all of Newton's laws,</span> <span
  m='280180'>I'll just write down our various force diagrams.</span>
  </p><p><span m='284540'>So for pulley A, I have two strings</span> <span
  m='290300'>that are pulling it downwards.</span> </p><p><span m='292370'>So I
  have tension and tension.</span> </p><p><span m='296380'>And this string, I'm
  going to call that T2,</span> <span m='300110'>is holding that pulley
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='304140'>So we have the force diagram.</span>
  </p><p><span m='307160'>Now I could write MAG, but we've assumed</span> <span
  m='310420'>that the pulley is massless.</span> </p><p><span m='312920'>And
  again, I'll call j hat A down.</span> </p><p><span m='317250'>For object 2,
  let's do pulley B first.</span> </p><p><span m='322480'>Now what are the
  forces on pulley B?</span> </p><p><span m='324596'>I have strings on both
  sides, T. Pulley B is massless,</span> <span m='329980'>so I'm not putting
  gravitational force.</span> </p><p><span m='333916'>And this string is pulling
  B downwards, so that's T3.</span> </p><p><span m='339100'>And again, we'll
  write j hat B downwards.</span> </p><p><span m='344110'>And finally, I have
  block 2.</span> </p><p><span m='347180'>So I'll draw that over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='350850'>I'll write block 2.</span> </p><p><span m='353230'>In
  fact, let's say a little space here.</span> </p><p><span m='357170'>We'll have
  j hat B downwards.</span> </p><p><span m='359750'>Now block 2, what do we have
  there?</span> </p><p><span m='362430'>We have the string pulling up block
  2,</span> <span m='364770'>which we've identified as T3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='368760'>And we have the gravitational force on block 2</span> <span
  m='371670'>downward, M2 g.</span> </p><p><span m='374450'>And there we have j
  had 2.</span> </p><p><span m='377220'>So I've now drawn the free body diagram
  of the various objects.</span> </p><p><span m='381400'>And that enables me to
  apply Newton's second law</span> <span m='384460'>for each of these
  objects.</span> </p><p><span m='386410'>So let's begin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='387520'>We'll start with object 1.</span> </p><p><span m='389720'>We have--
  remember in all cases, we're going to apply F</span> <span m='393920'>equals m
  a.</span> </p><p><span m='395880'>So for object 1, we have m1g positive
  downward minus</span> <span m='401860'>T is equal to m1 a1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='406140'>And that's our F equals m a on object 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='411110'>So sometimes we'll distinguish that the</span> <span
  m='414330'>forces we're getting from our free body diagram.</span>
  </p><p><span m='417140'>And A is a mathematical description of the
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='421080'>For block 2, we have m2g minus T3 is
  equal to m2 a2.</span> </p><p><span m='429740'>And now for pulley A, we have
  2T pointing downwards</span> <span m='438590'>minus T2 going upwards.</span>
  </p><p><span m='441770'>And because pulley A is massless,</span> <span
  m='445350'>this is zero even though pulley A may</span> <span m='449670'>be--
  it's actually fixed too.</span> </p><p><span m='452880'>So it's not even
  accelerating.</span> </p><p><span m='454310'>And what we see here is this
  equation--</span> <span m='456930'>I'm going to quickly note that it tells
  us</span> <span m='459510'>that the string holding pulley 2 up, T2, is equal
  to 2T.</span> </p><p><span m='467270'>So we can think of if, we want to know
  what</span> <span m='469890'>T2 is, we need to calculate T.</span>
  </p><p><span m='472330'>And finally we have B. And what is the forces on
  B?</span> </p><p><span m='478495'>We have T3 minus 2T.</span> </p><p><span
  m='483150'>And again pulley B is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='486260'>And so we
  see that T3 is equal to 2T.</span> </p><p><span m='492400'>Now if you think
  about what I said before about combining</span> <span m='497880'>systems, if
  we combine pulley B in block 2,</span> <span m='502610'>visually what we're
  doing is we're just adding these</span> <span m='505420'>to free body diagram
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='507640'>When we have a system B and block
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='513400'>Let's call this j hat downwards.</span>
  </p><p><span m='516640'>And when we add these free body diagram
  together,</span> <span m='519570'>you see that the T3 is now internal force to
  the system.</span> </p><p><span m='523940'>It cancels in pair by Newton's
  second law.</span> </p><p><span m='527080'>And all we have is the two strings
  going up,</span> <span m='530760'>so we have T and T. And we have the
  gravitational force</span> <span m='535740'>downward.</span> </p><p><span
  m='537180'>And separately, when we saw that T3 equals 2T</span> <span
  m='542950'>and we apply it there, then if we consider a system B2,</span>
  <span m='550420'>and look at our free body diagram, we have m2g minus
  2T--</span> <span m='556680'>and notice we have the same result their 2T
  equals m2 a2.</span> </p><p><span m='563330'>So in principle now-- and I'll
  outline our equations.</span> </p><p><span m='566820'>We have equation
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='570080'>We have equation 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='573030'>And in these two equations, we have three unknowns, T, A1,</span>
  <span m='578410'>and A2, but only two equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='581314'>And so you might think, what about</span> <span m='582730'>this
  missing third equation here?</span> </p><p><span m='585300'>However, in this
  equation, we have a fourth unknown, T3.</span> </p><p><span m='589260'>And
  this equation is just relating to T and T3.</span> </p><p><span m='593760'>So
  in principle, we would have four unknowns</span> <span m='595800'>and three
  equations.</span> </p><p><span m='596980'>Or if we restrict our attention to
  these two equations,</span> <span m='600540'>we have three unknowns and two
  equations.</span> </p><p><span m='605080'>Are unknowns T, A1 and A2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='611040'>These are our unknowns.</span> </p><p><span
  m='612910'>And now our next step is to try to figure out</span> <span
  m='616030'>what is the missing condition that's relating</span> <span
  m='619800'>the sum of these unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='621600'>And that
  will be a constraint condition</span> <span m='623730'>that we'll analyze
  next.</span> </p>
