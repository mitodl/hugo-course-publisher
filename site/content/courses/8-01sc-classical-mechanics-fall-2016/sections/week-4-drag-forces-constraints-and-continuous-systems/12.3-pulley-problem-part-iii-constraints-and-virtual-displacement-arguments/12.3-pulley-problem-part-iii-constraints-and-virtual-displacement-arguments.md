title: '12.3 Pulley Problem - Part III, Constraints and Virtual Displacement Arguments'
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3640'>When we did our analytic analysis of the constraint</span>
  <span m='6730'>conditions between the accelerations of objects 1</span> <span
  m='9010'>and 2, we came up with the condition</span> <span m='11200'>that a1
  was equal to minus 2 a2.</span> </p><p><span m='13980'>Now let's do something
  which we call a virtual displacement</span> <span m='16880'>argument.</span>
  </p><p><span m='17610'>Suppose that b and 2 move down a certain amount.</span>
  </p><p><span m='22410'>Let's imagine-- and I'm going to draw in a different
  color,</span> <span m='25580'>too-- so we have object 2, and pulley 2 has
  moved down.</span> </p><p><span m='31280'>Now, this object has displaced by
  distance delta</span> <span m='35350'>y 2, which is also equal to delta
  y</span> <span m='38900'>b because they're connected.</span> </p><p><span
  m='40980'>Now, what happens when the system does that,</span> <span
  m='45020'>is our rope has to extend downwards around this pulley</span> <span
  m='52640'>and come back up.</span> </p><p><span m='54140'>And that means that
  the rope that object 1</span> <span m='56860'>has been foreshortened by not
  just delta y2,</span> <span m='60830'>but on both sides, delta y2 and delta
  y2,</span> <span m='66530'>object 1 has displaced up by that amount.</span>
  </p><p><span m='73289'>So we'll just make this so we can draw it</span> <span
  m='78635'>in a reasonable way.</span> </p><p><span m='80640'>So what we see
  here is that delta y1 is</span> <span m='85560'>equal to-- now notice, if 2
  goes down, by delta y2,</span> <span m='92660'>then delta y1-- which is this
  whole distance--</span> <span m='95600'>is a negative quantity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='97430'>And it's going upwards.</span> </p><p><span
  m='99090'>And so we see that that's minus 2 delta y2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='104150'>And if we took two derivatives-- or displacement</span> <span
  m='107850'>and then look at the change in displacement--</span> <span
  m='110370'>we would see that this implies that the acceleration of 1</span>
  <span m='114100'>is minus 2 a2.</span> </p><p><span m='117039'>But let's come
  back to our two conditions for length</span> <span m='120430'>and see the same
  thing here.</span> </p><p><span m='122400'>Because delta l2 is 0, this tells
  us</span> <span m='126540'>that delta y2 is equal to delta y d.</span>
  </p><p><span m='130470'>So we'll write minus equals 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='133100'>And that was our condition that the block and 2</span> <span
  m='136140'>were moving together.</span> </p><p><span m='137660'>And up here,
  we see that, because delta l1 is also 0,</span> <span m='144770'>this
  implies-- and now I'll make that substitution that delta</span> <span
  m='150220'>y b is equal to delta y2-- that 2 delta y2 here</span> <span
  m='157600'>and here plus delta y1 has to be 0 coming from that piece.</span>
  </p><p><span m='164579'>And so we see that delta y1 is minus 2 delta
  y2.</span> </p><p><span m='170260'>Which is what our virtual
  displacement</span> <span m='173310'>argument showed us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='174740'>And again, if you take two derivatives here,</span> <span
  m='180590'>we have that recall that, in the simplest way,</span> <span
  m='184770'>that the velocity is dy1 dt.</span> </p><p><span m='190840'>And the
  acceleration, a1, is d squared y1 dt squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='197579'>Then, this same proportionality is maintained</span> <span
  m='201550'>under the two derivatives.</span> </p><p><span m='203290'>And
  that's another way of thinking</span> <span m='205680'>about how to get the
  relationship</span> <span m='207420'>between the accelerations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='208870'>But you have to be extremely careful about that
  sign</span> <span m='212900'>because this 2 goes in the positive
  direction,</span> <span m='215579'>1 will go in the negative direction.</span>
