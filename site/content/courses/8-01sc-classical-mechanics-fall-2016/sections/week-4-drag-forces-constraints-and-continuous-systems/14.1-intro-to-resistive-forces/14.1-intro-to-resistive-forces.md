  <p><span m='3450'>We would now like to discuss drag forces in a fluid.</span>
  </p><p><span m='8360'>Now remember that fluids can be both a liquid or
  air.</span> </p><p><span m='13660'>And drag forces are actually quite
  complicated</span> <span m='16010'>depending on a lot of factors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18290'>If we had an object falling in a fluid,</span> <span
  m='21210'>the drag forces can depend on both the properties</span> <span
  m='24400'>of the object-- and in that case,</span> <span m='29780'>it might be
  the speed or the size</span> <span m='34190'>or the shape of the object-- and
  it also</span> <span m='36860'>can depend on the properties of the
  fluid.</span> </p><p><span m='38980'>It can depend on the density of the
  fluid.</span> </p><p><span m='42210'>It can depend on a property that
  measures</span> <span m='44690'>the resistance of a fluid, something</span>
  <span m='46410'>which we'll refer to as viscosity,</span> <span m='49060'>and
  also a property about the compressibility of a fluid.</span> </p><p><span
  m='53290'>So in general, this is quite complicated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='58120'>And this is done empirically.</span> </p><p><span m='59950'>There's
  a few very special cases that we'll discuss</span> <span m='62140'>that can be
  solved exactly.</span> </p><p><span m='64739'>Now let's begin our modeling by
  considering</span> <span m='68070'>what we call air drag.</span> </p><p><span
  m='71430'>Now in air drag, objects that are moving--</span> <span
  m='74750'>and we'll consider objects that are moving rapidly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='80270'>So our objects are moving very fast.</span>
  </p><p><span m='83680'>Now in that case, we can model-- make a rough
  model</span> <span m='87680'>of the air drag as follows.</span> </p><p><span
  m='90480'>The magnitude of this force is going</span> <span m='94140'>to be
  proportional to the speed squared.</span> </p><p><span m='98140'>There'll be a
  factor where it's the cross-sectional area</span> <span m='103180'>that the
  object presents in the motion, perpendicular</span> <span m='107090'>to the
  plane of motion.</span> </p><p><span m='109070'>It can depend on the density
  of the air.</span> </p><p><span m='113021'>And traditionally there are a
  couple of coefficients in here</span> <span m='115520'>that are dimensionless
  that are empirically determined</span> <span m='118450'>by the shape of the
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='120130'>And that's called the drag
  coefficient.</span> </p><p><span m='122870'>And in fact, there's also a factor
  1/2 in the way</span> <span m='126090'>this law is traditionally
  written.</span> </p><p><span m='128110'>So what we have here is a resistive
  force which</span> <span m='132590'>is proportional to the speed squared and
  depends</span> <span m='136050'>on the properties of the air, the density of
  the air,</span> <span m='140800'>and some physical parameters-- properties of
  the object</span> <span m='144160'>itself.</span> </p><p><span m='145410'>Now
  this drag coefficient-- we can have a table that</span> <span m='149570'>can
  represent that.</span> </p><p><span m='150829'>And you can see here that for a
  variety of different shapes,</span> <span m='154710'>the drag coefficient is
  somewhere on the order of 1.</span> </p><p><span m='160110'>So this is an
  example of what we refer to as air drag.</span> </p><p><span m='167200'>When
  we drop objects in a fluid at very slow speeds,</span> <span m='170800'>we
  have a different effect than what we talked about air drag.</span>
  </p><p><span m='174530'>For example, if we drop a marble in molasses</span>
  <span m='177030'>and drop the same marble in water,</span> <span m='178840'>we
  see a very different motion.</span> </p><p><span m='181130'>And that depends
  on a property of the fluid which</span> <span m='183200'>we'll refer to as
  viscosity.</span> </p><p><span m='187330'>Now we'll denote a coefficient of
  viscosity</span> <span m='191260'>by the symbol n, eta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='194430'>Now when we drop an object in a fluid,</span> <span m='198500'>that
  the drag force in magnitude will be proportional</span> <span m='206150'>to
  both viscosity-- will be proportional to the speed</span> <span m='210660'>and
  it will be proportional to the viscosity.</span> </p><p><span m='214400'>And
  now, for various special cases,</span> <span m='218220'>so for the special
  case which is a sphere of radius r,</span> <span m='226500'>if you study fluid
  dynamics, we can get an exact solution</span> <span m='231200'>for this drag
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='233070'>And we'll describe that as-- it's</span>
  <span m='237350'>going to be opposite the direction of the velocity,</span>
  <span m='240420'>so there's a minus sign.</span> </p><p><span m='242420'>There
  turns out to be some coefficients-- 6 pi</span> <span m='246330'>times the
  viscosity of the fluid times the radius of the sphere.</span> </p><p><span
  m='253030'>And this particular law, which we'll known as Stokes' law,</span>
  <span m='258940'>is exactly applicable to the motion of a sphere.</span>
  </p><p><span m='264040'>Now in fact, by experimental measurement,</span> <span
  m='267280'>this is a method for determining eta experimentally</span> <span
  m='271420'>by dropping objects-- spheres-- in various different media</span>
  <span m='275646'>with different viscosities.</span> </p><p><span m='276770'>So
  we can use this to experimentally determine</span> <span m='278790'>the
  viscosity of the medium.</span> </p><p><span m='280570'>And what's important
  to realize, too,</span> <span m='283040'>is that this is applicable to many
  different examples.</span> </p>
