transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3650'>So when we analyzed Newton's Second Law-- applied</span>
  <span m='5970'>to this compound system-- we had two equations</span> <span
  m='8650'>for Object 1 and Object 2.</span> </p><p><span m='13369'>And what we
  found is that we had three unknowns--</span> <span m='15410'>the tension in
  the string and the accelerations of the two</span> <span
  m='18070'>objects.</span> </p><p><span m='18830'>Now, how do we solve this
  system?</span> </p><p><span m='21590'>Well, we're missing one condition,
  which</span> <span m='23540'>is a constraint condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='24960'>Which is, as Object 2 moves and Object 1 moves,</span> <span
  m='28310'>they have to move in some relationship together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='31060'>And now what we'd like to do is show</span> <span m='32560'>an
  analytic approach for finding that constraint condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='36470'>And the way we think about it is that,</span> <span m='39270'>we'll
  call l equal to the length of the string,</span> <span m='43870'>and this
  quantity is a constant.</span> </p><p><span m='48540'>And what we'd like to do
  is introduce</span> <span m='50510'>coordinate functions for our Object 1 and
  our Object</span> <span m='53520'>2 and express l in terms of those coordinate
  functions.</span> </p><p><span m='57170'>And then, take two derivatives of l,
  set that equal to 0</span> <span m='61190'>because it's a constant, and
  that</span> <span m='63020'>will give us a relationship between the
  accelerations</span> <span m='65710'>of Objects 1 and 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='67420'>Now, this is a little bit tricky.</span> </p><p><span m='68900'>And
  so, what we want to do is, very carefully,</span> <span m='71220'>show how we
  introduce coordinate functions.</span> </p><p><span m='73800'>Recall that we
  had j hat 1 down and j hat 2 downwards.</span> </p><p><span m='80390'>What
  that implies is that we're choosing some origin</span> <span m='84110'>and
  we're-- let's choose an origin up here--</span> <span m='87650'>and for a
  coordinate function for Object 1,</span> <span m='90240'>it has to be
  consistent with our choice of what we mean by j hat</span> <span
  m='94771'>1.</span> </p><p><span m='95380'>So, in this sense, y1 is a positive
  quantity</span> <span m='99610'>when we're going downward.</span> </p><p><span
  m='102940'>Now, what about coordinate functions</span> <span m='105110'>for
  the other objects in the system?</span> </p><p><span m='107229'>Well, let's
  look at a few things first.</span> </p><p><span m='111020'>This is a fixed
  distance-- we'll call</span> <span m='113020'>it s1-- between the ceiling and
  the center of the pulley.</span> </p><p><span m='121760'>And let's make each
  of the pulleys a radius, r.</span> </p><p><span m='126160'>And let's call this
  a function y b.</span> </p><p><span m='132540'>And let's make this y2 of
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='137070'>So now we have coordinate functions for
  2</span> <span m='139470'>and coordinate functions for 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='141120'>And again, recall that this distance here-- s2--</span> <span
  m='146100'>is a fixed distance.</span> </p><p><span m='148870'>And when we
  define these coordinate functions</span> <span m='151600'>in this fashion, we
  know that the second derivative-- d</span> <span m='155650'>squared y1 dt
  squared-- this is precisely what we</span> <span m='161100'>mean by the
  acceleration of Object 1.</span> </p><p><span m='164510'>And in the similar
  fashion, d squared</span> <span m='166430'>y2 dt squared is what we mean by
  the acceleration of Object 2.</span> </p><p><span m='173130'>So we've
  introduced a coordinate system,</span> <span m='175040'>we've made it very
  clear what we mean by the accelerations of a1</span> <span m='178540'>and a2,
  and now let's look at our constraint condition</span> <span m='182460'>that
  the length of the string is constant.</span> </p><p><span m='185090'>So what
  we're going to do is try to see</span> <span m='187510'>if we can express the
  length of this string in terms of all</span> <span m='192190'>the coordinate
  functions and some</span> <span m='194060'>of these ancillary
  quantities.</span> </p><p><span m='196660'>So what we have here is that the
  length of the string</span> <span m='202160'>is y b going down here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='206820'>So the length of the string has a factor y b.</span>
  </p><p><span m='210980'>It wraps around Pulley b-- so that's pi R--</span>
  <span m='216750'>and it goes up to this length here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='220720'>Now, this length is y b minus s1.</span> </p><p><span m='226520'>So
  that's y b minus s1.</span> </p><p><span m='231290'>We wrap around the pulley
  again-- that's pi R.</span> </p><p><span m='236420'>And now, we have this
  length here, which is y1 minus s1.</span> </p><p><span m='245880'>s1?</span>
  </p><p><span m='247910'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='249140'>And let's just
  make sure we have all of our quantities here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='253120'>Now, we also have another constraint condition,</span> <span
  m='257230'>that this length of the string-- we're</span> <span
  m='260790'>going to call this l1-- we have a second string here, l2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='267760'>And l2 is given by y2-- this length is y2 minus y
  b--</span> <span m='278770'>and that was what we called this constant,
  s2.</span> </p><p><span m='282710'>So we now have two string lengths-- l2
  equals y2 minus y</span> <span m='288972'>b-- and both of these string lengths
  are constant.</span> </p><p><span m='294070'>And we have the following
  facts.</span> </p><p><span m='295990'>Let's start with this one first, that
  the second derivative</span> <span m='299460'>of l2 dt squared-- because the
  length of the string</span> <span m='302830'>is a constant, that's 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='305620'>And that tells us, two derivatives of this</span>
  <span m='308810'>is a2 and two derivatives of that is a b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='313540'>And this is something that we saw before, that block b and 2</span>
  <span m='318270'>are moving together.</span> </p><p><span m='320290'>So when
  we treated the system as just b and 2 together,</span> <span m='323620'>we see
  that the acceleration of 2</span> <span m='325920'>and the acceleration of
  Pulley b are the same.</span> </p><p><span m='328520'>So we could have just
  said that before we began.</span> </p><p><span m='332200'>Now, let's put these
  equations aside for the moment.</span> </p><p><span m='338530'>And now let's
  consider taking two derivatives of String 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='347900'>Recall, String 1 is this object here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='351960'>We'll call this String 1 and this String 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='358970'>Now, again, if we take two derivatives-- let's</span> <span
  m='361600'>look at our expression first-- we</span> <span m='364590'>see that
  we have two factors of y b</span> <span m='366940'>and we have a bunch of
  constants whose derivative is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='369580'>So we don't
  have to worry about the wrap around distances--</span> <span m='372850'>the pi
  R's-- we don't have to worry about the constants-- s1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='377150'>All we have to think about is which quantities</span> <span
  m='379140'>are changing in time.</span> </p><p><span m='380540'>So we have 2 a
  b when we take two derivatives</span> <span m='385130'>and we have one factor
  of a1-- and that's 0.</span> </p><p><span m='389650'>And now, because the
  block and 2 and Pulley b</span> <span m='395450'>are accelerating together, we
  have our condition,</span> <span m='398820'>which is 2 a2 plus a1 is 0-- or
  that a1 is equal to minus 2 a2.</span> </p><p><span m='408590'>And that is the
  extra constraint condition</span> <span m='413180'>that will enable us to
  solve the system of equations.</span> </p><p></p>
