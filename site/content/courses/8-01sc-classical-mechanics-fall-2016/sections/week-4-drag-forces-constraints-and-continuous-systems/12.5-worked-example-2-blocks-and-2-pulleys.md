![A diagram of two blocks connected by a rope passing through two pulleys.](https://open-learning-course-data-ci.s3.amazonaws.com/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/794933447d4b58e6d2e65df140bc0204_jsinput_freebodydraw_blocks_connected_by_moveable_pulleys_setup.svg)

Blocks 1 and 2 lie on a frictionless surface and are connected by three massless ropes strung over massless, frictionless pulleys as shown above. A force of magnitude \\(F\\) is applied to Block 1.

**(Part a)** Draw free-body diagrams for block 1 and block 2 as they move accross the table.

**(Part b)** Draw free-body diagrams for the right and the left pulley.
