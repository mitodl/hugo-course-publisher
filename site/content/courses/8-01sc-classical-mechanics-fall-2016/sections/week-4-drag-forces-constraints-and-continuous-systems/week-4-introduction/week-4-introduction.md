title: Week 4 Introduction
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='499'>This week, we will examine some more advanced topics</span>
  <span m='3170'>in the application of Newton's laws of motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5970'>First, we will look at more examples of constrained
  motion,</span> <span m='9700'>where the motion is forced to obey</span> <span
  m='11280'>some particular condition in addition</span> <span m='13520'>to
  Newton's laws of motion.</span> </p><p><span m='15370'>These conditions
  usually specify some particular relationship</span> <span m='18980'>between
  coordinates of objects and the system we are studying.</span> </p><p><span
  m='22380'>Specifically, we will re-examine the case</span> <span m='24960'>of
  objects suspended with pulleys and ropes,</span> <span m='27700'>but with more
  complex systems than we</span> <span m='29480'>have discussed
  previously.</span> </p><p><span m='31480'>The fact that the ropes have fixed
  length</span> <span m='33620'>will provide a constraint condition</span> <span
  m='35240'>relating the coordinates of our various masses.</span> </p><p><span
  m='38890'>Second, we will examine the case of forces</span> <span
  m='42140'>acting on a continuous, extended mass distribution as opposed</span>
  <span m='46280'>to acting on discrete point masses.</span> </p><p><span
  m='48780'>This will allow us to introduce a powerful differential</span> <span
  m='52240'>analysis technique from calculus where we model continuous
  mass</span> <span m='56500'>distributions as made up of lots of small,
  discrete mass</span> <span m='60480'>elements and then examine the limiting
  case</span> <span m='63240'>of infinitesimally small elements</span> <span
  m='65620'>to obtain the continuous behavior.</span> </p><p><span
  m='67835'>This is a technique that you will</span> <span m='69210'>see applied
  over and over again in physics and engineering.</span> </p><p><span
  m='72390'>And in fact, we will return to it again later in this course.</span>
  </p><p><span m='76700'>Our specific example will be to study how
  tension</span> <span m='79890'>varies in a long, massive rope.</span>
  </p><p><span m='82440'>This is in contrast to the light,</span> <span
  m='84140'>effectively massless ropes that we discussed previously.</span>
  </p><p><span m='88320'>Finally, we will discuss velocity-dependent
  forces--</span> <span m='92250'>that is, forces whose strength depends on the
  velocity</span> <span m='95759'>or some function of the velocity of the mass
  being acted on.</span> </p><p><span m='99890'>The most common example of this
  is resistive forces or drag</span> <span m='103300'>forces, which are caused
  by motion of a solid object</span> <span m='106570'>through a fluid, like air
  or water.</span> </p><p><span m='109390'>That is the example we will discuss
  this week.</span> </p><p><span m='111770'>Another example you may be aware
  of</span> <span m='113820'>is the magnetic force that acts on a charged
  particle, which</span> <span m='116880'>depends upon the velocity of the
  charged particle.</span> </p><p><span m='120390'>In all three of these cases,
  we will simply</span> <span m='122860'>be applying Newton's three laws of
  motion,</span> <span m='126470'>but the situations will require a more
  sophisticated treatment</span> <span m='129240'>to what has come
  before.</span> </p><p></p>
