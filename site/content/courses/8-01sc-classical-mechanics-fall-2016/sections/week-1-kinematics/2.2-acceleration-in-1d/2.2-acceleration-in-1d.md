transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3450'>We've now described what we call the instantaneous
  velocity</span> <span m='7370'>at some time t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8930'>And we talked about it as a limit as delta t</span> <span
  m='11170'>goes to 0 of the displacement over the time, which</span> <span
  m='14070'>we wrote as the derivative of the position function</span> <span
  m='17560'>in terms of i-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='19780'>Now this
  derivative, we're going to use a notation.</span> </p><p><span m='22560'>We'll
  just write that as v of t i-hat, where v of t</span> <span m='27950'>is the
  component of the instantaneous velocity at time</span> <span
  m='32090'>t.</span> </p><p><span m='33150'>Now remember, this is just a
  symbol.</span> </p><p><span m='35840'>But we describe this as the
  derivative</span> <span m='38940'>of the position function, which I'll</span>
  <span m='40550'>indicate as a function of time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='42950'>And that's what we mean by the component</span> <span m='45700'>of
  the instantaneous velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='47690'>Now what we would
  like to do is ask ourselves,</span> <span m='49750'>how does the velocity
  change in time,</span> <span m='53270'>if the runner is increasing their
  velocity?</span> </p><p><span m='57130'>Well, in general, we'll do exactly
  what we did before.</span> </p><p><span m='60580'>What we'd like to introduce
  first</span> <span m='62760'>is the concept of the change in the
  velocity</span> <span m='67540'>delta v, which will describe as the velocity
  at time</span> <span m='72480'>t plus delta t minus the velocity at time
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='78830'>So what we have in here is the change-- the
  component</span> <span m='87030'>of the change of the velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='88690'>And this quantity is how the velocity</span> <span
  m='91590'>changed in into time interval between t and t plus delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='97539'>Remember, this is very specifically</span> <span
  m='100250'>for this time interval.</span> </p><p><span m='101870'>Now what we
  would like to do is take the same limiting process.</span> </p><p><span
  m='105450'>Let's take the limit as delta t goes</span> <span m='108340'>to 0
  of this change in velocity over time.</span> </p><p><span m='113490'>So we
  have the limit as delta t goes to 0</span> <span m='117039'>of delta v, delta
  t, i-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='120810'>And this quantity is what we
  call</span> <span m='124070'>the instantaneous acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='132040'>Now as before, what we're doing is</span> <span
  m='136030'>we're plotting the component of the velocity</span> <span
  m='139840'>as a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='141260'>Let's just
  say, again, that we have some unusual function.</span> </p><p><span
  m='145360'>I'll just draw it like this.</span> </p><p><span m='147670'>And
  here's the picture at time t.</span> </p><p><span m='151340'>Here is the
  picture at time t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='154970'>This change,
  delta v over delta t, this is v at t.</span> </p><p><span m='161620'>Up here,
  this is what we mean by-- let's just-- remember,</span> <span m='166700'>we're
  plotting the velocity as a function of time v of t</span> <span
  m='171930'>plus delta t and this quantity here,</span> <span m='176020'>which
  is delta v over delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='180700'>Again, we can even
  call as we said before, we can</span> <span m='183980'>call this average
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='188500'>But what we're interested in is
  that as we</span> <span m='190700'>take the limit as delta t goes to 0, then
  the slope changes.</span> </p><p><span m='198170'>You can see.</span>
  </p><p><span m='199579'>And we continue this limiting process,</span> <span
  m='202090'>until we shrink delta t down to 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='206079'>And that what we have here is this</span> <span m='211680'>is the
  slope of the tangent line.</span> </p><p><span m='220420'>And that's what we
  call the instantaneous acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='226420'>So if we
  want to use a notation, we</span> <span m='228600'>don't want to keep on
  writing limit delta t goes to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='232200'>So what we can
  write is a of t.</span> </p><p><span m='235660'>It has a component a of t
  i-hat and that component of a of t.</span> </p><p><span m='242430'>This is
  precisely the derivative of the velocity function</span> <span m='247180'>as a
  function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='250230'>And so now we've described
  the position vector, the velocity</span> <span m='254860'>vector, and the
  acceleration vector associated with motion.</span> </p><p></p>
