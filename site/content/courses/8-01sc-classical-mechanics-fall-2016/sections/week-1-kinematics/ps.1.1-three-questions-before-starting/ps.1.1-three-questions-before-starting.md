title: PS.1.1 Three Questions Before Starting
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3650'>I'd like to talk to you about solving</span> <span
  m='6150'>these kinematics problems.</span> </p><p><span m='7920'>So we're
  going to actually start by asking ourselves</span> <span m='10730'>three
  separate questions anytime we</span> <span m='13210'>start one of these
  kinematics problems</span> <span m='15276'>and this will help us really figure
  out</span> <span m='16900'>what's happening in the motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='19400'>So the first question that we want to ask</span> <span m='21330'>is,
  how many objects are moving?</span> </p><p><span m='23840'>So do we care about
  more than one object, and if we do,</span> <span m='27570'>we need to make
  sure to label each one distinctively.</span> </p><p><span m='30180'>We also
  want to know how many dimensions we need</span> <span m='32180'>to care about
  for each object.</span> </p><p><span m='35240'>The second question that we
  want to ask ourselves</span> <span m='37460'>is, how many stages of motion
  does each object have?</span> </p><p><span m='40980'>So for an example, if
  you're told</span> <span m='43110'>that a bicycle is initially
  accelerating</span> <span m='45530'>and then, at a certain time, it stops
  accelerating,</span> <span m='48110'>then you know that that initial
  acceleration</span> <span m='50470'>is going to have different equations of
  motion</span> <span m='52730'>than the point in time where it now has</span>
  <span m='54890'>an acceleration equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='58290'>The final thing that we want to think about,</span> <span
  m='60400'>we want to figure out what special conditions there are.</span>
  </p><p><span m='63720'>So for example, you might be told that the cart is
  initially</span> <span m='67910'>at rest.</span> </p><p><span m='68670'>So
  what does that mean in reality?</span> </p><p><span m='70600'>It means that
  you can write down something like, v of 0</span> <span m='75210'>is equal to
  0, that's what it means for the cart</span> <span m='78370'>to initially be at
  rest.</span> </p><p><span m='79780'>v cart is-- v at time 0 is equal to
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='85250'>So those are the kinds of special
  conditions</span> <span m='87310'>that you need to pay attention for in the
  problem</span> <span m='89560'>and that will help you figure out--</span>
  <span m='91520'>get all of the numbers or the variables</span> <span
  m='93900'>that you need to solve your equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='96270'>Once you're done thinking through these different steps,</span>
  <span m='98664'>the final thing you should always</span> <span m='100039'>do
  before starting a problem is draw out your problem,</span> <span
  m='105490'>properly label your system, and then of course</span> <span
  m='109360'>draw your origin, your axes, and your unit vectors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='116650'>And this way, it will be easy for you</span> <span
  m='118620'>to organize all of the different information that you have.</span>
