  <p><span m='4630'>Let's consider a one dimensional motion that</span> <span
  m='7040'>has a non-uniform acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='9910'>What
  we'd like to do is explore how</span> <span m='11530'>do you differentiate
  position functions,</span> <span m='13800'>to get velocity functions, to get
  acceleration functions.</span> </p><p><span m='17270'>So what we're going to
  consider is a rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='19230'>So I'm going to choose a
  coordinate system y.</span> </p><p><span m='21970'>And here's my
  rocket.</span> </p><p><span m='23350'>And I have a function y of t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='26380'>And I'll have a j-hat direction, but this will</span>
  <span m='29150'>be a one dimensional motion.</span> </p><p><span m='32000'>Now
  I want to express while the rocket is thrusting upwards</span> <span
  m='36280'>and the engine is burning, we can describe a function y of t</span>
  <span m='41100'>to be equal to 1/2 a constant a naught</span> <span
  m='45626'>minus the gravitational acceleration, times t squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49065'>And we're going to have a separate term here,
  which</span> <span m='51190'>is minus 1 over 30.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52950'>And you'll see where this 30 comes in</span> <span m='54540'>as we
  start to differentiate.</span> </p><p><span m='56210'>The same constant a
  naught, t to the 1/6 over t naught</span> <span m='61360'>to the 1/4.</span>
  </p><p><span m='62570'>Now in this expression, a naught is bigger than
  g.</span> </p><p><span m='66960'>And also, this is only true, this</span>
  <span m='69580'>holds for the time interval 0 less than</span> <span
  m='72870'>or equal to t, less than t naught.</span> </p><p><span m='76190'>And
  at time t equals to t naught, the engine shuts off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='85680'>And at that moment, our expectation</span> <span m='87610'>will be
  that the y component of the acceleration</span> <span m='90800'>should just be
  minus g, for t greater than t naught.</span> </p><p><span m='97759'>So now
  let's calculate the acceleration</span> <span m='101910'>as the velocity and
  the position as functions of time.</span> </p><p><span m='106030'>So the
  velocity-- in each case, we're</span> <span m='108020'>going to use the
  polynomial rule.</span> </p><p><span m='109810'>So the y component of the
  velocity</span> <span m='112180'>is just the derivative of t squared, which is
  just 2t.</span> </p><p><span m='116420'>And so we get a naught minus g times
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='120990'>And when we differentiate t at the 1/6, the
  6 over 30</span> <span m='125340'>gives us factor 1 over 5.</span>
  </p><p><span m='127090'>So we have minus 1 over 5 times a naught, t to the
  1/5</span> <span m='133620'>over t naught to the 1/4.</span> </p><p><span
  m='135960'>And this is a combination of a linear term and a term</span> <span
  m='139910'>that is decreasing by this t to the 1/5 factor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143260'>And finally, we now take the next derivative, ay of t,</span> <span
  m='147079'>which is d dy dt.</span> </p><p><span m='151100'>I'll just keep
  functions of t, but we don't really need that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='154160'>And when we differentiate here, we get a naught minus g.</span>
  </p><p><span m='158350'>Now you see the 5s are canceling,</span> <span
  m='160750'>and we have minus a naught t to the 1/4 over t naught</span> <span
  m='165350'>to the 1/4.</span> </p><p><span m='166840'>Now at time t equals t
  naught, what do we have?</span> </p><p><span m='172050'>Well, ay at t equals t
  naught.</span> </p><p><span m='176660'>This is just a factor minus a
  naught.</span> </p><p><span m='178460'>Those cancel, and we get minus g, which
  is what we expected.</span> </p><p><span m='183730'>Now this is a complicated
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='185860'>And let's see if we can make a
  graphical analysis</span> <span m='188960'>of this motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='189810'>So let's plot y as a function of t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='194580'>Now notice we have a quadratic term and a factor t</span> <span
  m='197720'>to the 1/6 with the minus sign.</span> </p><p><span m='199990'>So
  for small values of t, the quadratic term will dominate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='207280'>But as t gets larger, then the t to of the 1/5 term</span> <span
  m='213579'>will dominate.</span> </p><p><span m='214340'>That's t
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='216670'>And let's call t equal to t
  naught.</span> </p><p><span m='220270'>Now we have to be a little bit
  careful.</span> </p><p><span m='222710'>Because when the engine turns
  off,</span> <span m='224790'>the rocket is still moving upwards.</span>
  </p><p><span m='227070'>So even though it starts to grow like this,</span>
  <span m='230390'>it will start to still fall off a little bit,</span> <span
  m='235430'>due to this t to the 1/6 term.</span> </p><p><span m='237770'>It
  has a slope that is always positive.</span> </p><p><span m='244020'>So we're
  claiming that our velocity term is positive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='247450'>And then somewhere, if the engine completely</span> <span
  m='251740'>didn't turn off, this term would still--</span> <span
  m='257200'>where is the point where the velocity, the vertical velocity</span>
  <span m='260180'>is 0, because gravity will-- this term will eventually</span>
  <span m='263590'>dominate.</span> </p><p><span m='264870'>And that, we can
  see, is going to occur at some later time,</span> <span m='269260'>even though
  that's not part of our problem.</span> </p><p><span m='274050'>Now in fact, if
  we want to define, just</span> <span m='276530'>to double check that, where
  the y of t equals 0,</span> <span m='282159'>then we have a naught minus g
  over t</span> <span m='285690'>equals 1/5 a naught t to the 1/5 over t naught
  to the 1/4.</span> </p><p><span m='291360'>And so we have the quadratic-- we
  have this equation,</span> <span m='293970'>a naught minus g times t naught to
  the 1/4 equals t to the 1/4.</span> </p><p><span m='302130'>Or t equals 5
  times a naught minus g,</span> <span m='307010'>a quantity bigger than 1,
  times t naught.</span> </p><p><span m='310440'>This quantity is larger than
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='313310'>And so we see that when given this
  motion,</span> <span m='318720'>the place where the velocity reaches--</span>
  <span m='321465'>the position reaches its maximum would occur after t</span>
  <span m='325085'>equals t naught.</span> </p><p><span m='326120'>So this graph
  looks reasonable.</span> </p><p><span m='330370'>And that would be the plot of
  the position</span> <span m='335830'>function of the rocket as a function of
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='339040'>As an exercise, you may want to plot the
  velocity as a function</span> <span m='343880'>of t 2, to see how that
  looks.</span> </p><p><span m='347280'>That would correspond to making a plot
  of the slope</span> <span m='350540'>of the position function.</span>
