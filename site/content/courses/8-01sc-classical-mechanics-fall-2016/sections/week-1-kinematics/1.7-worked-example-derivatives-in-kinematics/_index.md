A home-built model rocket is launched straight up into the air. At time \\(\\displaystyle t = 0 \\) the rocket is at rest, about to be launched. The position of the rocket as a function of time is given by:

\\(\\displaystyle y(t) = \\frac{1}{2}(a\_0-g)t^2 - \\frac{1}{30}\\frac{a\_0 }{t\_{0}^{4}}t^{6} \\) for \\(\\displaystyle 0 \\lt t \\lt t\_0 \\)

where \\(\\displaystyle a\_0 \\) is a positive constant, \\(\\displaystyle g\\) is the acceleration of gravity and \\(\\displaystyle a\_0 > g \\). The contant \\(\\displaystyle t\_0\\) is the amount of time that the fuel takes to burn out. Express your answer in terms of g, t,\\(\\displaystyle a\_0\\), and \\(\\displaystyle t\_0\\).

Find \\(\\displaystyle a\\), the \\(\\displaystyle y \\)-component of the acceleration as a function of time.
