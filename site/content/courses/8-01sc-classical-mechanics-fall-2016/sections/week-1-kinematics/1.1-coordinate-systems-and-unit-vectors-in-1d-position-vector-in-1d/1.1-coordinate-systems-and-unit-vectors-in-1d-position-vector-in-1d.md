  <p><span m='3550'>We will now like to begin our analysis of motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6120'>And we'll start with one dimensional motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='7960'>Let's just consider a person running along a
  road.</span> </p><p><span m='12060'>And so here's our runner, and here's our
  road.</span> </p><p><span m='16780'>And what we want to do is be able to
  describe</span> <span m='19760'>the position, the velocity, the acceleration
  of this runner.</span> </p><p><span m='23710'>In order to do that, we need our
  first mathematical tool,</span> <span m='27140'>which is a coordinate
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='29680'>What is a coordinate system?</span>
  </p><p><span m='31160'>Well, the first thing that we want to choose is an
  origin.</span> </p><p><span m='35650'>We can pick the origin anywhere we
  want.</span> </p><p><span m='37530'>That's a degree of freedom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='38940'>So let's choose a point along our road as our
  origin.</span> </p><p><span m='43970'>The next thing to do is to choose an
  axis.</span> </p><p><span m='47520'>Well, the road is naturally
  defining</span> <span m='49520'>an axis for our problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='51080'>And so we'll call this the x-axis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='54650'>Now, along with that axis, we want</span> <span m='56790'>to divide
  that up into some type of units</span> <span m='60170'>so we might divide our
  axis like this.</span> </p><p><span m='64730'>And what's important here is to
  introduce</span> <span m='67480'>a positive coordinate direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='71160'>And so the way I'll do that, is I'll call this the plus
  x,</span> <span m='75100'>and on this side of the origin x is negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='79550'>Now, the third most important thing</span> <span
  m='83300'>is that we're going to talk about vectors and physics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='86560'>So we want a choice of unit vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='89934'>Now, because it's only one dimensional motion,</span> <span
  m='91850'>we only need one unit vector.</span> </p><p><span m='93770'>So what
  that means is a choice of unit vector at every point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='99200'>Let's just consider a point here, P1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='102570'>So our unit vector I'll call it i hat 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='107050'>Now, let's pick another point here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='109000'>We'll call this the point P2.</span> </p><p><span m='111070'>And
  over here we'll choose a unit vector, i hat 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='115039'>So every single point in space has a unit vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='119250'>Now, what's unique about this one</span> <span
  m='121510'>dimensional linear Cartesian coordinate</span> <span
  m='124230'>system is the following, these unit vectors</span> <span
  m='127780'>have the same magnitude-- a unit vector by definition</span> <span
  m='130990'>has magnitude 1-- and they're pointing in the same
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='137050'>So if two vectors have the same
  magnitude</span> <span m='139720'>and point in the same direction, they are
  equal.</span> </p><p><span m='143010'>So what makes this coordinate system
  unique,</span> <span m='145930'>this Cartesian coordinate system,</span> <span
  m='147470'>that every single point, no matter where we are,</span> <span
  m='151180'>the unit vectors point in the positive direction</span> <span
  m='154680'>because they have the same magnitude and direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='156910'>All of these unit vectors are equal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='159700'>And we call that i hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='162000'>So symbolically, we may draw a picture</span> <span m='165800'>and
  indicate our unit vector in the positive x direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='170180'>And this is our coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='172680'>And we can next begin to describe</span> <span m='174720'>the
  position and the velocity of our object</span> <span m='178070'>as it's moving
  along this x direction.</span> </p><p></p>
