title: 1.2 Position Vector in 1D
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3490'>Now that we've chosen a coordinate system</span> <span
  m='5200'>for our runner going along the road,</span> <span m='7340'>we now
  want to describe the position function</span> <span m='9710'>of our coordinate
  system with respect</span> <span m='11490'>to our choice of origin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='13170'>Now, the runner is a non-rigid object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='15190'>Legs and arms are moving back and forth.</span>
  </p><p><span m='17120'>So let's just imagine that there is some fixed</span>
  <span m='19420'>point in the runner at the center,</span> <span m='22540'>and
  let's give a vector.</span> </p><p><span m='25100'>So we're going to draw a
  vector from above our origin</span> <span m='28280'>to that point, and this is
  what we'll refer to</span> <span m='31880'>as our position function.</span>
  </p><p><span m='34430'>Now, remember, every point here has an
  x-coordinate,</span> <span m='38570'>so we can now introduce our position
  function,</span> <span m='42060'>which we'll call x of t, which is the
  coordinate location</span> <span m='45920'>with respect to the origin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='47750'>This is a function that will change in time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='50830'>And our position vector is r(t) equals the position
  function</span> <span m='55780'>x(t).</span> </p><p><span m='56910'>Now,
  remember, this is a vector.</span> </p><p><span m='58660'>The position
  function is just a quantity</span> <span m='62120'>that's describing the
  location of this point with respect</span> <span m='65390'>to the origin, but
  the unit vector</span> <span m='67980'>is how we describe this as a vector,
  and so we write i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='72580'>Now, x(t) is what we call
  the component of the position</span> <span m='77660'>vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='79120'>Remember, a vector has a component and a
  direction,</span> <span m='83670'>and the component is the position
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='87900'>And that component x(t) can be
  positive,</span> <span m='91900'>as you see in this particular case.</span>
  </p><p><span m='94960'>x(t) can also be zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='97430'>That's if you're located at the origin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='100539'>And if our runner is on the other side of the origin,</span> <span
  m='103539'>x(t) can be negative.</span> </p><p><span m='105810'>So the
  component of the position vector</span> <span m='108640'>can be positive,
  zero, or negative,</span> <span m='111210'>and the direction of the position
  vector</span> <span m='113970'>is the sine of the component times i
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='117020'>If the component is negative, then we have
  a negative i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='120550'>The position vector is
  pointing backwards in the minus x</span> <span m='123510'>direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='124630'>And if x(t) is positive, positive i hat
  position</span> <span m='128240'>vector as shown in this particular
  case</span> <span m='130780'>is in the positive i hat direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='133910'>So that's our first vector, the position
  vector,</span> <span m='137440'>in one-dimensional motion.</span> </p><p></p>
