title: 3.2 Instantaneous Velocity in 2D
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4070'>Recall, when we were examining the motion an object,</span>
  <span m='6940'>in two dimensions, we introduced Cartesian coordinates</span>
  <span m='9480'>and a position vector.</span> </p><p><span m='10860'>Now let's
  suppose the object has moved</span> <span m='14200'>to a new point, along the
  orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='18140'>Well, we'll write another vector r of
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='22980'>And let's say this took a time delta t to the
  new point.</span> </p><p><span m='28680'>And what we want to define is the
  displacement</span> <span m='32990'>of that object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34780'>So that's a vector delta r.</span> </p><p><span m='36990'>And recall
  that a vector of time of t plus delta t</span> <span m='40410'>is equal to the
  old vector r of t plus this displacement vector</span> <span m='47490'>delta
  r.</span> </p><p><span m='49040'>Now what we want to consider is a limit as
  delta t goes to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='58660'>And let's just look
  graphically at what that means.</span> </p><p><span m='63020'>As we move this
  delta, delta t-- as delta t</span> <span m='67540'>gets smaller and smaller
  and our object is getting closer</span> <span m='73140'>and closer to its
  position at time t,</span> <span m='77470'>and the position vector r of t plus
  delta t</span> <span m='80330'>is getting closer and closer to r of t delta
  t,</span> <span m='82970'>the key fact is that if we do a tangent to the
  orbit,</span> <span m='89400'>then the limit of delta r is approaching
  tangent</span> <span m='95929'>to the curve.</span> </p><p><span m='96470'>So
  in the limit, delta r, the direction</span> <span m='102940'>is tangent to the
  orbit.</span> </p><p><span m='109200'>So that's our first key property of
  delta r.</span> </p><p><span m='113289'>Now the second thing we want to
  express</span> <span m='115520'>is, if we write delta r, as a
  displacement</span> <span m='119870'>in the i-hat direction and a
  displacement</span> <span m='122680'>in the j-hat direction, now again,</span>
  <span m='125240'>maybe we can just clean this up a little bit,</span> <span
  m='128728'>and see what we mean by that.</span> </p><p><span m='130810'>So
  here's our delta r.</span> </p><p><span m='135640'>And we have a little delta
  x in this direction,</span> <span m='138500'>delta y in that direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='140360'>Remember delta x or delta y can be positive or
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='143850'>That's all right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='145230'>Now if we want to define our velocity as the limit,</span> <span
  m='150600'>as delta t goes to 0 of delta r over delta t,</span> <span
  m='155600'>then what we see is we have two pieces, the limit as delta t</span>
  <span m='158829'>goes to 0, of delta x over delta t i-hat, plus the
  limit</span> <span m='165810'>as delta t goes to 0 of delta y delta t
  j-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='174280'>And the definition of these
  limits,</span> <span m='177329'>we'll write that as the derivative dr,
  dt.</span> </p><p><span m='181210'>So the velocity is dr, dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='183860'>And that's equal to dx, dt, how that coordinate
  function is</span> <span m='188170'>changing in time, i-hat plus dy, dt
  j-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='195460'>Now as far as notation goes, we
  write</span> <span m='198380'>this philosophy as an x component of the
  velocity</span> <span m='203940'>plus a y component of the velocity,
  where</span> <span m='207440'>the x component, the x, is dx, dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='212260'>And the y component is dy, dt.</span> </p><p><span
  m='215960'>Now recall that the direction was tangent to the curve,</span>
  <span m='219550'>but the magnitude of the velocity,</span> <span
  m='221640'>what we call the speed, is just the sum</span> <span m='225070'>of
  the squares of the components, the square root.</span> </p><p><span
  m='228960'>And so now we've describe what we</span> <span m='231630'>refer to
  as the instantaneous velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='242480'>So far we've
  looked that a trajectory in two dimensions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='246170'>Let's again consider some type of motion</span> <span
  m='249030'>where we choose a positive y-axis, a positive x-axis,</span> <span
  m='253330'>an origin, e at vectors, i-hat and j-hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='257860'>And I'll have some type of trajectory,</span> <span
  m='259839'>where our object is moving like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='263010'>We know that at this particular time,</span> <span m='266820'>the
  velocity is tangent to this trajectory, at that point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='274390'>And now, what we'd like to do, is</span> <span m='277700'>try to
  describe-- we've described</span> <span m='280510'>it's two components ex and
  vy as a vector.</span> </p><p><span m='286020'>So if you did vector
  decomposition,</span> <span m='288730'>you would write a vector like this and
  a vector like that.</span> </p><p><span m='293870'>This is the x
  component.</span> </p><p><span m='296530'>That's the y component.</span>
  </p><p><span m='298570'>And now if I define this angle theta,</span> <span
  m='302270'>we know that a vector has a direction and a magnitude.</span>
  </p><p><span m='305960'>We've seen what we call the magnitude the
  speed.</span> </p><p><span m='309600'>So that's just the sum of these
  components squared,</span> <span m='313240'>square root.</span> </p><p><span
  m='314160'>Speed is always positive.</span> </p><p><span m='315580'>So we
  always take the positive square root.</span> </p><p><span m='318590'>And now
  what about the direction of this vector in the xy plane?</span> </p><p><span
  m='323210'>Well, we can see from our geometry</span> <span m='326530'>that the
  tangent theta is given by the y</span> <span m='331110'>component over the x
  component.</span> </p><p><span m='334460'>Or one could say that the angle
  theta, at this given time,</span> <span m='339310'>is the inverse function of
  vy over vx.</span> </p><p><span m='344270'>And so now we've described not only
  the direction of velocity,</span> <span m='348740'>but the angle that it's
  making with the horizontal axis.</span> </p><p><span m='353590'>And so we have
  now completely described the velocity,</span> <span m='356540'>instantaneous
  velocity, vector at time t</span> <span m='359640'>in terms of its two
  component functions, its speed</span> <span m='363450'>and the angle that
  makes at the positive x-axis.</span> </p>
