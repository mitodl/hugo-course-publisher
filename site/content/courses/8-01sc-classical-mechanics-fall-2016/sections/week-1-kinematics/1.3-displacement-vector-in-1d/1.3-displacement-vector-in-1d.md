title: 1.3 Displacement Vector in 1D
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3580'>Now that we've described the position vector of the
  runner,</span> <span m='6510'>let's try to describe what happens in
  time</span> <span m='8540'>as a runner moves along our road.</span>
  </p><p><span m='10510'>Suppose at a later time our runner has gone down the
  road</span> <span m='15480'>just a little bit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='17000'>And so the runner has moved a little bit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='21060'>Remember, at time t, we described the position vector</span> <span
  m='26330'>r(t) was equal to the coordinate function</span> <span m='31060'>x
  as a function of time i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='34070'>And this distance
  here was our x(t).</span> </p><p><span m='38060'>Now, our position vector a
  little bit later.</span> </p><p><span m='41530'>So here we are at time t plus
  delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='45570'>The runner has moved a little
  bit.</span> </p><p><span m='47430'>And we'll now describe the position
  vector--</span> <span m='50380'>because I don't want to overlap it--</span>
  <span m='52570'>that center point is up here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='54670'>It's going to point in this direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='57260'>And this is what we call r(t) plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='61950'>In that vector, r(t) plus delta t,</span> <span m='65830'>the
  coordinate function is no longer at time t</span> <span m='68980'>but t plus
  delta t i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='72880'>And we would now like to
  describe</span> <span m='74720'>the displacement vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='76620'>So our next step is to describe the displacement vector</span> <span
  m='83520'>for the interval t to t plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='88890'>And that displacement vector is defined-- we use the symbol</span>
  <span m='92300'>delta r, and what we mean is the vector r(t)</span> <span
  m='97280'>plus delta t minus the vector r(t).</span> </p><p><span
  m='101750'>Now, what that vector corresponds to</span> <span m='104940'>is the
  vector right here.</span> </p><p><span m='107200'>This is our delta r.</span>
  </p><p><span m='110130'>And if we now use our two definitions here,</span>
  <span m='113850'>then this becomes x(t) plus delta t minus x(t) i hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='124030'>And this quantity here we refer to as the
  component</span> <span m='129100'>of the displacement vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='132270'>So delta x is the component of the displacement
  vector.</span> </p><p><span m='144290'>And as before, the component can be
  positive,</span> <span m='149450'>which would correspond to the person
  moving</span> <span m='152180'>a positive component, positive i hat
  direction,</span> <span m='155540'>in the positive x direction as shown in
  this figure.</span> </p><p><span m='159180'>If the displacement of vector is
  zero,</span> <span m='162040'>the person could have run forward</span> <span
  m='163450'>and come back and at time t plus delta t</span> <span m='166510'>be
  in exactly the same spot as time t.</span> </p><p><span m='170040'>The
  displacement vector is zero in that case.</span> </p><p><span m='174240'>The
  displacement vector could have</span> <span m='177060'>a component that's
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='179430'>And what negative means is at the end
  of this interval-- t</span> <span m='182600'>plus delta t-- that the person is
  to the left of the runner.</span> </p><p><span m='188460'>And so this quantity
  would be negative.</span> </p><p><span m='191250'>And so this is our crucial
  displacement vector that</span> <span m='194470'>describes only the difference
  in positions between the person,</span> <span m='198890'>between time t plus
  delta t, and time t.</span> </p><p></p>
