title: 2.1 Introduction to Acceleration
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3690'>Now that we've described the instantaneous velocity</span>
  <span m='6210'>of an object, we'd now like to describe</span> <span
  m='8450'>what it's acceleration is.</span> </p><p><span m='10210'>Philosophy
  and acceleration are complicated things.</span> </p><p><span m='13060'>One of
  the reasons why acceleration</span> <span m='14850'>is such an abstract
  quantity is for example,</span> <span m='17710'>if I take this marker that's
  in my hand</span> <span m='19540'>and I throw it up in the air and I catch
  it,</span> <span m='23160'>you can see with your eye, velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='26230'>You can see the speed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='28040'>You have a sense for it.</span> </p><p><span m='29470'>You can see
  it change its direction.</span> </p><p><span m='31520'>So velocity is
  something that as a human being,</span> <span m='34010'>with our eye as a
  mechanism for determining motion-- velocity</span> <span m='38020'>is a very
  basic concept.</span> </p><p><span m='40570'>But acceleration is a much harder
  concept.</span> </p><p><span m='43670'>For instance, when I take that same
  object</span> <span m='46100'>and I drop that-- as it falls down,</span> <span
  m='50700'>its velocity is increasing.</span> </p><p><span m='52530'>And so we
  say it has an acceleration,</span> <span m='54920'>but is that acceleration a
  function of time?</span> </p><p><span m='58060'>Or is it constant in
  time?</span> </p><p><span m='60270'>Is it varying in time?</span> </p><p><span
  m='61550'>Is it a polynomial?</span> </p><p><span m='62570'>Is it a
  constant?</span> </p><p><span m='63640'>Those are much harder to see.</span>
  </p><p><span m='65489'>Again, let's drop this object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='68210'>So when I drop that object and I catch it down here,</span> <span
  m='71620'>our eye does not tell us intuitively anything</span> <span
  m='75220'>about the mathematical nature of that acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78060'>And that's why acceleration is a much more abstract
  quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='82320'>In fact, a great question is the
  following.</span> </p><p><span m='85530'>When I throw this object up in the
  air-- let's</span> <span m='88170'>focus at its highest point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='90140'>So I throw it in the air and it comes down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='93830'>When the object was at its highest point,</span> <span
  m='97390'>was its velocity zero?</span> </p><p><span m='100100'>Was its
  acceleration zero or non-zero?</span> </p><p><span m='104910'>A hint to this
  question is in Newton's second law,</span> <span m='107710'>F equals
  ma.</span> </p><p><span m='110140'>If there is a force acting on this
  object,</span> <span m='112070'>there must be an acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114180'>And that forces the gravitational force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='117310'>And when this object was at the top of its
  motion</span> <span m='121040'>I didn't turn the earth off.</span>
  </p><p><span m='123100'>So there is still a gravitational force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='126030'>And so for an object in free fall-- now free
  fall</span> <span m='134140'>just as under the-- which means under the
  influence</span> <span m='141329'>of the gravitational force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='149950'>We can conclude from Newton's second law</span> <span
  m='152940'>that the gravitational force, ma--</span> <span m='157420'>so this
  gravitational force is non-zero.</span> </p><p><span m='164260'>And so
  therefore, the acceleration is also non-zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='169829'>So once again, as I throw this object up</span> <span m='172600'>in
  the air nobody turned gravity off, we're not in empty space,</span> <span
  m='177740'>and near the surface of the Earth</span> <span m='179690'>the
  gravitational force is not zero.</span> </p><p><span m='181810'>The
  acceleration is not zero.</span> </p><p><span m='183500'>So throughout this
  motion this object is accelerating.</span> </p><p><span m='187640'>I choose
  this example to show you that acceleration</span> <span m='191460'>is a very
  abstract concept.</span> </p><p><span m='193540'>And now our goal is to figure
  out</span> <span m='195540'>how to mathematically define acceleration</span>
  <span m='198060'>in terms of our velocity.</span> </p><p></p>
