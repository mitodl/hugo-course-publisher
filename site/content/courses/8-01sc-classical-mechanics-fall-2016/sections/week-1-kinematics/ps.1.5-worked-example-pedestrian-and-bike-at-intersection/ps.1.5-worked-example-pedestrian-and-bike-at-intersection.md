  <p><span m='3320'>You're standing at a traffic intersection.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5420'>And you start to accelerate when the light turns
  green.</span> </p><p><span m='8119'>Suppose that your acceleration as a
  function of time</span> <span m='12490'>is a constant for some time interval t
  less than t one.</span> </p><p><span m='18200'>And after that, it's zero for a
  time after t one less than t</span> <span m='24470'>less than some time t
  two.</span> </p><p><span m='27340'>At the exact same instant the light turns
  green,</span> <span m='30290'>a bicyclist is coming through the
  intersection.</span> </p><p><span m='33090'>And the bicyclist has some initial
  speed</span> <span m='36610'>and is braking with an acceleration of
  minus</span> <span m='40900'>b two for the entire time interval t two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='46980'>And at time t two, the bicyclist comes</span> <span
  m='52650'>to rest exactly where you are located.</span> </p><p><span
  m='61950'>And we also know some initial conditions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='66100'>So our initial conditions in this problem</span> <span m='69830'>are
  that you're accelerating b one at a rate two</span> <span m='73930'>meters per
  second squared.</span> </p><p><span m='75820'>And you do this for time t one
  equals one second.</span> </p><p><span m='79430'>And the bicyclist comes into
  the intersection.</span> </p><p><span m='81490'>We'll call that b two
  naught.</span> </p><p><span m='85382'>That's the initial speed of the
  bicyclist</span> <span m='87090'>at three meters per second.</span>
  </p><p><span m='89610'>And the question is, what is the rate of
  deceleration</span> <span m='95050'>of the bicyclist b two?</span>
  </p><p><span m='98060'>Now this can be quite a complicated problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='101780'>So the first thing we want to do is just make a
  sketch</span> <span m='104990'>and think about what's involved.</span>
  </p><p><span m='107360'>This problem involves two objects.</span> </p><p><span
  m='111020'>You and the bicyclist.</span> </p><p><span m='115350'>The person--
  that's you-- has two stages of motion.</span> </p><p><span m='125470'>And the
  bicyclist only has one stage of motion.</span> </p><p><span m='132820'>So to
  get started, it always helps</span> <span m='136100'>to choose a coordinate
  system and to make</span> <span m='138240'>some sketches of the
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='139910'>So let's say we choose a-- it's all
  one dimensional motion.</span> </p><p><span m='144220'>Two objects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='145260'>One dimensional motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150010'>And so we'll pick an origin at the light at the one</span> <span
  m='154370'>side of the intersection.</span> </p><p><span m='155850'>And we
  have two objects which we'll talk about.</span> </p><p><span m='158850'>You, x
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='161410'>And the bicycle is x two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='164860'>Actually we don't know yet who's in front of the
  other.</span> </p><p><span m='169880'>The bicyclist will be first in front of
  you.</span> </p><p><span m='172920'>So now how do we sketch the motion</span>
  <span m='175360'>of these two stages of motion?</span> </p><p><span
  m='177630'>So let's make a sketch.</span> </p><p><span m='179960'>And let's
  start with the person.</span> </p><p><span m='181880'>Well, the person-- if we
  plotted their position</span> <span m='184900'>as a function of time-- this
  would be position in general.</span> </p><p><span m='187872'>I'll just draw
  the person function.</span> </p><p><span m='189330'>They're accelerating to
  time t one.</span> </p><p><span m='193210'>And then they're moving at a
  constant speed at time t two.</span> </p><p><span m='199500'>Now the bicyclist
  is a little more complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='202410'>Because initially
  the bicyclist has a-- this at time t,</span> <span m='209130'>person
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='212970'>Initially the bicyclist has a non-zero
  slope.</span> </p><p><span m='217930'>And they're decelerating.</span>
  </p><p><span m='220790'>And they reach you with a zero slope.</span>
  </p><p><span m='224180'>So this graph, this is the x two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='229340'>That is the bicyclist.</span> </p><p><span m='231340'>And right
  here we have the person.</span> </p><p><span m='233380'>x one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='235210'>So now to build a strategy, we can even look at our
  graph</span> <span m='239840'>and see that from our initial conditions,</span>
  <span m='242670'>we have some special conditions that the-- our strategy
  will</span> <span m='250240'>be to-- one-- figure out what this time
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='254830'>And we know that the bicyclist at time t
  two</span> <span m='259519'>has come to a stop.</span> </p><p><span
  m='262120'>So that's one condition.</span> </p><p><span m='264140'>And we also
  know that the bicyclist</span> <span m='265760'>comes to stop exactly at the
  same position as the person.</span> </p><p><span m='270270'>x one of t two
  equals x two of t two.</span> </p><p><span m='275420'>So those are two
  conditions that we</span> <span m='277580'>can deduce from all of this given
  information.</span> </p><p><span m='281150'>And now we comply our kinematic
  relationships</span> <span m='284520'>for both the bicyclist and the
  person</span> <span m='287980'>and try to see if these conditions will
  enable</span> <span m='290970'>us to deduce what b two is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='294600'>So let's begin with the bicyclist.</span> </p><p><span
  m='297670'>So the velocity of the bicyclist as a function of time</span> <span
  m='301730'>is simply the integration of that bicyclist b t</span> <span
  m='306020'>prime from zero to t two.</span> </p><p><span m='307690'>This is
  one stage of motion.</span> </p><p><span m='310220'>The acceleration is minus
  b two.</span> </p><p><span m='311889'>So this is a very straightforward
  interval.</span> </p><p><span m='313680'>This is just b of two t two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='318520'>b two.</span> </p><p><span m='319730'>This is minus
  the initial speed equals that.</span> </p><p><span m='323590'>b of t two minus
  V of the initial is that.</span> </p><p><span m='328440'>And because we want
  this to be zero,</span> <span m='331140'>we have the condition that t two
  equals</span> <span m='333430'>V two naught divided by b two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='337330'>So that's our first condition for the
  bicyclist.</span> </p><p><span m='341350'>Now we have to separately solve for
  the bicyclist's position.</span> </p><p><span m='346460'>That's easy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='347850'>x two of t is the integral of V two t prime dt prime
  from zero</span> <span m='354409'>to t two.</span> </p><p><span m='355490'>And
  that's just minus one half.</span> </p><p><span m='360780'>We want to make
  sure that we get the displacement.</span> </p><p><span m='365030'>But x two
  naught is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='367320'>So we have x two at t two
  equals the integral of the velocity</span> <span m='376100'>function, which is
  V two naught minus b two</span> <span m='382210'>of t prime, d t prime from
  zero to t two.</span> </p><p><span m='386850'>And so we get b two naught t two
  minus one half b two t</span> <span m='393820'>two squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='395020'>And when we input this condition in for t two,</span>
  <span m='398120'>this becomes very simply V two naught squared over two b
  two.</span> </p><p><span m='405350'>Substituting t two into each of these
  expressions</span> <span m='409200'>gives us that relationship.</span>
  </p><p><span m='411300'>So that's the position of the cyclist at time t
  two.</span> </p><p><span m='416790'>Now this is a little bit trickier</span>
  <span m='418360'>to get the position of the person.</span> </p><p><span
  m='421780'>So in order to do that, we first find the velocity</span> <span
  m='425960'>of the person function.</span> </p><p><span m='427520'>It's a two
  stage motion.</span> </p><p><span m='429210'>So for the first stage of motion,
  the velocity</span> <span m='432250'>two-- the velocity of person one--</span>
  <span m='436570'>minus their initial velocity, which is zero minus one
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='440110'>That's zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='441156'>Equals the integral of b one dt prime from zero</span> <span
  m='447470'>to t one, which is just b one t one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='456430'>And this velocity remains constant</span> <span
  m='460450'>throughout the next interval.</span> </p><p><span m='463240'>So we
  can write the velocity function in the following way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='468560'>V one t equals b one t for zero less than t less than t one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='476810'>And afterwards, a constant velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='481830'>Now this is the function that we need to
  integrate</span> <span m='486270'>to get the displacement.</span> </p><p><span
  m='488170'>So let's get ourselves a little room here and integrate
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='494810'>And we have x of t is two
  integrals.</span> </p><p><span m='500600'>First from zero to t one, the
  velocity</span> <span m='504110'>function during that time interval.</span>
  </p><p><span m='507100'>And then for the second time interval dt two,</span>
  <span m='511110'>the velocity function is constant b-- this is b one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='516181'>b one t one, dt prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m='520289'>Notice this is not a variable.</span> </p><p><span m='522808'>But
  it is the time at the end of the interval.</span> </p><p><span m='525589'>And
  when we make these two intervals,</span> <span m='527130'>we get one half b
  one t one squared.</span> </p><p><span m='531560'>Let's make this the velocity
  at time t.</span> </p><p><span m='538640'>This first integral goes from zero
  to t one.</span> </p><p><span m='542160'>And the second interval, we're
  going</span> <span m='544030'>to make this the position at time t two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='547620'>And we get plus V one times t one times t two minus t
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='555910'>We have a common term, t one squared, b,
  one half b</span> <span m='559880'>one t one squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='560830'>b one minus b one, t one squared.</span> </p><p><span m='563780'>So
  this reduces to one half b one t one squared</span> <span m='568820'>plus b
  one, t one, t two.</span> </p><p><span m='572870'>And that's how we find the
  position</span> <span m='574610'>of the person for our interval.</span>
  </p><p><span m='578960'>Let's just review that to make sure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='580630'>Because we had to get the velocity function
  first.</span> </p><p><span m='583580'>And then we integrated the velocity in
  each time interval</span> <span m='588040'>correctly in order to get the
  position function.</span> </p><p><span m='591070'>Now we can apply our
  conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='593760'>Notice we already know t two
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='596740'>And we can now apply the second
  condition</span> <span m='599310'>which says that the position of the
  bicyclist at time t two,</span> <span m='605160'>which we found to be d naught
  squared over two b two</span> <span m='608770'>is equal to the position of the
  person at that same time.</span> </p><p><span m='614090'>So that's minus one
  half b one t one squared plus b one t one.</span> </p><p><span m='619650'>Now
  let's make that substitution for time t two.</span> </p><p><span m='623530'>So
  that's V two naught over b two.</span> </p><p><span m='627520'>And now our
  problem is to solve for this time b two.</span> </p><p><span m='633450'>And
  we're given b one.</span> </p><p><span m='635830'>We're given t one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='637530'>We're given V two naught.</span> </p><p><span
  m='639390'>And the only variable here is b two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='642260'>It's a little bit of algebra to rearrange terms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='645240'>What I'll do is I'll bring this term over to
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='647910'>So now we'll just do a little bit of
  algebra.</span> </p><p><span m='651680'>We have to a b two we can pull
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='654410'>I have a minus b one t one b two
  naught.</span> </p><p><span m='658810'>And that's equal to minus one half b
  one t one squared.</span> </p><p><span m='663640'>And now I can solve for b
  two.</span> </p><p><span m='666350'>And so I get b two is equal to Vt
  naught</span> <span m='670290'>squared minus b one t one b two naught over
  minus one half b</span> <span m='677210'>one t one squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='680590'>Now let's just do a quick dimensional check.</span>
  </p><p><span m='686680'>b times t has the dimensions of velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='689750'>So this is velocity squared, velocity squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='691930'>That's OK upstairs.</span> </p><p><span m='693570'>b
  times t squared is dimensions of position.</span> </p><p><span m='696740'>So
  what we have is meters squared per second squared</span> <span
  m='699860'>divided by meters.</span> </p><p><span m='701360'>That gives us
  meters per second squared.</span> </p><p><span m='703830'>So we're pretty
  confident that we at least didn't</span> <span m='706800'>make an algebraic
  mistake.</span> </p><p><span m='708750'>And now our last step is to substitute
  in the numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='713370'>And what we get is, if we put
  in the three meters</span> <span m='716980'>a second squared minus b one times
  t one times three,</span> <span m='723170'>we get upstairs is minus
  3/2.</span> </p><p><span m='727710'>And downstairs is two times one
  second.</span> </p><p><span m='731710'>Two's cancel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='733090'>So we get to 3/2 meters per second squared</span> <span
  m='740380'>when we put in the numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='743680'>If we
  wanted to check our result,</span> <span m='745930'>we can then see what time
  we get.</span> </p><p><span m='749456'>t two is is three meters per second
  divided by our b two</span> <span m='761400'>which is 3/2 meters per second
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='764570'>So that's 2 seconds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='767340'>And now the last check would be to see that the
  position</span> <span m='771580'>functions correspond to that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='773530'>Let's see if we can just do that quickly in our
  heads.</span> </p><p><span m='777440'>Our position function for the
  person</span> <span m='779570'>is V naught squared over two b two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='784470'>So that's 9 meters per second.</span> </p><p><span
  m='791110'>9 meters squared seconds squared over two times</span> <span
  m='793660'>3/2 meters second squared.</span> </p><p><span m='798000'>And that
  comes out to x two of t.</span> </p><p><span m='802590'>This is a check, is 3
  meters.</span> </p><p><span m='805480'>And the x one of t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='810730'>We left out the one there.</span> </p><p><span m='811870'>We should
  have had it.</span> </p><p><span m='813450'>It's a little more complicated to
  put in here.</span> </p><p><span m='816090'>But we'll just run the numbers
  quickly through.</span> </p><p><span m='818870'>Two times one seconds
  minus.</span> </p><p><span m='820730'>That's a minus one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='822080'>Two times one times two.</span> </p><p><span m='824730'>That's two
  times two.</span> </p><p><span m='825860'>So this is also three meters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='828390'>And we actually have the right answer here.</span>
