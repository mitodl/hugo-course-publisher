  <p><span m='3640'>Let's consider a very simple example</span> <span
  m='5780'>of a runner in which our position function x of t</span> <span
  m='10310'>is given as a quadratic function in time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='13150'>It will be a constant b times t squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='16350'>Here, b is a constant.</span> </p><p><span m='18940'>Now it's always
  important in SI units</span> <span m='20820'>to consider what the units of
  this constant is.</span> </p><p><span m='23200'>Because a position function is
  measured in meters</span> <span m='26400'>and time is measured in seconds, b
  is a constant</span> <span m='29980'>and it has units of meters per second
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='34170'>And there's an example of a
  runner--</span> <span m='36470'>and let's make a plot of that position
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='40210'>So we're going to plot x of t as a
  function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='44370'>b here-- let's make b a
  positive constant.</span> </p><p><span m='47920'>And so our function looks
  something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='52100'>Now, the velocity--
  component of the velocity-- remember v of t</span> <span m='56400'>is given by
  dx dt of this function.</span> </p><p><span m='60660'>And the derivative of a
  polynomial t squared</span> <span m='63540'>is very simple.</span>
  </p><p><span m='64500'>That's just simply 2b times t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='69080'>Again, let's look at our units.</span> </p><p><span
  m='70630'>Because b has the units of meters per second squared,</span> <span
  m='74100'>and when multiplying that by second,</span> <span m='75920'>we have
  the units of velocity in SI units as meters per second.</span> </p><p><span
  m='80470'>Now let's plot that function.</span> </p><p><span m='83170'>Notice
  this is a linear function.</span> </p><p><span m='87970'>And so if I plotted
  underneath here, the velocity</span> <span m='93930'>as a function of time, it
  starts off with a zero slope.</span> </p><p><span m='101590'>Remember we're
  looking-- our velocity at any given time</span> <span m='107250'>corresponds
  to the slope of a tangent line to the position</span> <span
  m='112280'>function.</span> </p><p><span m='113900'>And you can see that slope
  is increasing.</span> </p><p><span m='116660'>Now you wouldn't know it from
  this graph,</span> <span m='119240'>but if you did plot t squared, it's
  increasing linearly.</span> </p><p><span m='122330'>And so our velocity
  function-- the initial slope</span> <span m='124950'>is 0 at t equal 0, and
  it's increasing linearly in time.</span> </p><p><span m='129490'>So we'll just
  draw that as some linear function.</span> </p><p><span m='133560'>And the
  slope here of this function</span> <span m='136730'>will be now the
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='139540'>So a of t is the derivative of
  the component of the velocity</span> <span m='145340'>function as a function
  of time.</span> </p><p><span m='147240'>And this derivative is quite
  easy.</span> </p><p><span m='149510'>It's just simply 2 b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='152240'>Now notice those have the units of meters</span> <span
  m='155079'>per second squared, which are units for acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='160250'>When we, again, look at the slope,</span> <span
  m='164760'>notice that at every single point,</span> <span m='168140'>the
  slope of the velocity as a function of time is a constant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='175170'>The slope here is just equal to 2b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='179420'>And so now if we plotted our acceleration function,</span> <span
  m='185510'>we have this point 2 b, and every single point</span> <span
  m='189180'>has the same value of acceleration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='192790'>So here the acceleration is an example</span> <span m='196420'>of
  constant acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='200400'>And this is our simplest
  case.</span> </p><p><span m='202770'>Notice we started with the position
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='204750'>We differentiate to get the component
  of the velocity</span> <span m='207660'>and to get the component of the
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='210520'>So this is a very simple model
  for a runner</span> <span m='213870'>whose increasing speed linearly,
  accelerating</span> <span m='217079'>at a constant rate.</span> </p><p></p>
