  <p><span m='3520'>Let's now consider two dimensional motion,</span> <span
  m='5870'>and let's try to analyze how to describe</span> <span m='8039'>the
  change in velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='9570'>So again, let's choose a
  coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='13630'>We have an origin plus y plus
  x.</span> </p><p><span m='17300'>And let's draw the trajectory of our
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='21100'>And now let's draw the object at two
  different times.</span> </p><p><span m='24810'>So for instance, if I call this
  the location at time t1,</span> <span m='31510'>and a little bit later here,
  this</span> <span m='33420'>is the location of the object at time t2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='37225'>We'll call our unit vectors i hat and j hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='44740'>We know that the direction of the velocity</span> <span
  m='47610'>is tangent to this curve.</span> </p><p><span m='50040'>So if we
  draw v at time t1-- and over here,</span> <span m='56410'>notice the direction
  has changed v at time t2.</span> </p><p><span m='62106'>And what we'd like to
  do now is describe, just as before,</span> <span m='65840'>that our
  acceleration a of t is the derivative of the velocity</span> <span
  m='72760'>as a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='74530'>What that means
  is the limit as delta t goes</span> <span m='77850'>to 0 of delta v over delta
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='82180'>Now, it's much harder to visualize the delta
  v</span> <span m='87260'>in this drawing.</span> </p><p><span m='88640'>And
  partly, the reason for that is these velocity vectors</span> <span
  m='92289'>are located at two different points.</span> </p><p><span
  m='94870'>And right now, the backs of these vectors</span> <span
  m='99110'>have different places in space.</span> </p><p><span m='101180'>But
  remember that delta v is just v, in this case,</span> <span m='106890'>at time
  t2 minus v at time t1.</span> </p><p><span m='111870'>And our principle for
  subtracting two vectors</span> <span m='114580'>at different locations in
  space is</span> <span m='117190'>to draw the vectors where we put the tails at
  the same location.</span> </p><p><span m='121820'>So here's a tail at this
  vector.</span> </p><p><span m='123600'>We're just going to translate that
  vector in space.</span> </p><p><span m='127770'>That is still v at time
  t1.</span> </p><p><span m='130910'>These vectors are equal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='132050'>They have the same length, and they have the same
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='136060'>And so delta v is just the
  vector</span> <span m='139050'>that connects here to there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='142360'>That's what we mean by delta v.</span> </p><p><span
  m='144880'>And so you can see in this particular case</span> <span
  m='147600'>that it's not obvious from looking at the orbit what</span> <span
  m='151390'>the delta v is.</span> </p><p><span m='152730'>So what we need to
  do is just trust our calculus.</span> </p><p><span m='157720'>And so when we
  write the velocity as dx dt i hat plus dy</span> <span m='167006'>dy j hat,
  and we're now treating each direction independently.</span> </p><p><span
  m='174640'>We call this vx i hat plus vy j hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='180520'>So that's our velocity vector.</span> </p><p><span m='182420'>Then
  our acceleration is just the derivative of the velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='188130'>We take each direction separately,</span> <span m='190190'>so we
  have dv x dt i hat plus dv y dt j hat.</span> </p><p><span m='199220'>Now,
  again, notice that velocity v of x</span> <span m='206250'>is already the
  first derivative of the position</span> <span m='213040'>of the exponent
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='215020'>So what we really have here is the
  second derivative</span> <span m='220290'>of the position function in the i
  hat</span> <span m='224820'>direction and the second derivative of the
  component</span> <span m='227390'>function in the y direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='229690'>And that is what we call the instantaneous
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='233920'>Now, again, this is sometimes
  awkward to draw,</span> <span m='237060'>but you always must remember that
  this x component</span> <span m='243060'>of the acceleration by
  definition</span> <span m='246500'>is the second derivative of the component
  function</span> <span m='249640'>or the first derivative of the
  component</span> <span m='253350'>function for the velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='255020'>And likewise, the y component of the acceleration
  ay</span> <span m='261050'>is the second derivative of the component</span>
  <span m='264990'>function for position.</span> </p><p><span m='267180'>And
  that's also equal, by definition,</span> <span m='270990'>to the first
  derivative of the component of the velocity</span> <span
  m='274760'>vector.</span> </p><p><span m='276350'>And that's how we describe
  the acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='280390'>As before, we can talk about
  the magnitude of a vector.</span> </p><p><span m='284010'>And the magnitude of
  a we'll just write as a.</span> </p><p><span m='287355'>It's the components
  squared, added together, taken</span> <span m='293220'>square root.</span>
  </p><p><span m='294740'>And that's our magnitude.</span> </p><p><span
  m='298520'>And so now we've described all of our kinematic quantities</span>
  <span m='301850'>in two dimensions-- the position,</span> <span m='303920'>the
  velocity as the derivative of the position,</span> <span m='306950'>and the
  acceleration as the derivative of the velocity</span> <span m='310580'>where
  each direction is treated independently.</span> </p><p></p>
