title: 3.4 Projectile Motion
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3450'>One of the most common motions we see in our everyday
  lives</span> <span m='7270'>is the path of an object moving thrown</span>
  <span m='10820'>and moving through space.</span> </p><p><span m='12870'>Now,
  this type of motion has a very famous name</span> <span m='15220'>called
  projectile motion.</span> </p><p><span m='17160'>And when we look at it, let's
  introduce a coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='21600'>i hat and j
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='24270'>Here's our y plus y-axis and our plus
  x-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='28080'>Then, in order to understand the
  kinematics of this motion,</span> <span m='31150'>we'd like to apply Newton's
  second law.</span> </p><p><span m='33380'>So separately we'll draw our
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='36670'>It has gravitational force acting
  downward.</span> </p><p><span m='39990'>Remember our unit vectors in the j hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='43290'>And so when we write our equations of
  motion,</span> <span m='47890'>f equals ma.</span> </p><p><span m='48880'>We
  have two different directions.</span> </p><p><span m='50800'>In the j hat
  direction, we have the gravitational force</span> <span m='54070'>downward
  minus mg.</span> </p><p><span m='56100'>And remember here that g is our
  positive quantity, 9.8 meters</span> <span m='62710'>per second, and we have m
  a y.</span> </p><p><span m='67380'>Newton's second law equates these two
  different things.</span> </p><p><span m='71160'>And that's-- we'll write it
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='73980'>So those two quantities are
  equal.</span> </p><p><span m='76140'>And so our conclusion is that the
  acceleration</span> <span m='80730'>is equal to minus g in the y
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='86090'>Now, likewise, keep in mind that
  we</span> <span m='88920'>have our horizontal direction as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='91330'>And notice that we're now assuming that there's</span>
  <span m='93979'>no horizontal forces.</span> </p><p><span m='95440'>In the
  real world, there can be all types of air resistances.</span> </p><p><span
  m='98630'>But here, for the simplicity of this model,</span> <span
  m='100860'>we have no horizontal forces.</span> </p><p><span m='102670'>So we
  have 0 equals m a x.</span> </p><p><span m='106160'>And so we have our
  separate equation, a x equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m='110820'>Now, both of
  these equations are equations that we've already</span> <span m='114080'>been
  working with in kinematics.</span> </p><p><span m='115950'>Here we have a
  constant acceleration,</span> <span m='118759'>and here we have zero
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='120500'>So using the results that we had
  earlier from integration,</span> <span m='124150'>we can write down the
  equations of motion</span> <span m='127020'>in the y and the x
  directions.</span> </p><p><span m='129610'>First, we'll write the
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='132020'>Vy as a function of time is equal to
  some initial value.</span> </p><p><span m='137579'>And because the
  acceleration is negative, minus gt.</span> </p><p><span m='141329'>You can
  test your integration technique to see that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='145540'>And the position as a function of time,</span> <span
  m='148490'>remember, is just some constant value.</span> </p><p><span
  m='151880'>This is our constant y nought.</span> </p><p><span m='154390'>And
  we have plus vy nought t minus 1/2 gt squared again</span> <span
  m='162340'>doing integration.</span> </p><p><span m='163980'>Now, the
  horizontal equation of motion,</span> <span m='167620'>the x(t), because there
  is no acceleration</span> <span m='171510'>in the horizontal direction,
  this</span> <span m='174170'>is a constant value given by the initial value of
  the component</span> <span m='179130'>of the velocity in the x
  direction</span> <span m='181400'>and the position x(t) is then equal to some
  initial position</span> <span m='187260'>plus Vx nought t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='190190'>And so those are our functions of time</span> <span m='192930'>for
  the components of the velocity</span> <span m='195160'>and the components of
  position.</span> </p><p><span m='197680'>Now, for our particular example, it's
  much easier.</span> </p><p><span m='201780'>Here we have X nought equal to
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='204560'>Notice that our object is starting at the
  origin.</span> </p><p><span m='209180'>And so that tells us that x as a
  function of time</span> <span m='213579'>is just Vx nought t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='215150'>I'm dropping the parentheses t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='217910'>Remember, that's not a product.</span> </p><p><span
  m='219620'>That's just a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='221970'>And
  given this fact, that tells us</span> <span m='224210'>that t is x divided by
  Vx nought,</span> <span m='228522'>and now I can take this value of t</span>
  <span m='231079'>and put it into our vertical equation</span> <span
  m='233850'>and I get V y is some initial value plus V y nought x over
  Vx</span> <span m='242230'>nought, substituting for t, minus 1/2 gx</span>
  <span m='247520'>squared over V x nought squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='252450'>When we described projectile motion,</span> <span m='254500'>we had
  an equation describing y as a function of t,</span> <span m='259720'>an
  equation describing x as a function</span> <span m='262140'>of t-- the
  horizontal motion and the vertical motion--</span> <span m='264430'>and here
  we have a separate equation,</span> <span m='267130'>which is describing the y
  as a function of x.</span> </p><p><span m='270960'>Notice there is no time
  involved in this equation.</span> </p><p><span m='274159'>Now, let's try to
  look at graphically</span> <span m='275980'>what we're seeing here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='277480'>So, for instance, when we look at a plot of the motion
  of y</span> <span m='282280'>versus x, we can see the vertical component
  going</span> <span m='286540'>up and down and we can see the horizontal
  component moving</span> <span m='290850'>to the right while the object is
  following this trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m='296100'>And this is a
  parabolic trajectory</span> <span m='298530'>of y as a function of x.</span>
  </p><p><span m='301870'>Now, if we wanted to actually plot out y as a function
  of t,</span> <span m='306790'>then here we can look at the simulation</span>
  <span m='309180'>where we're just looking at the y component</span> <span
  m='311830'>and you can see that that motion too is a parabola.</span>
  </p><p><span m='315970'>However, what's crucial to look at is</span> <span
  m='318700'>that it's y as a function of t and not y as a function of x.</span>
  </p><p><span m='325750'>Finally, we can look at the horizontal motion</span>
  <span m='328060'>and again recall that when we looked at the trajectory as
  y</span> <span m='332010'>as a function of x, you can see the horizontal
  motion</span> <span m='334980'>component.</span> </p><p><span m='335730'>Let's
  plot that separately, x as a function of t.</span> </p><p><span m='339600'>And
  when we make that plot, you can</span> <span m='341460'>see that this is just
  a linear equation in time</span> <span m='345610'>where there is some initial
  condition,</span> <span m='347550'>x nought, and so that's the plot of x as a
  function of t.</span> </p><p><span m='352510'>And so we see three separate
  representations of this motion.</span> </p><p><span m='357470'>y as a function
  of x, y as a function of t, and x</span> <span m='365370'>as a function of
  t.</span> </p><p></p>
