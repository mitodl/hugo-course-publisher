title: 1.5 Instantaneous Velocity in 1D
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3430'>We've now described what we call the average velocity for a
  time</span> <span m='8039'>interval between when the runner started at time
  t</span> <span m='11190'>to a later time at t plus delta t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='13790'>And we described that as the component</span> <span
  m='16760'>of the displacement vector divided by the time interval</span> <span
  m='20410'>times a unit vector, i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='23540'>Now what
  we'd like to ask is a separate question.</span> </p><p><span m='25640'>So our
  question now is, what do we</span> <span m='27370'>mean by the velocity at
  some specific time, T1?</span> </p><p><span m='39210'>Now in order to
  understand that, let's just</span> <span m='41560'>make a plot of the position
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='45270'>So remember we called the component of
  the position</span> <span m='48140'>function x of t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='49570'>So we're going to plot the component of the position</span> <span
  m='52660'>function with respect to time.</span> </p><p><span m='55920'>Now
  let's just say that the runner started</span> <span m='58410'>at the origin of
  time equal 0.</span> </p><p><span m='60050'>So I can make some type of
  arbitrary plot of that position</span> <span m='64560'>function.</span>
  </p><p><span m='65410'>And let's indicate in particular, the time T1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='71260'>So what this represents is x of T1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='76690'>And so first I'd like to consider the interval T1</span> <span
  m='80450'>and T1 plus some later time, delta T.</span> </p><p><span
  m='85080'>So let's make this T1 plus delta t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='90670'>This is the time delta t and up here</span> <span m='96220'>we have
  our position function at T1 plus delta T.</span> </p><p><span m='101170'>Then
  for this time interval, the average velocity,</span> <span m='105090'>so for
  this particular time interval,</span> <span m='107690'>the average represents
  delta x over delta t.</span> </p><p><span m='114500'>So it's just rise over
  run.</span> </p><p><span m='119100'>It's just the slope of this straight
  line.</span> </p><p><span m='123380'>So for this particular interval, the
  average</span> <span m='126970'>is the slope of the line shown here on the
  figure.</span> </p><p><span m='136090'>Now this is just an average
  velocity</span> <span m='138350'>and now what we would like to do is shrink
  down</span> <span m='141320'>our interval delta T. So now let's make another
  case where</span> <span m='147470'>we shrink delta t and let's again
  calculate</span> <span m='152840'>the average velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='153990'>So for instance, suppose we have a smaller delta t</span> <span
  m='159050'>and we draw that line.</span> </p><p><span m='161520'>Then our
  average velocity represents that slope.</span> </p><p><span m='168360'>And
  again, we keep on taking a limit.</span> </p><p><span m='170840'>So now we
  have another slope so we have one slope, two slopes,</span> <span
  m='175420'>and now we shrink again to a new delta t</span> <span
  m='179430'>and you can see that the slope is changing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='183760'>And if we consider the limit as delta t</span> <span
  m='188690'>goes to 0 of this sequence of slopes,</span> <span m='194210'>then
  what are we getting, you can see graphically,</span> <span m='197640'>that
  eventually we will get to a line which</span> <span m='204190'>is the slope of
  the tangent line at time T1.</span> </p><p><span m='217480'>And so in this
  particular case, what</span> <span m='220200'>we mean by the instantaneous
  velocity, v at time T1,</span> <span m='226560'>is the limit as delta x goes
  to 0 i hat here</span> <span m='231620'>where we're taking, this is the
  limit,</span> <span m='235340'>delta t goes to 0 x at T1 plus delta t minus
  x1</span> <span m='241750'>of t divided by delta t and the whole thing is a
  vector, i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='248480'>So what a limit is, is a
  sequence of numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='253510'>So we take a fixed delta
  t, we calculate the slope.</span> </p><p><span m='257660'>We take a smaller
  delta t, calculate the slope.</span> </p><p><span m='260930'>And each time we
  do that, the slopes represent</span> <span m='263250'>a sequence of numbers
  and the limit of that sequence</span> <span m='266520'>you can see
  graphically, is the slope</span> <span m='269120'>of the tangent line at time
  t 1.</span> </p><p><span m='271850'>And so what we say is, v of T1 is the
  instantaneous velocity</span> <span m='284300'>at time t equals t1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='288140'>And that's how we describe instantaneous
  velocity</span> <span m='292650'>at some specific time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='294590'>If we were now being a little bit more general,</span> <span
  m='297460'>we could just say that v at any time t</span> <span m='301180'>is
  the limit delta t goes to 0 delta</span> <span m='304630'>x over delta t ball
  direction i hat,</span> <span m='308460'>and the only thing here is we're no
  longer considering</span> <span m='311210'>T1 but an arbitrary time t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='314730'>This quantity, the limit, is awkward to write every
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='318460'>It has a name.</span> </p><p><span
  m='319680'>And that's precisely what we call the derivative</span> <span
  m='324400'>of the position function.</span> </p><p><span m='326780'>So our
  instantaneous velocity is the time derivative</span> <span m='330250'>of the
  position function at any instant in time.</span> </p>
