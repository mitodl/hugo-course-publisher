transcript: >-
  <p><span m='464'>There's an important distinction to make</span> <span
  m='2130'>between cause and effect when analyzing</span> <span m='4170'>the
  motion of objects.</span> </p><p><span m='5830'>There are two very separate
  questions that we can ask.</span> </p><p><span m='9110'>The first is, how does
  a particular object move?</span> </p><p><span m='12670'>This is a purely
  descriptive geometrical question</span> <span m='15140'>that we're
  asking.</span> </p><p><span m='16520'>What does the geometry of the motion
  look like?</span> </p><p><span m='19290'>If we were to draw its
  trajectory</span> <span m='20750'>as a function of time, what's the shape of
  that trajectory?</span> </p><p><span m='24630'>The study of the geometry of
  motion of a trajectory</span> <span m='27510'>is referred to as
  kinematics.</span> </p><p><span m='30380'>The second question we can ask is,
  why does an object</span> <span m='33200'>move the way it does?</span>
  </p><p><span m='35320'>Why does the kinematic description of the
  trajectory</span> <span m='37950'>look the way it does?</span> </p><p><span
  m='39690'>This concerns what the causes are of the motion</span> <span
  m='42280'>and of the changes in that motion.</span> </p><p><span m='44700'>The
  study of the cause behind the changes of motion</span> <span m='48040'>is
  called dynamics.</span> </p><p><span m='51020'>Newton's Second Law of Motion
  connects these two questions.</span> </p><p><span m='54120'>When we write F
  equals ma, this is more than just</span> <span m='56940'>a mathematical
  identity.</span> </p><p><span m='58840'>Physically, we're connecting two very
  different questions.</span> </p><p><span m='62090'>And we can symbolize that
  by dividing the equation</span> <span m='64400'>into its two sides.</span>
  </p><p><span m='66080'>The right-hand side, the ma side,</span> <span
  m='69220'>is essentially asking the question of how, how</span> <span
  m='71990'>does the object move?</span> </p><p><span m='73560'>What does that
  motion look like?</span> </p><p><span m='75710'>It's a description, a
  geometric description</span> <span m='77680'>of the object's motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='79970'>The left-hand side of the equation, where the forces
  are,</span> <span m='83060'>answers the question of why, why does the
  object</span> <span m='85880'>move the way it does?</span> </p><p><span
  m='87340'>What causes the motion to change?</span> </p><p><span
  m='90289'>These are very different conceptually.</span> </p><p><span
  m='92500'>And the remarkable thing about Newton's Second Law, in fact,</span>
  <span m='95280'>one of Newton's signature accomplishments</span> <span
  m='97170'>was to realize that these two questions can</span> <span
  m='99789'>be connected in this way through Newton's Second Law of
  Motion.</span> </p><p><span m='104080'>Since these are very different
  issues,</span> <span m='106570'>we'll examine them separately in our
  course.</span> </p><p><span m='109350'>We'll begin this week by looking at
  kinematics in one and two</span> <span m='112410'>dimensions, basically
  learning how</span> <span m='114630'>to describe the geometric motion of an
  object</span> <span m='117340'>and its trajectory.</span> </p><p><span
  m='119620'>We'll follow that by discussing the dynamics of the motion,</span>
  <span m='122600'>examining why an object's motion changes when forces are
  applied</span> <span m='126740'>through a discussion of Newton's laws and
  their applications.</span> </p><p></p>
