You are in a car standing by a traffic light and at time \\(\\displaystyle t=0 \\) the light turns green. You start to accelerate during the first \\(\\displaystyle t\_1 \\) seconds so that the acceleration of your car is given by:

| \\(\\displaystyle a\_1(t) = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} b\_1 & \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq t\_1 \\\\ 0 & \\quad t\_1 < t \\leq t\_2 \\end{array} \\right. \\) |   

where \\(\\displaystyle b\_1 \\) is a positive constant.

At the instant the light turns green a cyclist passes through the intersection moving with a speed \\(\\displaystyle v\_0 \\) in the same direction as your car is moving. At that instant, the cyclist starts to brake with a constant acceleration of magnitude \\(\\displaystyle b\_2 \\). At time \\(\\displaystyle t = t\_2 \\) the cyclist stops at the same location where you are.

The goal of the problem is to calculate the value of \\(\\displaystyle b\_2 \\) in terms of the given variables, \\(\\displaystyle b\_1 \\), \\(\\displaystyle v\_0 \\), \\(\\displaystyle t\_1 \\) and \\(\\displaystyle t\_2 \\).

**First:** Describe the motion of the car. Given the car's acceleration \\(\\displaystyle a\_1(t) \\), find its velocity and its position as a function of time:

**(Part b)** Calculate \\(\\displaystyle x\_1(t) \\) , the car's position as a funcion of time. Express your answer in terms of \\(\\displaystyle t \\), \\(\\displaystyle t\_1 \\), and \\(\\displaystyle b\_1 \\) as needed.

**Second:** Describe the motion of the bicycle. Given the bicycle's acceleration \\(\\displaystyle a\_2(t) \\), find its velocity and its position:

**(Part c)** Calculate \\(\\displaystyle v\_2(t) \\) , the bicycle's velocity as a funcion of time. Express your answer in terms of \\(\\displaystyle t \\), \\(\\displaystyle b\_2 \\), \\(\\displaystyle v\_0 \\) as needed.

**(Part d)** Calculate \\(\\displaystyle x\_2(t) \\) , the bicycle's position as a funcion of time. Express your answer in terms of \\(\\displaystyle t \\),\\(\\displaystyle b\_2 \\), and \\(\\displaystyle v\_0 \\) as needed.

**Third:** Find the value of \\(\\displaystyle b\_2 \\). We know that the bicycle stops at \\(\\displaystyle t=t\_2 \\), this condition is expressed as:

\\(\\displaystyle v\_2(t\_2) = 0 \\) (eq. 1)

We also know that the bicycle and the car are at the same location when the bicycle stops. This condition implies:

\\(\\displaystyle x\_2(t\_2) = x\_1(t\_2) \\) (eq. 2)

Use (eq.1) and (eq. 2) to obtain the value of \\(\\displaystyle b\_2 \\). Express your answer in terms of \\(\\displaystyle t\_1 \\), \\(\\displaystyle b\_1 \\), and \\(\\displaystyle v\_0 \\). Do not use \\(\\displaystyle t\_2 \\) in your answer.
