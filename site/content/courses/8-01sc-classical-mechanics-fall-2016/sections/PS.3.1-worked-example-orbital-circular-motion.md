A person on a spherical asteroid of mass \\(\\displaystyle m\_1\\) and radius \\(\\displaystyle R\\), sees a small satellite of mass \\(\\displaystyle m\_2\\) orbiting the asteroid in a circular orbit of period \\(\\displaystyle T\\).

Express you answer in terms of some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle m\_1\\),\\(\\displaystyle m\_2\\), \\(\\displaystyle \\pi\\), \\(\\displaystyle T\\), and the universal gravitational constant \\(\\displaystyle G\\).

**(Part a)** What is the radius \\(\\displaystyle r\_{\\text {sat}}\\) of the satellite's orbit?

**(Part b)** What is the magnitude of the velocity of the satellite?

Express you answer in terms of some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle m\_1\\), \\(\\displaystyle m\_2\\), \\(\\displaystyle \\pi\\), \\(\\displaystyle T\\), and the universal gravitational constant \\(\\displaystyle G\\).

----------------------------------

**(Part c)** If the asteroid rotates about its axis with a period \\(\\displaystyle T\_{\\text {a}}\\), at what radius must the satellite orbit the asteroid so that the satellite appears stationary to the person on the asteroid?

Express you answer in terms of some or all of the following: \\(\\displaystyle m\_1\\), \\(\\displaystyle m\_2\\), \\(\\displaystyle \\pi\\), \\(\\displaystyle T\_ a\\), and \\(\\displaystyle G\\).
