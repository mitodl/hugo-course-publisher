title: 32.3 Worked Example - Angular Momentum About Different Points
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3520'>I'd like to now calculate the angular momentum of a
  two</span> <span m='5890'>particle system.</span> </p><p><span m='7220'>So
  here's one particle.</span> </p><p><span m='8380'>Call that 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='9730'>And here's the other particle 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='11300'>And particle 1 has a momentum in the downward direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='15730'>And particle 2 has a momentum in the upper
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='19430'>Now, in this case, I want to make
  some of the momentum--</span> <span m='23410'>so this momentum of the system
  is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='27070'>And now I want to calculate the angular
  momentum</span> <span m='29560'>about two different points.</span>
  </p><p><span m='31370'>So let's just draw an axis here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34150'>And let's choose one point A. And we'll call this distance r,</span>
  <span m='39220'>and this distance r.</span> </p><p><span m='40540'>And let's
  choose another point B,</span> <span m='42460'>and we'll call that distance
  d.</span> </p><p><span m='44650'>Now, in order to calculate angular momentum
  of the system,</span> <span m='48380'>I need to draw my vectors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='51820'>Let's start with the angular momentum</span> <span
  m='54010'>about the point A. That's going to be a vector from A to
  object</span> <span m='59140'>1, cross the momentum of 1, plus the vector from
  A to object 2,</span> <span m='66070'>cross the momentum of 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='68510'>Now what's crucial here, is at this point,</span> <span
  m='71440'>things are a little bit of a abstract,</span> <span m='73640'>but we
  want to draw these vectors, rA1 and rA2.</span> </p><p><span m='77710'>So
  we're now constructing our angular momentum diagrams.</span> </p><p><span
  m='81340'>So there's rA1, and there rA2.</span> </p><p><span m='86440'>but
  again, in order to calculate this,</span> <span m='89060'>we could do it
  geometrically with right hand rules,</span> <span m='91510'>but I now want to
  introduce unit vectors,</span> <span m='94280'>so I can do vector
  decomposition at every point.</span> </p><p><span m='97600'>So I'm going to
  choose a unit vector, i-hat, j-hat,</span> <span m='102460'>and k-hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='104550'>And now I can decompose all of these vectors</span>
  <span m='107800'>in terms of my unit vectors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='109420'>This is the angular momentum of the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='112250'>So now it's not hard at all to write these out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='115020'>rA1 is minus r in the i-hat direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='121620'>Cross P1 is down.</span> </p><p><span m='124030'>That's minus P1 in
  the j-hat direction,</span> <span m='127540'>where P1 is the magnitude
  .</span> </p><p><span m='129820'>And rA2 is in the plus i-hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='133370'>So that's r i-hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='136090'>And I'm crossing that with P2, which</span> <span
  m='139480'>I'll write right now as P2 in the j-hat direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='144650'>Now remember, P2 has the same magnitude as P1,</span>
  <span m='152650'>but they're pointing in opposite directions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155930'>So when I take the cross project,</span> <span
  m='157780'>i-hat cross j-hat is k-hat minus sign minus sign.</span>
  </p><p><span m='161930'>So I get rP1 k-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='164650'>And
  now over here, P2 is equal to P1.</span> </p><p><span m='169510'>i-hat cross
  j-hat is k-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='171820'>And I get another rP1
  k-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='176320'>And so I have 2rP1 k-hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='179890'>And that's the angular momentum of the system about
  point A.</span> </p><p><span m='184300'>Now I'd like to calculate the angular
  momentum about B So</span> <span m='188560'>let's draw the same diagram, 1,
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='193610'>Here is P2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='196300'>Here's P1.</span> </p><p><span m='197980'>Here is B. And now I'll
  draw my vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='202870'>This is rB2 and this is
  rB1.</span> </p><p><span m='210610'>This distance was 2r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211840'>This distance was d.</span> </p><p><span m='214120'>I'm going to
  use the same unit vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='216800'>And so I get l for
  the system about B. Again,</span> <span m='221140'>I'll just write everything
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='222910'>P1 plus rB2 cross P2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='228310'>So I'm going to write P2 as, in this case,</span> <span
  m='232910'>it's equal to minus P1.</span> </p><p><span m='234910'>And
  magnitudes P2 equals P1.</span> </p><p><span m='237790'>In magnitude
  directions are opposite.</span> </p><p><span m='240160'>So rB1 is equal 2r
  plus D i-hat, and it's pointing</span> <span m='249220'>in the minus i-hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='252440'>Cross P1 is in the minus j-hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='257839'>rB2 is also in the minus i-hat
  direction,</span> <span m='262010'>so that's minus D i-hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='264760'>And P2 is in the plus j direction, so that is
  plus--</span> <span m='271600'>the magnitudes are the same--</span> <span
  m='273670'>P1 j-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='275420'>We don't need the plus
  sign there.</span> </p><p><span m='279460'>And now I take the cross
  products.</span> </p><p><span m='282280'>i-hat cross j-hat is k-hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='285790'>A minus sign minus sign.</span> </p><p><span
  m='287950'>That makes plus.</span> </p><p><span m='288730'>So I have 2r plus D
  P1 k-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='292990'>Now notice here I have i-hat cross
  j-hat, which is k-hat,</span> <span m='297720'>but there's a minus
  sign.</span> </p><p><span m='299510'>So I have minus D P1 k-hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='303570'>Here I have plus D P1 k-hat minus D1 P k-hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='307640'>And so I get 2rP1 k-hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='311430'>And I have the same result. L system A equals L system B.</span>
  </p><p><span m='320550'>Now that's not a coincidence in this problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='323860'>And the reason is that whenever--</span> <span
  m='326890'>so we can say it this way.</span> </p><p><span m='328980'>Whenever
  the momentum of the system is 0,</span> <span m='335460'>then LA is
  independent of the choice of the point A.</span> </p><p><span m='350260'>So
  coming back to our example, no matter where</span> <span m='352750'>I picked
  our points A and B--</span> <span m='355540'>any point I could pick, anywhere
  I want--</span> <span m='357470'>I could pick a point C up there--</span>
  <span m='359050'>I make this cross product calculation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='361180'>I would get exactly the same answer, 2rP1k.</span> </p><p></p>
