transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3190'>Let's consider examples of our principle</span> <span
  m='6640'>that the external torque about a point, s,</span> <span
  m='10360'>causes the angular momentum of a system to change about s.</span>
  </p><p><span m='16270'>We've examined central force problems</span> <span
  m='18550'>in which we chose the point s to be the central point in
  which</span> <span m='22300'>there was no torque.</span> </p><p><span
  m='23700'>Now, as examples, let's look at a case</span> <span m='26590'>where
  we have a pivoted object.</span> </p><p><span m='31450'>So I could take an
  example of an object.</span> </p><p><span m='36020'>Let's see, this will be
  overhead view of a ring of radius r.</span> </p><p><span m='46070'>And I'm
  going to have a mass coming in.</span> </p><p><span m='50090'>I'll call this
  ring mass m1, this object m2.</span> </p><p><span m='56430'>This object is
  coming in with an initial velocity,</span> <span m='59390'>and this is my
  pivot point.</span> </p><p><span m='64910'>Now, when the object m2 is hitting
  the ring,</span> <span m='71380'>we have a force, F2 on 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='75610'>This is the collision.</span> </p><p><span m='79720'>Here's our
  pivot point.</span> </p><p><span m='81420'>And when this hits the ring,
  we'll</span> <span m='83710'>have some type of pivot force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='86890'>I'm just going to denote the pivot force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='90250'>We're not quite sure what it will point at,</span>
  <span m='92560'>but I'll just say F pivot, for the moment,</span> <span
  m='96820'>is holding this point in place.</span> </p><p><span m='99820'>At the
  same time, the object will have a force, F1,2,</span> <span m='108250'>acting
  on the object.</span> </p><p><span m='110380'>Here is our pivot point,
  p.</span> </p><p><span m='114860'>And now, what point should we--</span> <span
  m='118050'>should we choose to see if there's no torque [? about? ?]</span>
  <span m='120960'>Suppose we choose the pivot point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='130360'>Well-- p.</span> </p><p><span m='133090'>Well, clearly, the pivot
  force has no torque about the pivot,</span> <span m='139900'>because the
  vector from the pivot point to where</span> <span m='141970'>the pivot force
  is acting is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='145450'>Remember, pivot forces have no
  torque about the pivot point.</span> </p><p><span m='148630'>However, this
  collision force will produce</span> <span m='152140'>a torque about the
  pivot.</span> </p><p><span m='155494'>And that's-- the angular momentum of the
  ring is not</span> <span m='157660'>constant, because the ring will start to
  rotate.</span> </p><p><span m='161650'>Similarly, this object is
  reversing--</span> <span m='164590'>will reverse directions, or will do</span>
  <span m='166180'>something due to the collision.</span> </p><p><span
  m='167890'>And again, this force will produce a torque that's equal</span>
  <span m='171700'>and opposite to the torque on the ring.</span> </p><p><span
  m='174820'>This is the torque on the particle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='177040'>But if we make our system equal to the particle and the
  ring--</span> <span m='186430'>so we'll call this, our system is now both the
  particle</span> <span m='190270'>and the ring--</span> <span m='191590'>then
  these torques are internal, and because they're</span> <span m='195760'>equal
  and opposite forces, the rs vector</span> <span m='199210'>is exactly the same
  rs vector.</span> </p><p><span m='201579'>The internal torques cancel in
  pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='204040'>The pivot force produces no
  torque.</span> </p><p><span m='206620'>So the torque on the system about the
  pivot is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='212200'>And that tells us that the angular
  momentum</span> <span m='215530'>of the system about that pivot point,</span>
  <span m='218500'>initially, will be equal to the angular momentum</span> <span
  m='222280'>about that pivot point, finally, if we take</span> <span
  m='225130'>two initial and final states.</span> </p><p><span m='228280'>In
  particular, suppose our initial state is--</span> <span m='234300'>here's the
  pivot.</span> </p><p><span m='236730'>Our object is coming in, that was m2
  vi.</span> </p><p><span m='243790'>The moment arm is r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='246394'>And our vector from here to the object, rs initial,</span> <span
  m='253570'>has a moment component that way.</span> </p><p><span m='256329'>If
  we put these vectors tail to tail</span> <span m='259420'>and figure out that
  the angular momentum is pointing</span> <span m='265000'>in this direction, l
  initial i, and the moment arm is r,</span> <span m='277350'>then the initial
  angular momentum about this pivot point</span> <span m='284140'>is just due to
  this moving object.</span> </p><p><span m='286630'>So that's m2 vi, and the
  moment arm is r,</span> <span m='293080'>and we'll denote its direction that
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='296150'>Now, the final angular momentum--</span>
  <span m='299650'>let's imagine that it sticks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='303010'>So we have m2, pivot, and now our ring</span> <span m='309490'>is
  going to be rotating with some omega final</span> <span m='312650'>because
  this object hits it.</span> </p><p><span m='315180'>And notice that this
  object is a distance</span> <span m='319210'>root 2 r from the pivot
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='325190'>So the final angular momentum can be two
  different pieces.</span> </p><p><span m='331810'>You can think of this as a
  system, where</span> <span m='334990'>we have I of the system about p times
  omega final,</span> <span m='340960'>because now it's just a rigid
  body.</span> </p><p><span m='343870'>And the angular momentum of the
  system</span> <span m='347080'>is consisting of two pieces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='349439'>It's the angular momentum of the ring</span> <span
  m='350980'>about the pivot, plus the angular</span> <span m='353740'>momentum
  of the particle about the pivot, times omega final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='364700'>Now, this is the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='368360'>This is the pivot point, p.</span> </p><p><span m='370760'>The
  angular momentum of the ring is the angular momentum</span> <span
  m='374960'>about the center of-- we'll use the parallel axis theorem--</span>
  <span m='377540'>angular momentum about the center of mass,</span> <span
  m='379820'>plus the distance from the center of mass</span> <span
  m='382850'>to the parallel axis, which is a distance, r.</span> </p><p><span
  m='387650'>So the first piece is Icm ring plus m r squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='394367'>And the angular momentum about the particle,</span>
  <span m='396200'>this is going in a circle of radius r2--</span> <span
  m='399560'>root 2r, so when we square that--</span> <span m='402380'>by the
  way this was, mass of the ring was 1.</span> </p><p><span m='405560'>Mass of
  the particle was m2 times r squared,</span> <span m='409560'>which is this
  distance squared, which is</span> <span m='412130'>2 r squared times omega
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='417970'>The moment of inertia of the ring</span>
  <span m='419930'>is m1 r squared about the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='423410'>We have the factor 2.</span> </p><p><span m='424700'>We have
  another factor of 2.</span> </p><p><span m='426780'>And so we get m1 plus m2
  times a factor 2 r</span> <span m='433770'>squared omega final, which we can
  call omega</span> <span m='437300'>f, pointing out of the board.</span>
  </p><p><span m='441590'>And so now, we have an angular momentum
  condition,</span> <span m='445430'>which is that m2 vi r equals 2 m1 plus m2
  r</span> <span m='454790'>squared omega final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='457520'>And that is the statement that the initial angular</span> <span
  m='460430'>momentum of our system--</span> <span m='461659'>the ring is at
  rest here--</span> <span m='463250'>is equal to the final angular momentum of
  the system, where</span> <span m='466190'>m2 is stuck to the ring, and
  they're</span> <span m='468020'>all rotating about this pivot point with omega
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='471800'>That's the angular momentum of the
  system</span> <span m='473570'>about p, omega final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='475070'>This is the initial angular momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='476810'>And so I can conclude that omega final is m2 vi over 2</span> <span
  m='484220'>m1 plus m2 times r.</span> </p><p></p>
