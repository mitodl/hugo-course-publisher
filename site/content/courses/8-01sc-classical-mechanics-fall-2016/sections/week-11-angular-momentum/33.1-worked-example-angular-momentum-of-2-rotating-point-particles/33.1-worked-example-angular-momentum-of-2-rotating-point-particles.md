title: 33.1 Worked Example - Angular Momentum of 2 Rotating Point Particles
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3490'>Let's look at the angular momentum</span> <span m='4930'>of
  two particles, one sitting here and one over there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='10480'>And they are circling each other.</span> </p><p><span m='13310'>And
  we want to determine the angular</span> <span m='14920'>momentum of a point on
  the ground right here underneath.</span> </p><p><span m='20350'>That's the
  whole point, s.</span> </p><p><span m='23490'>And here is the center.</span>
  </p><p><span m='25090'>So the circle has radius, R. And here we have a height,
  h.</span> </p><p><span m='34810'>and let's have the particles go
  counterclockwise.</span> </p><p><span m='40570'>Because then we can define our
  k hat vector to go up.</span> </p><p><span m='45460'>And if these particles
  are going this way,</span> <span m='48070'>then omega is also going to be
  going in the k hat direction--</span> <span m='55660'>in the positive k hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='59150'>So we know that L equals r cross
  p.</span> </p><p><span m='65110'>So we need to determine where is r and what's
  going on with p.</span> </p><p><span m='69640'>So our r vector goes here from
  point s to our first particle,</span> <span m='80370'>rs1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='82380'>And here is number two.</span> </p><p><span m='84300'>And we have
  rs2 sitting over here.</span> </p><p><span m='91890'>And p, the momentum of
  the particles-- well,</span> <span m='94710'>if these guys going in the
  counterclockwise direction,</span> <span m='99900'>then the momentum of
  particle one</span> <span m='102479'>is going to go into the board
  following</span> <span m='105300'>the direction of the motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='108120'>And here p2 is going to come out of the board.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114780'>If we consider this equation here,</span> <span
  m='116640'>we can already graphically determine</span> <span m='118530'>what
  the answer is actually going to be.</span> </p><p><span m='121050'>And so we
  do r cross p.</span> </p><p><span m='125520'>So r cross p, which means L. Ls1
  is going</span> <span m='132030'>to point in this direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='134952'>Ls1.</span> </p><p><span m='137460'>And alternatively,
  Ls2 is going to go</span> <span m='142860'>this direction, which means if we
  add these two components--</span> <span m='151540'>and we do want the total
  angular momentum of the system</span> <span m='154480'>of both
  particles.</span> </p><p><span m='156140'>So we have to add them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='157420'>We'll get here our L of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='164990'>So in order to calculate that, we</span> <span
  m='166930'>need to calculate first the Ls1 and then the Ls2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='170070'>And then we need to add them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='172480'>The crucial point here is to be careful</span> <span
  m='175480'>with the coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='177520'>For the
  first particle, k is going up.</span> </p><p><span m='182500'>And r is going
  outwards.</span> </p><p><span m='186160'>And theta hat is going into the
  board.</span> </p><p><span m='189400'>Then we can write up Ls1 equals rs1
  cross p1.</span> </p><p><span m='199720'>And we can express this vector here
  with h and with r.</span> </p><p><span m='204970'>So we have R in the r hat
  direction</span> <span m='210040'>plus h in the k hat direction cross
  p.</span> </p><p><span m='219250'>And p is the mass of the particle times the
  angular</span> <span m='223660'>velocity, the component.</span> </p><p><span
  m='225850'>That is R omega z.</span> </p><p><span m='227980'>And that goes in
  the theta direction.</span> </p><p><span m='232060'>So we need to solve this
  cross product here.</span> </p><p><span m='236790'>And we're going to have mR
  squared omega z.</span> </p><p><span m='242410'>And then we have r hat cross
  theta hat.</span> </p><p><span m='245410'>That's k hat plus hmR omega
  z.</span> </p><p><span m='252580'>And then we have k hat cross theta
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='255790'>That's anti-cyclic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='256930'>And we get an r hat.</span> </p><p><span m='259570'>And this is, by
  the way, an r1.</span> </p><p><span m='260922'>And this is another r1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='261880'>And we get a minus because it's anti-cyclic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='264810'>So we're going to turn this here into a minus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='268570'>And that is the angular momentum for our first
  particle.</span> </p><p><span m='273970'>Now we're going to do the same in an
  analogous</span> <span m='276940'>way for particle number two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='279970'>But again, we need to look at the coordinate
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='283690'>That's very crucial here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='285430'>So k hat still goes up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='288400'>r hat now goes into the other direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='293650'>And accordingly, theta hat comes out of the board.</span>
  </p><p><span m='297220'>And then we can just write down our Ls2 here as the
  same thing,</span> <span m='303930'>mR squared omega z k hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='309050'>And here we have minus hmR omega z r2 hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='319330'>And we know from our setup here that r1 equals minus
  r2 hat.</span> </p><p><span m='328150'>r1 hat equals minus r2 hat,
  which</span> <span m='331480'>means when we now put it all together,</span>
  <span m='334710'>we want L equals Ls1 plus Ls2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='341950'>We can tally this up.</span> </p><p><span m='343409'>And from this,
  we will see that the r hat term actually</span> <span m='350500'>falls
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='352480'>And we are left with 2 times the first
  term.</span> </p><p><span m='356380'>So we have 2mR squared omega z k
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='363910'>And that's exactly what we wanted.</span>
  </p><p><span m='366020'>We wanted an L pointing in the k hat direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='369700'>That's exactly this here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='371890'>And what you can also see is that the 2m here</span> <span
  m='375670'>is the mass, the total mass of the system, namely</span> <span
  m='378400'>two particles.</span> </p><p><span m='380410'>We could add
  another--</span> <span m='381892'>we could do the same exercise again</span>
  <span m='383350'>for four points because we'll add two here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='387070'>Then we would get 4m here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='388690'>So this is the mass of the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='395090'>And if we were to add many, many more points all along the
  rim</span> <span m='398740'>here, we get to a solid ring, which</span> <span
  m='401500'>means that either we know the total mass of the ring</span> <span
  m='404409'>that we could stick in here.</span> </p><p><span m='406460'>Or we
  can integrate along the rim</span> <span m='409120'>and then get to the total
  mass here.</span> </p><p><span m='410800'>And we'll always get to the same
  kind of form.</span> </p><p></p>
