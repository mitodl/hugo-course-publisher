title: 34.2 Torque Causes Angular Momentum to Change - System of Particles
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3330'>Let's now consider the generalization of the result</span>
  <span m='7290'>that the torque on a single particle about a point</span> <span
  m='9780'>causes the angular momentum of that particle about that point</span>
  <span m='12330'>to change to a collection of particles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='15160'>So let's begin by indicating some ith particle with momentum</span>
  <span m='21280'>Pi and some jth particle over here with momentum Pj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='28830'>And this is a big system of n particles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='33150'>And we'd like to calculate the angular</span> <span
  m='34830'>momentum about some point, s.</span> </p><p><span m='38400'>So that
  angular momentum will consist of the direct product</span> <span m='42450'>of
  the vector from s to the ith particle</span> <span m='47240'>and the direct
  product of the vector r s to the jth particle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='53070'>So the angular momentum, total, will</span> <span m='58290'>be the
  sum over all the particles, 1 to n,</span> <span m='62910'>of this sum, rsj
  cross Pj.</span> </p><p><span m='70890'>Now, what we'd like to do is, again,
  as before,</span> <span m='74670'>take the time derivative of this angular
  momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='79110'>We have the sum--</span> <span
  m='80810'>j goes from 1 to n.</span> </p><p><span m='82140'>We have two
  derivatives here, by the product rule,</span> <span m='87860'>cross Pj, plus
  the sum, j goes from 1 to n of rsj,</span> <span m='96539'>cross Fj, where we
  use the fact, as we did before,</span> <span m='104110'>that the force on the
  jth particle</span> <span m='107350'>is equal to the change in momentum of the
  jth particle.</span> </p><p><span m='112940'>Now, this first piece, again, the
  derivative</span> <span m='116800'>of the vector from s to the jth part is the
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='121460'>So we have j equals 1 to n of
  v--</span> <span m='126530'>the velocity of the jth particle--</span> <span
  m='129070'>cross Mj, Pj.</span> </p><p><span m='132340'>And that's 0, as we
  know that a vector cross product</span> <span m='136690'>with itself is
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='138640'>And this piece in here--</span> <span
  m='141000'>now, we have to be a little bit careful--</span> <span
  m='143470'>but rsj cross Fj is the torque on the jth particle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='153250'>So that is the torque on the jth particle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='158380'>Now, remember that we showed that internal-- the
  forces</span> <span m='164710'>on the jth particle could be both due</span>
  <span m='167230'>to internal or external forces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='169650'>And as long as the internal forces</span> <span m='172030'>pointed
  between two particles--</span> <span m='174640'>pointed along the line
  connecting those particles,</span> <span m='177400'>the internal torques
  cancel in pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='179800'>And this will only be the
  external torque.</span> </p><p><span m='182750'>So we've assumed that the
  internal torques</span> <span m='188520'>cancel in pair.</span> </p><p><span
  m='195630'>And that has to do with an assumption about the direction</span>
  <span m='198160'>of the internal forces.</span> </p><p><span m='199660'>And so
  we can conclude that this is just</span> <span m='203170'>the total external
  torque about the point s, s total.</span> </p><p><span m='211329'>And we'll
  drop that total, and we'll</span> <span m='213400'>conclude that the torque
  for our system of particles</span> <span m='217990'>is just-- causes the
  angular momentum of the system</span> <span m='221560'>of particles to
  change.</span> </p><p><span m='223570'>The calculation is exactly like the
  single particle,</span> <span m='226270'>with a few subtleties that have to do
  with internal torques</span> <span m='229480'>canceling in pairs.</span>
