  <p><span m='3800'>When we analyzed a single particle motion-- say,</span>
  <span m='6350'>we have an object, which is moving with momentum p--</span>
  <span m='9920'>then we have two principles.</span> </p><p><span m='11550'>Our
  Newton's second law told us that the force on the object</span> <span
  m='15650'>causes the momentum to change.</span> </p><p><span m='18530'>And
  now, what we'd like to do is consider another principle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='21930'>Suppose we're looking at some point about s.</span> </p><p><span
  m='26780'>We'd like to show that the torque about s</span> <span m='30440'>is
  equal to the change in angular momentum</span> <span m='32930'>of the particle
  about s.</span> </p><p><span m='35480'>So let's now investigate that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='38120'>Well, recall that angular momentum is defined</span>
  <span m='41810'>to be about a point, a vector s, and will indicate m</span>
  <span m='46730'>to show that this is the vector from s to where</span> <span
  m='49760'>the object is located cross the momentum of the object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='54720'>And what we want to now calculate</span> <span
  m='56780'>is the time derivative of that quantity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='61680'>Well, when you take the time derivative of a vector product,</span>
  <span m='65000'>it's the product rule.</span> </p><p><span m='66590'>And so
  there's two terms here.</span> </p><p><span m='68090'>It's drs/mdt cross p
  plus rsm cross dp/dt.</span> </p><p><span m='80720'>Now, no matter what the
  point s is,</span> <span m='84020'>the derivative of the vector that's</span>
  <span m='87170'>measuring where s to the mass is is always</span> <span
  m='89930'>the velocity of the object.</span> </p><p><span m='92460'>So that's
  the velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='93650'>And momentum is just mass times
  the velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='96660'>And you can see that that quantity
  is 0</span> <span m='98990'>because a vector direct product with its cross
  product</span> <span m='101900'>with itself is 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='103970'>And this second term--</span> <span m='105920'>notice that we have
  dp/dt in here.</span> </p><p><span m='109340'>And it's always crucial to
  understanding</span> <span m='111110'>these calculations where the second law
  comes in.</span> </p><p><span m='114920'>This is just rsm cross f.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120080'>And recall that when we talk about the torque</span>
  <span m='123110'>on an object about the point s by the action</span> <span
  m='127490'>of, say, some force.</span> </p><p><span m='130280'>And so suppose
  we had a force acting on this object.</span> </p><p><span m='135000'>And
  that's going to cause the object</span> <span m='137630'>to change its
  direction by some amount delta p.</span> </p><p><span m='143110'>Then the
  torque, by definition, is rsm cross the force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='149990'>And we see that that is exactly equal to the change in
  angular</span> <span m='155510'>momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='156540'>And
  so for a single particle, the torque about a point</span> <span m='160160'>s
  causes the angular momentum about that point to change.</span> </p><p><span
  m='165260'>And this result will generalize for a collection of
  particles</span> <span m='170300'>in a calculation that's very simple.</span>
