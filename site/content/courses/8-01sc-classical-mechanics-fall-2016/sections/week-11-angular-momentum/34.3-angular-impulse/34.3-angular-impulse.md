title: 34.3 Angular Impulse
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3640'>Let's consider the motion of a single particle</span> <span
  m='6490'>moving with a velocity v in a ground reference frame, say.</span>
  </p><p><span m='10510'>Recall that we defined the momentum of this object as
  mv.</span> </p><p><span m='15545'>And we know that Newton's second law</span>
  <span m='18130'>can be written in terms of the change of momentum
  dp/dt.</span> </p><p><span m='22910'>And when we integrated Newton's second
  law,</span> <span m='25520'>for impulse causes the integral of ADP</span>
  <span m='30760'>from some time t prime equals 0 to some time t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='35380'>So we're integrating t prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m='37150'>And here, we're taking your momentum</span> <span m='39640'>from
  some initial momentum to some momentum at time t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='44530'>We have that the impulse causes the momentum</span> <span
  m='49270'>of this single particle to change.</span> </p><p><span m='51670'>And
  in particular, this is what we call impulse.</span> </p><p><span m='56470'>And
  if the impulse is 0--</span> <span m='59170'>so as an example, if the impulse
  fdt prime equals 0,</span> <span m='66700'>that tells us that the momentum of
  our particle</span> <span m='70660'>has not changed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='73580'>Now, let's consider our same thing for angular momentum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='77530'>The only difference is that we choose some point
  s.</span> </p><p><span m='82710'>And we'll write the vector rs to where the
  object is.</span> </p><p><span m='86830'>And our angular momentum we defined
  about the point</span> <span m='89860'>s was the vector from s.</span>
  </p><p><span m='92110'>And we can indicate maybe to the mass m.</span>
  </p><p><span m='95170'>So it's a vector from s to where the object is located
  cross</span> <span m='99100'>the momentum of the object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='101450'>And this is how we define the angular momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='104350'>And recall that our basic concept</span> <span m='107410'>is that
  the torque about s causes the angular</span> <span m='111220'>momentum about s
  to change for this single particle.</span> </p><p><span m='115509'>Now, torque
  is if there's a force acting on the particle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='119530'>So for instance, if the force were acting at some angle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='125170'>Not only does the force change cause the momentum to
  change,</span> <span m='128620'>but we know that if there's a torque about
  s,</span> <span m='130887'>it will cause the angular momentum of the
  particle</span> <span m='132970'>to change too.</span> </p><p><span
  m='134260'>Now, let's talk about the angular impulse,</span> <span
  m='137230'>which is integrating the torque from</span> <span m='140650'>say
  some time t prime equals 0 to some time t.</span> </p><p><span m='145390'>And
  that's the integral of the angular momentum about s.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150460'>And now we're integrating this from some initial angular</span>
  <span m='153950'>momentum to some final angular momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='156530'>And just as before, we have that the angular impulse</span> <span
  m='167390'>will result in a change of angular momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='171470'>And in particular, if our angular impulse is 0,</span> <span
  m='182950'>that implies that the angular momentum of this particle</span>
  <span m='187810'>is constant.</span> </p><p><span m='189960'>And so you can
  see the analogies.</span> </p><p><span m='192070'>The important fact to
  realize is that in the reference frame,</span> <span m='195820'>momentum does
  not depend on any point,</span> <span m='198100'>but our angular momentum does
  depend</span> <span m='201010'>on the choice of the point s.</span>
  </p><p><span m='202970'>And in particular, in terms of the impulse, the torque
  about s</span> <span m='208480'>is also a quantity that depends on s.</span>
  </p><p><span m='211786'>And so that's the analogy between momentum</span>
  <span m='214120'>of a single particle and angular momentum of a single
  particle.</span> </p>
