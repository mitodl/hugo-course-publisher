  <p><span m='3430'>So I would now like to consider systems</span> <span
  m='7930'>in which the total momentum of the system is zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='11950'>And show that L, the angular momentum,</span> <span
  m='16620'>is independent of the choice of point A. So let's</span> <span
  m='27310'>consider this.</span> </p><p><span m='28280'>Let's draw a picture
  here and let's</span> <span m='30760'>make our system a bunch of discrete
  particles, particle</span> <span m='33280'>one particle two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='35250'>And let's call this the j-th particle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='38620'>And let's just choose a point A right here,</span>
  <span m='43200'>and let's choose a point B right there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='46690'>And I'll show that L for this system about A</span> <span
  m='51760'>is going to be equal to L of the system about B.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56860'>In order to make an angular momentum diagram</span> <span
  m='59890'>we have the momentum Pj of this particle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='66070'>And likewise, for all the other particles.</span> </p><p><span
  m='69940'>And I'll draw a vector R A,j Likewise,</span> <span m='75130'>for B
  I'll draw the vector R B,j.</span> </p><p><span m='80050'>And I'm also going
  to draw a vector from B</span> <span m='84610'>to A. I'll make that
  capital.</span> </p><p><span m='87130'>This vector is a constant because the
  points A</span> <span m='91900'>and B, here, A and B are fixed points.</span>
  </p><p><span m='100520'>Now let's calculate the angular momentum</span> <span
  m='103039'>about A for the system.</span> </p><p><span m='105530'>It's the sum
  of j goes from 1 to n of the vector R A,j cross Pj.</span> </p><p><span
  m='116360'>And I can use the angular momentum of the system about B</span>
  <span m='121405'>is j goes from 1 to n of R B,j cross Pj.</span> </p><p><span
  m='128810'>Now I'll use the vector triangle,</span> <span m='131120'>that the
  vector from B to j is equal to the vector from B</span> <span m='135096'>to A
  plus the vector from A to j.</span> </p><p><span m='138800'>So we have that R
  B,j is equal to the vector from B to A plus</span> <span m='146820'>the vector
  from A to j.</span> </p><p><span m='150140'>And I'll substitute that into our
  expression for the angular</span> <span m='152870'>moment about B. So the
  angular momentum about B is the sum j</span> <span m='158540'>goes from 1 to n
  of R B,A plus R A,j cross Pj.</span> </p><p><span m='168680'>Now the vector
  product distributes</span> <span m='171050'>over vector addition.</span>
  </p><p><span m='172050'>So this is two sums.</span> </p><p><span m='173690'>So
  let's write them both out.</span> </p><p><span m='175700'>J goes from 1 to n
  of R B,A cross Pj plus the sum j goes</span> <span m='184070'>from 1 to n of R
  A,j cross Pj.</span> </p><p><span m='190340'>Now already you're seeing that
  this term is the angular</span> <span m='194090'>momentum of the system about
  A. This term</span> <span m='197660'>is the interesting one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='199040'>R P,A is a constant vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='201660'>No matter which particle I choose,</span> <span m='203270'>one,
  two, the j-th particle, this vector is always the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='207810'>So I can pull it out of the sum and I get R B,A cross
  product</span> <span m='215630'>the sum of j goes from 1 to and of Pj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='220730'>Now we've already recognized this term</span> <span
  m='222800'>as the angular momentum of the system about A.</span> </p><p><span
  m='226646'>And this is just the total momentum of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='230760'>So we have equal to R B,A cross the total
  momentum</span> <span m='240240'>of the system plus the angular momentum of
  the system about A.</span> </p><p><span m='246000'>And that's the angular
  momentum of the system about B.</span> </p><p><span m='249750'>So this is our
  general result about how angular momentum</span> <span m='252930'>differ
  between two points.</span> </p><p><span m='254470'>But now, if P system equals
  to zero, the first term is zero,</span> <span m='262410'>then L of the system
  about B is equal to the L</span> <span m='268282'>of the system about A. We've
  proved our proposition</span> <span m='272070'>that if the total momentum of
  the system</span> <span m='273750'>is zero then the angular momentum
  doesn't</span> <span m='275909'>depend on the point we choose.</span>
  </p><p><span m='277980'>Now what's interesting here is that the reference
  frame moving</span> <span m='287960'>with the center of mass, by
  definition,</span> <span m='297270'>has P in that frame, let's call it the
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='302220'>And this is the cm frame is zero by
  definition.</span> </p><p><span m='308710'>So this is one more reason why the
  center of mass reference</span> <span m='311640'>frame is an important
  reference frame.</span> </p><p><span m='314400'>Because in the center of mass
  reference frame,</span> <span m='316380'>the total momentum, by definition, is
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='319350'>And therefore, the angular
  momentum</span> <span m='320880'>is independent of any point that you</span>
  <span m='322680'>choose in that reference frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='326160'>And so we can say that the system, when</span> <span m='328170'>we
  talk about a system's angular momentum,</span> <span m='331100'>we're
  referring to the angular momentum in the center</span> <span m='334740'>of
  mass reference frame.</span> </p><p></p>
