  <p><span m='3240'>Well, we've been calculating angular momentum about a
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='7730'>Recall our definition of angular
  momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='9480'>We've been looking at cases where the
  particle is</span> <span m='11521'>moving linearly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12580'>Now let's look at a case where the particles</span> <span
  m='14550'>are undergoing circular motion.</span> </p><p><span m='16260'>So
  suppose we have a particle that's</span> <span m='19320'>undergoing circular
  motion m.</span> </p><p><span m='23680'>And let's choose some axes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='28140'>And our particle, we denote that it's rotating</span>
  <span m='31860'>about the vertical axis.</span> </p><p><span m='33870'>I'm
  going to call that axis k hat.</span> </p><p><span m='36130'>And I'll make
  that omega squared, omega z positive.</span> </p><p><span m='41010'>So it's
  rotating about the k-axis, the z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='45910'>Now, when
  we calculate the angular momentum,</span> <span m='48700'>we know because it's
  rotating about the z-axis,</span> <span m='51330'>this is our z-axis, that the
  particle has a velocity</span> <span m='57030'>tangential to the
  circle.</span> </p><p><span m='58170'>So its momentum is tangential to the
  circle.</span> </p><p><span m='60840'>And we draw our vector rs to where the
  object is.</span> </p><p><span m='65519'>Now, you could solve this in
  Cartesian coordinates</span> <span m='70230'>but then you might have to do
  some vector decomposition.</span> </p><p><span m='72900'>But because there's a
  central point to this motion, whenever</span> <span m='76530'>there's a
  central point we like to choose</span> <span m='78690'>cylindrical
  coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m='80430'>And the way we'll do that is we'll
  define some angle theta.</span> </p><p><span m='83670'>If this were my plus x
  and my plus y-axis,</span> <span m='87510'>then that's consistent with k
  hat</span> <span m='89670'>being up in our definition of omega.</span>
  </p><p><span m='92640'>And I'll define an r hat unit vector,</span> <span
  m='95789'>which is pointing radially outward from the center</span> <span
  m='98340'>of the circle.</span> </p><p><span m='99360'>And a theta hat vector,
  which is tangent to the circle.</span> </p><p><span m='102570'>And now I can
  calculate--</span> <span m='103830'>I can write down, say the radius of this
  circle is r.</span> </p><p><span m='108960'>Then l of s, the vector rs has
  radius r pointing outward.</span> </p><p><span m='118170'>And the momentum
  vector is pointing tangential.</span> </p><p><span m='123870'>And that's a
  very easy cross-product to make r hat</span> <span m='127050'>cross theta
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='128669'>That's what we're defining to be k hat,
  maintaining</span> <span m='132330'>the cyclic order.</span> </p><p><span
  m='133970'>And so, we get rp k hat.</span> </p><p><span m='138180'>Now for
  circular motion the momentum magnitude</span> <span m='142410'>is m, the
  magnitude of the theta component.</span> </p><p><span m='144960'>We've made
  that positive, which is mr omega z.</span> </p><p><span m='149670'>And so ls
  is--</span> <span m='152400'>There's an r here and another r there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155310'>So we get mr squared times omega z k hat,</span> <span
  m='161700'>This is our vector omega.</span> </p><p><span m='163860'>Now this
  turns out to be the moment of inertia of a point</span> <span
  m='168000'>particle located at the center.</span> </p><p><span m='172530'>And
  so we conclude that the angular momentum</span> <span m='177329'>is
  proportional to the angular velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='181050'>Now,
  that's no surprise in this particular case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='184770'>Why?</span> </p><p><span m='185490'>Because the vectors rs and p
  are in the plane of motion.</span> </p><p><span m='189790'>And whenever you
  take a cross-product,</span> <span m='192720'>l is perpendicular to both of
  those vectors</span> <span m='196230'>so it's perpendicular to the plane of
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='198900'>And therefore, l has to point in the z
  direction.</span> </p>
