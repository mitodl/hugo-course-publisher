This is a summary of the main points from the lesson so far:

*   When an object rotates about a fixed axis that is not the axis of symmetry (such as an axis passing through one end of an object), the angular momentum about a point on the axis depends on the location of the point along the axis.
*   When an object rotates about a fixed axis that is not the axis of symmetry (such as an axis passing through one end of an object), the angular momentum is parallel to \\(\\displaystyle \\vec{\\omega }\\) only when calculated at the point of intersection between the axis of rotation and the object, \\(\\displaystyle \\vec{L}\_{intersect}=I\_{intersect}\\vec{\\omega }\\).
*   When a symmetric object rotates about the axis of symmetry, the angular momentum about a given point \\(\\displaystyle S\\) on the axis is \\(\\displaystyle \\vec{L}\_ S = I\_{cm}\\vec{\\omega }\\), independent of the location of point \\(\\displaystyle S\\).
