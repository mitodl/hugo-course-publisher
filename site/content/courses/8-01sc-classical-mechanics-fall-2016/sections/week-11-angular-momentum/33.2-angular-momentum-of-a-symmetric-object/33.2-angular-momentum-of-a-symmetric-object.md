title: 33.2 Angular Momentum of a Symmetric Object
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4190'>We'd like to now calculate the angular momentum</span> <span
  m='6380'>about an axis rotation of a symmetric object like a ring.</span>
  </p><p><span m='12110'>So here is our axis of rotation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='14270'>We're going to have omega pointing up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='16290'>That means omega's z will be positive, because that's</span> <span
  m='18920'>going to be our k hat axis.</span> </p><p><span m='20660'>And this
  is a ring of mass m and radius r.</span> </p><p><span m='25640'>So here's our
  radius.</span> </p><p><span m='27700'>Now, and we're going to choose a point
  that</span> <span m='30950'>lies somewhere on the symmetry axis of the
  ring.</span> </p><p><span m='34460'>And the object is rotating about that
  symmetry axis.</span> </p><p><span m='38030'>So it's passing through the
  center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='40230'>Now, the way we'll do this is
  we'll</span> <span m='42830'>divide our ring up into pairs of symmetric
  objects.</span> </p><p><span m='47040'>So we have an m here and a little delta
  m there.</span> </p><p><span m='51530'>And we're going to calculate the
  angular momentum</span> <span m='53970'>first of that pair.</span>
  </p><p><span m='55880'>Well, we've already made that calculation</span> <span
  m='58340'>that the angular momentum about s of the pair</span> <span
  m='61430'>is twice the mass of each object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='65120'>That's the mass of the pair times r squared</span> <span
  m='70640'>and it points in the omega direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='73940'>And so to get the angular momentum of the ring,</span> <span
  m='77060'>we'll just sum up a set of symmetric pairs</span> <span
  m='83120'>until we expand out over the entire ring.</span> </p><p><span
  m='86390'>And so L of the ring about s is just</span> <span m='90830'>the sum
  over the pairs of the mass of the pair</span> <span m='96590'>times r squared
  omega.</span> </p><p><span m='99080'>And r squared and omega are all
  constants.</span> </p><p><span m='103490'>The total mass of the ring is
  just</span> <span m='107660'>the sum over the pairs of the mass of the
  pair.</span> </p><p><span m='112350'>And that's the total mass m of the
  ring.</span> </p><p><span m='115450'>And so what we get is m r squared omega L
  of the ring s.</span> </p><p><span m='122960'>This is the moment of inertia
  about the axis for the ring,</span> <span m='127130'>because all the mass is
  distributed a distance r away.</span> </p><p><span m='131450'>And so we see
  for a continuous symmetric body like a ring,</span> <span m='135710'>again,
  because it's symmetric, the angular momentum</span> <span m='138620'>only has
  a component along the axis of rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='144210'>Now,
  what if we had an extended symmetric object?</span> </p><p><span
  m='149270'>And let's see if I can possibly draw something like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='154890'>So we'll draw a pear shaped object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='160370'>What is the moment of inertia of this pear shaped
  object, which</span> <span m='163790'>is intended to be symmetric, about the
  z-axis?</span> </p><p><span m='168560'>Well, I can think of that pear shaped
  object</span> <span m='172310'>as consisting of a ring and it's a solid
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='179350'>This is a solid symmetric
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='185680'>And then inside the ring is just more
  rings.</span> </p><p><span m='189900'>So the whole disk here is just a
  superposition of rings.</span> </p><p><span m='195390'>And so the moment of
  inertia--</span> <span m='196840'>so the angular momentum of just this
  disk</span> <span m='199680'>is the moment of the disk about the axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='203260'>And now I'll just add more disks that are
  symmetric.</span> </p><p><span m='209150'>And so by exactly the same
  calculation</span> <span m='211710'>as I have here, the moment of this
  symmetric object is just--</span> <span m='217320'>the moment of inertia is
  more complicated for this object.</span> </p><p><span m='220650'>And it points
  in the omega direction.</span> </p><p><span m='225090'>So again, in
  conclusion, a symmetric object</span> <span m='228660'>about the axis of
  rotation only has</span> <span m='231000'>a component of L pointing in the
  direction of omega.</span> </p><p><span m='234190'>The constant of
  proportionality between the angular momentum</span> <span m='238274'>and the
  angle the velocity is the moment</span> <span m='239940'>of inertia about that
  axis.</span> </p><p><span m='242300'>This we need to calculate for each
  symmetric object.</span> </p><p></p>
