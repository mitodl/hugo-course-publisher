title: 11.2 Worked Example - Car on a Banked Turn
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4150'>Let's consider the motion of a car on a circular
  track,</span> <span m='8490'>and the track is frictionless.</span>
  </p><p><span m='10570'>And it's also banked.</span> </p><p><span m='13090'>So
  this is the overhead view of our circular track.</span> </p><p><span
  m='17590'>It has radius, r.</span> </p><p><span m='19140'>And here's our car
  moving at a constant velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='23280'>Now, from the
  side view when we want to look at that bank</span> <span m='26930'>turn--
  let's draw a side view.</span> </p><p><span m='29340'>So here's our side view,
  and the car is moving with a velocity</span> <span m='38490'>into the plane of
  the figure.</span> </p><p><span m='40600'>Now this surface here is
  frictionless.</span> </p><p><span m='46410'>And what we'd like to do is find
  out</span> <span m='48130'>what speed the car can move such that it doesn't
  slide</span> <span m='52490'>up or down the inclined plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='54990'>So how should we analyze that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='56840'>Well our approach will be to apply Newton's second laws.</span>
  </p><p><span m='60240'>Now what's very important to realize</span> <span
  m='62110'>is this is circular motion.</span> </p><p><span m='64640'>And for
  circular motion we know that the car</span> <span m='67880'>is accelerating
  towards the center of the circle.</span> </p><p><span m='71250'>Now from the
  side view, towards the center of the circle</span> <span m='75020'>is in this
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='76510'>So the car is accelerating radially
  inward.</span> </p><p><span m='80550'>And that will guide how we choose our
  coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='84140'>And so we can then write our
  free body force diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='86690'>So let's begin with the
  analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='89070'>So we don't need to see the overhead
  view anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='93370'>So I'll just remove that, and then
  we can start drawing.</span> </p><p><span m='98990'>This is what we can refer
  to as our acceleration diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='102310'>And now let's
  draw the force diagram</span> <span m='105220'>on the car as our choice of
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='109660'>So here's our angle, phi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='111250'>Because the acceleration was inward</span> <span
  m='113759'>we're going to choose a radially outward coordinate</span> <span
  m='116570'>and a vertical coordinate, K hat up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='119090'>Notice that this is different than just a mass</span> <span
  m='121340'>on a fixed incline plane where we used unit</span> <span
  m='125020'>vectors up and down the inclined plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='127220'>The reason we choose our unit vectors</span> <span m='128880'>like
  that-- to emphasize it again,</span> <span m='130800'>is we already know this
  is constrain motion.</span> </p><p><span m='134120'>It's circular
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='135830'>Now what is the free body-- what are
  the forces on the car?</span> </p><p><span m='138700'>Well there is the normal
  force, the plane on the car,</span> <span m='142280'>and the gravitational
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='144500'>Now here-- whenever you're doing
  problems like this</span> <span m='147960'>remember that the trig is crucial
  to get</span> <span m='151180'>these angles right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='152380'>So that's phi, and that's phi, and that's our free body
  force</span> <span m='156320'>diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='157410'>And now
  we can write down Newton's second law.</span> </p><p><span m='160470'>So we'll
  start out with our usual approach,</span> <span m='165490'>and we have two
  directions that we have to consider.</span> </p><p><span m='169030'>So in the
  radial direction there is an inward component</span> <span m='171620'>of the
  normal force, like that.</span> </p><p><span m='175890'>And that's opposite
  the angle, so it's pointing</span> <span m='179380'>opposite our
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='181060'>So we have minus n sine phi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='184460'>The gravitational force is only in the negative K
  hat</span> <span m='186980'>direction.</span> </p><p><span m='187940'>And we
  know that the acceleration is inward,</span> <span m='191670'>and so there's a
  minus sign.</span> </p><p><span m='193730'>We have the mass, and the
  constraint for circular motion</span> <span m='197480'>is that that's phi
  squared over r.</span> </p><p><span m='200400'>Where r was the radius of that
  circle,</span> <span m='204350'>this can be thought of as the central
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='207140'>Now for the k hat direction, we
  have</span> <span m='209670'>a component of the normal force that's pointing
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='213715'>I'll just draw that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='215130'>That's adjacent to the angle, so we have plus and cosine
  phi.</span> </p><p><span m='220890'>And we have the gravitational force
  downward, minus mg.</span> </p><p><span m='227670'>And as far as the vertical
  direction</span> <span m='229710'>goes, because the car is going in a
  circle,</span> <span m='232060'>there is no acceleration up or down in the
  vertical direction.</span> </p><p><span m='235500'>Again, that's a constraint
  in this problem.</span> </p><p><span m='238280'>That's equal to 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='239610'>So in this problem, this is the side that we
  know,</span> <span m='243760'>and we're trying to figure out up to the speed,
  v. Now,</span> <span m='249350'>how do we analyze this problem?</span>
  </p><p><span m='250910'>Well you can see that if I write my two
  equations,</span> <span m='253860'>this n sine phi equals mv squared over
  r.</span> </p><p><span m='258980'>And cosine phi equals mg.</span>
  </p><p><span m='262680'>We have two equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='263820'>We have two unknowns, v and n.</span> </p><p><span m='265910'>Many
  times people just solve for n</span> <span m='268872'>and try to find the
  equation-- and then substitute in,</span> <span m='272530'>but you're also
  allowed to divide two equations,</span> <span m='276980'>and that's much
  easier.</span> </p><p><span m='278420'>The masses cancel and we get the
  relationship, that tan phi is v</span> <span m='284620'>squared over
  rg.</span> </p><p><span m='287240'>And so we have our result that the speed
  that the car can</span> <span m='294080'>travel on a frictionless inclined
  plane</span> <span m='298040'>and maintain uniform circular motion</span>
  <span m='300900'>is exactly the square root of rg tan phi.</span> </p><p><span
  m='305250'>And that's how we analyze the motion</span> <span m='307510'>of
  this car on a banked turn.</span> </p><p><span m='311430'>What we would now
  like to think about</span> <span m='313370'>is what would happen if you're
  traveling faster</span> <span m='315840'>or slower than this speed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='318660'>So suppose we have the prime bigger than the
  speed.</span> </p><p><span m='324410'>Now, what that means is that the car is
  going faster</span> <span m='330250'>and the new equilibrium-- if you asked
  what would the radius be</span> <span m='337270'>such that traveling at v
  primed the car</span> <span m='340610'>undergoes circular motion, the
  prime</span> <span m='343510'>would be equal to r prime g tan phi.</span>
  </p><p><span m='347520'>And so in order to go with this speed</span> <span
  m='350320'>you have to go at a greater radius.</span> </p><p><span
  m='353830'>Now what does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='355490'>Well, that
  means that if the car is traveling at v,</span> <span m='359570'>so it's in
  this circular motion, and now the driver increases</span> <span m='362870'>the
  speed to v prime, the car will</span> <span m='367220'>start to slide up the
  inclined plane-- remember,</span> <span m='371730'>it's frictionless-- until
  it reaches</span> <span m='375040'>a-- as it starts slide up the inclined
  plane</span> <span m='379560'>it will get to this new radius, r prime,</span>
  <span m='382250'>but because a car will have a little inertia it will</span>
  <span m='385020'>overshoot that speed, that radius,</span> <span
  m='388100'>and then it will start to come back down the inclined plane,</span>
  <span m='390810'>and it will oscillate about that point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='394540'>It won't be sinusoidal oscillations,</span> <span m='396960'>but
  they'll be a periodic oscillation</span> <span m='399560'>about this new
  radius, r prime.</span> </p><p><span m='403710'>The same thing, too, if we
  have the double prime less than d,</span> <span m='408990'>then the double
  prime is equal to r double prime G tan phi.</span> </p><p><span m='413900'>Now
  remember, this double prime is not two derivatives.</span> </p><p><span
  m='416930'>I'm just using that as a notation</span> <span m='418480'>to
  indicate different speeds.</span> </p><p><span m='420350'>So if the car is
  going along at speed, v, and slows</span> <span m='423530'>down, what would
  happen is the new equilibrium</span> <span m='426840'>radius is smaller so the
  car slides down the inclined plane</span> <span m='432770'>until it gets to r
  double prime.</span> </p><p><span m='434710'>It turns out that it will
  overshoot that a little bit,</span> <span m='437420'>and then start to move
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='439010'>And, again, it will oscillate around this
  new equilibrium</span> <span m='442070'>length.</span> </p><p><span
  m='442870'>So on a frictionless inclined plane</span> <span m='444750'>if you
  go faster then this speed the car slides up.</span> </p><p><span m='448240'>If
  you go slower than this speed, the car slides down.</span> </p><p></p>
