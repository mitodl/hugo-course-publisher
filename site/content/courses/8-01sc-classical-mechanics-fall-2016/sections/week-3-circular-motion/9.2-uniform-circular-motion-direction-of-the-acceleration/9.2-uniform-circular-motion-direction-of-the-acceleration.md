title: 9.2 Uniform Circular Motion - Direction of the Acceleration
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4290'>For a particle that's moving in a circle,</span> <span
  m='8280'>we found that when it's moving at a constant rate of d theta</span>
  <span m='15840'>dt--- and let's recall what we meant by theta of t--</span>
  <span m='20540'>and here's our particle, and we introduced our polar</span>
  <span m='24500'>coordinates r hat and theta hat, then we found that the
  velocity</span> <span m='29830'>was r d theta dt theta hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='34550'>And so let's assume that this quantity is
  positive,</span> <span m='38840'>in which case the velocity is pointing in the
  positive theta</span> <span m='41830'>direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='42800'>And that means that everywhere in the circle,</span> <span
  m='46660'>the velocity is tangential to the circle,</span> <span m='51820'>and
  the magnitude is a constant.</span> </p><p><span m='55670'>So for this case of
  uniform circular motion,</span> <span m='58560'>we calculated that the
  acceleration</span> <span m='61440'>was equal to minus r d theta dt quantity
  squared r hat, which</span> <span m='70350'>means that at every point, the
  acceleration vector is pointing</span> <span m='75470'>towards the
  center.</span> </p><p><span m='79060'>Now we can write that acceleration
  vector</span> <span m='82990'>as a component a of r-- r hat-- where this
  component is given</span> <span m='90420'>by r times d theta dt
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='92979'>It it's always negative, because when
  you square this quantity,</span> <span m='96630'>it's always a positive
  quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='98500'>The minus sign, just to remember--
  that</span> <span m='100770'>means that the acceleration is pointing
  inward.</span> </p><p><span m='103770'>Now how can we think about that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='106420'>Well, if we look at the velocity vector, what's
  happening here</span> <span m='110930'>is the velocity is not changing
  magnitude</span> <span m='112940'>but changing direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='114960'>And if you compare two points-- and let's</span> <span
  m='117750'>just pick two arbitrary points.</span> </p><p><span m='120040'>So
  let's remove this acceleration for a moment</span> <span m='124170'>and
  consider two arbitrary points-- say, a time t1 and t2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='130960'>So our velocity vectors are tangent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='133430'>The length of these vectors are the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='136020'>And if we move them tail to tail-- [? Vt2-- ?]</span> <span
  m='142440'>and take the difference, delta v, where</span> <span
  m='148570'>delta v is equal to v of t2 minus V of t1,</span> <span
  m='155250'>then we can get an understanding why the acceleration</span> <span
  m='158070'>is pointing inward, because recall</span> <span m='160340'>that
  acceleration by definition is</span> <span m='162810'>a limit as delta t goes
  to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='165980'>That means as this point
  approaches</span> <span m='167870'>that point of the change in velocity over
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='173090'>And so when we look at this limit</span>
  <span m='175730'>as we shrink down our time interval between t2 and t1,</span>
  <span m='181480'>then this vector will point towards the center</span> <span
  m='184940'>of the circle.</span> </p><p><span m='186100'>And that's why the
  direction of a</span> <span m='189074'>is in the minus r hat direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='193000'>Again, let's just recall that this is the case</span>
  <span m='196250'>for we called uniform circular motion, which</span> <span
  m='203510'>is defined by the condition that d theta dt is a constant.</span>
