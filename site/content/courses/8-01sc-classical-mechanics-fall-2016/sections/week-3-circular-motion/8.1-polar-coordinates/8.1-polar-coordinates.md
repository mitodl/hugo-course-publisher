title: 8.1 Polar Coordinates
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3770'>There are many physical problems in which a body
  undergoes</span> <span m='7060'>motion about a central point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='9770'>And when that happens, there's a natural coordinate
  system</span> <span m='12350'>to describe that motion, which in two
  dimensions</span> <span m='15150'>is polar coordinates.</span> </p><p><span
  m='16820'>So let's consider the orbit of an object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='19390'>For instance, the best example is a circular orbit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='22172'>If we have a circular orbit of an object,</span> <span
  m='24770'>there is a central point, which we'll call P.</span> </p><p><span
  m='27632'>Now given this type of motion with an object,</span> <span
  m='31920'>it naturally makes sense to choose a coordinate system</span> <span
  m='34770'>called polar coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m='36540'>The way that
  coordinate system works is as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='39200'>First
  off, we need to choose a reference angle.</span> </p><p><span m='42440'>And so
  we'll choose a horizontal line.</span> </p><p><span m='45510'>And we'll draw a
  ray.</span> </p><p><span m='47310'>And we'll show a direction of increasing
  reference angle</span> <span m='50880'>theta.</span> </p><p><span m='52140'>In
  this example, theta will go from 0 to 2 pi.</span> </p><p><span
  m='58650'>Along with the reference angle, we have a distance</span> <span
  m='61980'>from the central point.</span> </p><p><span m='63390'>And that
  distance we'll refer to as r.</span> </p><p><span m='66910'>So the coordinates
  of our point are r and theta.</span> </p><p><span m='70910'>Now the variable r
  is always greater than r</span> <span m='74960'>and can go to infinity--
  greater than 0.</span> </p><p><span m='78520'>So this is our polar coordinate
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='81990'>When you have a coordinate
  system,</span> <span m='83930'>remember, at every point in space,</span> <span
  m='86420'>there has to be unit vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='88440'>So at
  this point right here, how do we choose unit vectors</span> <span
  m='92830'>for polar coordinates?</span> </p><p><span m='95170'>We always
  choose the unit vectors</span> <span m='97240'>to point in the increasing
  direction of the coordinate.</span> </p><p><span m='101620'>Take the
  r-coordinate.</span> </p><p><span m='103030'>That increases radially
  outward.</span> </p><p><span m='105039'>So our unit vectors here will have a r
  hat</span> <span m='109390'>pointing radially outward.</span> </p><p><span
  m='112970'>What about the theta direction?</span> </p><p><span
  m='115660'>Tangential to the circle, in this particular case.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120940'>Because theta is increasing in this direction,</span>
  <span m='125390'>we choose our tangential unit vector,</span> <span
  m='129190'>which we're going to call theta hat, which is at right
  angles</span> <span m='132600'>to r hat, to point in the direction of
  increasing theta.</span> </p><p><span m='136460'>And so at this point, we now
  have a set of unit vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='141130'>Now one has to be
  very careful in polar coordinates</span> <span m='144170'>for the following
  reason.</span> </p><p><span m='145720'>Suppose that you're at another point
  over here.</span> </p><p><span m='149420'>Now because we have two different
  points,</span> <span m='151740'>let's just give some names to these
  points.</span> </p><p><span m='153660'>We'll call this s1 and this point
  s2.</span> </p><p><span m='157300'>And the unit vector's over here where r1
  and theta were.</span> </p><p><span m='161110'>When we're at the point as 2,
  we have</span> <span m='163300'>to choose unit vectors exactly the same
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='166240'>r hat 2 points in the direction of
  increasing r, and theta hat</span> <span m='172454'>2 points in the direction
  of increasing theta.</span> </p><p><span m='176290'>So what we see in polar
  coordinates</span> <span m='178210'>is that r hat 1 is not equal to r hat
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='182150'>Why are they not equal?</span> </p><p><span
  m='183420'>They both are unit vectors, so they both have</span> <span
  m='185720'>the same magnitude, but they point in opposite directions,</span>
  <span m='189950'>in the same way that theta hat 1 is not equal to theta hat
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='194660'>So unlike Cartesian coordinates, in which at
  every single point</span> <span m='197950'>had the same unit vectors, in polar
  coordinates,</span> <span m='201210'>the unit vectors depend on where you are
  in space.</span> </p><p><span m='204829'>And that will make our analysis on
  polar coordinates</span> <span m='207829'>a little bit more
  complicated.</span> </p><p></p>
