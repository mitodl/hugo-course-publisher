  <p><span m='3270'>Now we'd like to discuss angular acceleration</span> <span
  m='6790'>for circular motion.</span> </p><p><span m='8189'>So suppose we have
  our angle theta, radius r, and r hat</span> <span m='14260'>and theta
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='15710'>Recall that we described the angular
  velocity</span> <span m='20590'>as the derivative of d theta dt, and we made
  this perpendicular</span> <span m='25910'>to our right-handed coordinate
  system, direction k hat.</span> </p><p><span m='29920'>Now let's differentiate
  that to get our concept of angular</span> <span m='33240'>acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='34420'>So alpha is the second derivative d theta</span> <span
  m='37850'>dt squared k hat.</span> </p><p><span m='39740'>And this quantity is
  what we call angular acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='45340'>Now we'll
  describe the component alpha z</span> <span m='50110'>as d squared theta dt
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='52680'>So it's the second derivative of the
  angle.</span> </p><p><span m='54850'>And also if we wrote this as omega z k
  hat,</span> <span m='59130'>we can write that as the derivative of d omega z
  dt,</span> <span m='65900'>as well.</span> </p><p><span m='67240'>So this is
  the component.</span> </p><p><span m='71310'>And now in circular motion, the
  quantities of omega and alpha z</span> <span m='78090'>are very much like the
  linear quantities</span> <span m='81190'>of the x component of the
  velocity</span> <span m='83280'>and the x component of the
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='85770'>And again, when we've chosen a
  reference frame,</span> <span m='88610'>let's look at what various components
  mean.</span> </p><p><span m='91440'>Let's begin with the case 1 where omega z
  is positive.</span> </p><p><span m='97710'>So when omega z is positive,
  that</span> <span m='99830'>tells us that the angle d theta dt is
  increasing.</span> </p><p><span m='103800'>And that corresponds to
  counterclockwise motion.</span> </p><p><span m='107310'>Now given that case,
  let's look at what happens</span> <span m='112070'>when alpha z is
  positive.</span> </p><p><span m='115380'>Remember, that's the statement that d
  omega dt is positive,</span> <span m='121400'>that omega z is
  increasing.</span> </p><p><span m='123020'>So if an object is moving with a
  positive component of omega z</span> <span m='127540'>and the angular
  acceleration component is positive,</span> <span m='130759'>that corresponds
  to increasing.</span> </p><p><span m='133840'>The linear example, if you had
  one dimensional motion, i hat,</span> <span m='139220'>you had vx positive and
  a x positive,</span> <span m='143020'>corresponds to an object
  increasing</span> <span m='145910'>in its speed in the x direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='149290'>That's our first case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150910'>Now let's look at the second example</span> <span m='153420'>when
  alpha z is less than 0.</span> </p><p><span m='156130'>So now the derivative
  of d omega z dt is negative.</span> </p><p><span m='162320'>What that
  corresponds to-- remember,</span> <span m='164110'>omega z is the z component
  of the angular speed.</span> </p><p><span m='168930'>And if that's slowing
  down, then, with alpha z less than 0,</span> <span m='174670'>the object is
  slowing down.</span> </p><p><span m='178530'>So in our linear case, if we had
  a x less than 0,</span> <span m='184770'>this is the classic example of
  breaking.</span> </p><p><span m='187120'>The object is moving in the x
  direction and slowing down.</span> </p><p><span m='191630'>Now let's look at
  case 2.</span> </p><p><span m='194670'>This is always a little bit complicated
  for circular motion</span> <span m='197329'>where omega z is less than
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='200460'>In that case, the object is moving</span>
  <span m='202780'>in the clockwise direction because the angle</span> <span
  m='205590'>theta is decreasing, corresponding</span> <span m='209070'>to
  clockwise motion.</span> </p><p><span m='211329'>So in that case, once again,
  let's consider the two</span> <span m='214750'>examples.</span> </p><p><span
  m='215790'>Well, the first example is a positive component</span> <span
  m='220210'>of angular acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='222250'>Now this is
  the one that can be a little bit confusing.</span> </p><p><span m='226570'>The
  object is moving clockwise but it</span> <span m='229660'>has a positive alpha
  z, which will correspond</span> <span m='233300'>to slowing the object
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='236230'>And if the alpha z remains
  positive,</span> <span m='238410'>it will actually come to rest and then
  reverse its motion</span> <span m='242210'>and start to speed up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='244200'>So this is the case where d omega dz is
  increasing.</span> </p><p><span m='251930'>And that's our first case.</span>
  </p><p><span m='254850'>So something like that could correspond to,</span>
  <span m='258980'>if we plotted omega z and we had an object that</span> <span
  m='264210'>starts off with a negative omega z and increases.</span>
  </p><p><span m='269280'>Notice that the slope here, which is alpha z
  positive,</span> <span m='274020'>corresponds to a positive angular
  acceleration component.</span> </p><p><span m='278620'>And the object slows
  down as omega gets closer to 0,</span> <span m='283260'>stops, and now has a
  positive omega</span> <span m='286050'>z, corresponding to motion in a
  counterclockwise direction.</span> </p><p><span m='290130'>For our linear
  case, this corresponds</span> <span m='293120'>to, again, with i hat, our
  object moving to the left,</span> <span m='298530'>vx negative, and if a x is
  positive,</span> <span m='303560'>it breaks in this direction, which means
  it's slowing down.</span> </p><p><span m='307350'>And then eventually if alpha
  x, ax, stays positive,</span> <span m='311490'>it continues in that
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='313640'>Now our final case, and I'll put it
  down here,</span> <span m='316830'>b, this is again where omega z negative and
  alpha z negative.</span> </p><p><span m='325130'>It's always helpful to see
  this immediately with the graph.</span> </p><p><span m='328620'>Omega z is
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='330720'>Here, alpha z, which is the slope, is
  also negative.</span> </p><p><span m='336150'>This corresponds to an object
  moving</span> <span m='337960'>in the clockwise direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='340180'>And actually its speed is increasing</span> <span
  m='343520'>because alpha z is negative.</span> </p><p><span m='345750'>So it's
  going faster and faster in the clockwise direction,</span> <span
  m='349560'>even though alpha z is negative.</span> </p><p><span m='352360'>And
  for our linear case, again, this</span> <span m='355830'>corresponds to an
  object moving in the negative x direction.</span> </p><p><span m='360070'>And
  a x is negative, it's moving faster</span> <span m='363770'>in the negative x
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='365820'>And so these are the cases of
  how</span> <span m='367550'>we analyze the various cases for angular
  acceleration</span> <span m='374070'>and angular velocity.</span> </p>
