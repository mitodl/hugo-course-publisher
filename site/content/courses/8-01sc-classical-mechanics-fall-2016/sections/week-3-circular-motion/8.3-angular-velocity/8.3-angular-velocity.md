title: 8.3 Angular Velocity
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3770'>Now we'd like to talk about angular velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6830'>So for a particle traveling in a circle,</span> <span
  m='9020'>we've seen that the velocity can be written as r d theta dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='15840'>In the theta hat direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='18830'>And we've also seen that d theta dt can be positive,</span> <span
  m='24240'>in which case, theta is increasing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='25917'>And so the particle is traveling around the circle</span> <span
  m='28000'>in this direction.</span> </p><p><span m='29310'>You can call that
  the counterclockwise direction.</span> </p><p><span m='32270'>We've also seen
  that d theta dt can be negative, in which case</span> <span m='37760'>the
  angle is decreasing, so the particle's traveling around</span> <span
  m='40350'>the circle in this direction, which we could call clockwise.</span>
  </p><p><span m='44970'>Let's now look at rotation in an arbitrary
  plane.</span> </p><p><span m='48020'>So if I have a plane like this and
  I</span> <span m='51120'>have some particle traveling in a circle like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='56090'>And I have some observer that's above the
  plane</span> <span m='62260'>looking down on this plane, then it</span> <span
  m='65060'>will see this rotation as being in</span> <span m='68490'>the
  counterclockwise direction.</span> </p><p><span m='70500'>Whereas if I have
  another observer down here</span> <span m='74380'>and they're looking up at
  this plane,</span> <span m='76220'>they'll see the motion as being clock
  wise.</span> </p><p><span m='79890'>And so you can see we have a need</span>
  <span m='81450'>for the more formal definition for the rotation of
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='85070'>And so what we're going to do is use the
  right hand rule</span> <span m='88260'>to define a direction that tells
  you</span> <span m='90760'>both the direction it defines the plane</span>
  <span m='93250'>and it also tells you what the positive direction of
  rotation</span> <span m='96060'>is for that plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='98170'>So the way we'll do this right hand</span> <span m='99979'>rule is
  we'll take our right hand,</span> <span m='102920'>we'll curl our fingers in
  the direction of the rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='107190'>And our thumb
  will point in the direction</span> <span m='109670'>of the positive direction
  that we're defining.</span> </p><p><span m='113360'>So in this case, I'm going
  to have an arrow like this.</span> </p><p><span m='117235'>I'll call it n hat
  to indicate that it's the normal unit</span> <span m='119740'>vector to that
  plane.</span> </p><p><span m='122301'>All right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='122800'>Let's come back to this example now,</span> <span m='126120'>where
  the plane of the motion is this plane of the board.</span> </p><p><span
  m='130440'>And let's look at our two cases again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='132450'>So in the case of d theta dt positive, our circle</span> <span
  m='136410'>looks something like this.</span> </p><p><span m='139960'>And you
  can see that if I use my right hand rule,</span> <span m='144690'>the plane,
  the vector that I've defined, is out of the board.</span> </p><p><span
  m='148810'>And I'm going to use this symbol, a circle with a dot,</span> <span
  m='151520'>to indicate this direction of out of the board.</span> </p><p><span
  m='155140'>In our other case, for d theta dt less than zero,</span> <span
  m='160200'>our particle is traveling in this direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='164570'>And so you can see by my right hand rule</span> <span
  m='166670'>that now the direction that I've defined is into the board.</span>
  </p><p><span m='171560'>And for that, I'm going to draw this as an x in the
  circle.</span> </p><p><span m='175470'>So these are symbols that you'll
  see</span> <span m='177390'>throughout the rest of the course, the out of the
  board</span> <span m='180800'>and into the board symbols.</span> </p><p><span
  m='184300'>And so now, let's look back at our coordinate system</span> <span
  m='186930'>that we've defined.</span> </p><p><span m='187820'>We have r hat
  direction and a theta hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='191100'>And in
  this coordinate system, there's</span> <span m='193600'>a third direction
  that's defined,</span> <span m='195800'>which is the k hat direction, which
  you</span> <span m='198060'>can see is out of the board.</span> </p><p><span
  m='200000'>And so now, I'm going to define what we actually call</span> <span
  m='204520'>the angular velocity as omega.</span> </p><p><span m='208040'>And
  I'm going to write that as d theta dt.</span> </p><p><span m='210730'>Now, in
  the k hat direction, in this case,</span> <span m='214250'>it could be in an
  arbitrary n hat direction,</span> <span m='216543'>depending on what you're
  playing of motion is.</span> </p><p><span m='218460'>In this case, I'm going
  to call it in the k hat direction,</span> <span m='220876'>and now you can see
  that these signs are going to line up</span> <span m='225070'>with these
  directions.</span> </p><p><span m='227090'>So omega, as d theta dt k hat, when
  d theta d t is positive,</span> <span m='232850'>k hat is in the same
  direction as this unit</span> <span m='236490'>normal that we've defined that
  defines</span> <span m='238310'>both the plane of the motion and the direction
  of the motion.</span> </p><p><span m='241560'>And when d theta dt is negative,
  I</span> <span m='245120'>have that omega is in the negative k hat direction,
  which</span> <span m='248480'>is exactly this direction here that we've</span>
  <span m='250600'>defined as being the motion for this plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='253680'>And so this is how we define angular velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='257220'>So we can define d theta dt to be the component of the
  angular</span> <span m='262340'>velocity omega z, because it's in the k hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='267130'>And we can also define the angular
  speed,</span> <span m='270670'>which is just omega as being the absolute value
  of this angular</span> <span m='275140'>velocity omega.</span> </p><p><span
  m='276360'>So that is, in other words, it's just the absolute value</span>
  <span m='279420'>of the d theta dt.</span> </p><p><span m='282740'>So when a
  particle's undergoing circular motion,</span> <span m='285980'>it has a
  velocity that you can describe,</span> <span m='289020'>which is the
  tangential motion around the circle.</span> </p><p><span m='293290'>And it
  also has an angular velocity,</span> <span m='296880'>which we define as being
  in a direction that's</span> <span m='299040'>perpendicular to that direction
  of rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='302700'>And it's defined by the right hand
  rule.</span> </p><p><span m='305840'>And now that we have defined this omega
  z, the component</span> <span m='311690'>of the angular velocity, we can
  rewrite the velocity</span> <span m='315060'>as just being equal to r times
  omega z still</span> <span m='319230'>in that theta hat direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='321200'>And so this is another way that we can write the
  velocity</span> <span m='324230'>and connect it back to the angular
  velocity.</span> </p>
