title: 11.1 Newton's 2nd Law and Circular Motion
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3900'>Let's examine again an object that's</span> <span
  m='6540'>undergoing circular motion.</span> </p><p><span m='8610'>And we'll
  choose our polar coordinates r hat, theta hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='14160'>We'll make it cylindrical with a k hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='16710'>Now that we've completed our kinematic description</span> <span
  m='19920'>of the motion, now let's see how we apply Newton's second law</span>
  <span m='24430'>to circular motion.</span> </p><p><span m='28430'>Well, when
  we write Newton's second law as F</span> <span m='32320'>equals ma, that--
  remember, we can divide these two sides.</span> </p><p><span m='37680'>This
  side, the how, is a geometric description</span> <span m='42490'>of the
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='43770'>And this side is the why, and
  this</span> <span m='46420'>is the dynamics of the motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='49580'>And the dynamics come from analyzing the forces that</span> <span
  m='52630'>are acting on this object.</span> </p><p><span m='54780'>So when
  we're applying this mathematically</span> <span m='59050'>to circular motion,
  F equals ma-- this is a vector equation.</span> </p><p><span m='64720'>And so
  what we need to do is think about each component</span> <span
  m='68260'>separately.</span> </p><p><span m='69370'>Sometimes I can just
  distinguish the components</span> <span m='72820'>that I'm talking about over
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='75710'>And so we have that the radial component
  of the forces--</span> <span m='79440'>and that comes from an analysis of the
  dynamics,</span> <span m='82420'>the physics of the problem-- and this side is
  mass times</span> <span m='87750'>the radial component of the acceleration,
  ar.</span> </p><p><span m='92150'>Now these are very different things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='94320'>And it's by the second law that we're</span> <span
  m='97490'>equating in quantity these two components.</span> </p><p><span
  m='102500'>Now if we wrote that equation-- this side out in a little
  bit</span> <span m='106039'>more detail-- we'll save ourselves</span> <span
  m='108270'>a little space when we handle the tangential direction--</span>
  <span m='111430'>the forces come from analysis of free body force
  diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='115539'>And over here, we know the
  acceleration is always inward.</span> </p><p><span m='119430'>And I'll choose
  to write this as r omega squared.</span> </p><p><span m='124060'>And so this
  will be our starting point</span> <span m='126250'>for analyzing the radial
  motion for an object that's</span> <span m='131140'>undergoing circular
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='132870'>Now remember, there could be a
  tangential motion, too.</span> </p><p><span m='136430'>And in the tangential
  direction, the tangential forces</span> <span m='140610'>are equal to ma
  tangential.</span> </p><p><span m='143790'>And as we saw, this is again the
  second law,</span> <span m='146960'>equating two different things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='148720'>We have that we can write the tangential force as
  r</span> <span m='153520'>d squared theta dt squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='157170'>And sometimes we've been writing that as r alpha z.</span>
  </p><p><span m='163300'>But this equation here is what we're</span> <span
  m='166620'>going to apply for the tangential forces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='170320'>If the tangential forces are 0, then there's</span> <span
  m='173680'>no angular-- there's no tangential acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='177220'>We know that for circular motion,</span> <span
  m='179570'>the radial force can never be zero,</span> <span m='181360'>because
  this term is always non-zero</span> <span m='184160'>and points radially
  inward.</span> </p><p><span m='186410'>And now we'll look at a variety of
  examples</span> <span m='188730'>applying Newton's second law to circular
  motion.</span> </p>
