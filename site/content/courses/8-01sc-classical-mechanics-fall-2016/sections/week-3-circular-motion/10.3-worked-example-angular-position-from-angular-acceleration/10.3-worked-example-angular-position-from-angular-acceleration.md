  <p><span m='3620'>In kinematics, if we know acceleration,</span> <span
  m='6560'>which we generally can get from Newton's second law,</span> <span
  m='9220'>then we'd like to integrate the acceleration</span> <span
  m='11160'>to get velocity and position.</span> </p><p><span m='13250'>How does
  that work for circular motion?</span> </p><p><span m='16100'>Well, when you
  think about circular motion</span> <span m='18810'>and you think about the
  tangential direction,</span> <span m='23280'>then that, in some sense, is a
  one-dimensional motion.</span> </p><p><span m='27730'>And so what we'll see is
  that the tangential description</span> <span m='30830'>of this motion can be
  integrated to get the tangential velocity</span> <span m='34990'>and position,
  just in a similar way</span> <span m='38190'>that we did with linear motion,
  where</span> <span m='40400'>if we were given the acceleration,</span> <span
  m='42030'>we integrated velocity and position.</span> </p><p><span
  m='44890'>So let's look at a particular example.</span> </p><p><span
  m='47980'>Suppose we're given that the tangential component</span> <span
  m='50790'>of the acceleration is given by some simple polynomial, A</span>
  <span m='55210'>minus Bt.</span> </p><p><span m='57230'>Now, in this case, the
  acceleration</span> <span m='59140'>is certainly non-constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='61970'>What we'd like to do-- remember, this</span> <span
  m='63860'>is equal to rd squared theta dt squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='69090'>So if we integrate the tangential component</span> <span
  m='73180'>of the acceleration with some variable</span> <span m='76960'>from t
  prime going from some initial value, which</span> <span m='80730'>we can call
  0, to some final value,</span> <span m='83880'>then that will give us the
  change</span> <span m='87480'>in the tangential velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='90600'>So for this case, V theta of t is</span> <span m='94550'>equal to V
  theta t0 plus the integral of A minus B t prime</span> <span m='102660'>d t
  prime.</span> </p><p><span m='103890'>Now, we needed an integration variable
  because recall</span> <span m='107950'>that our functional dependence is the
  upper limit</span> <span m='110660'>of the integral.</span> </p><p><span
  m='111970'>We saw that in one-dimensional kinematics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='114060'>So we're going from some t0 0 to some prime t prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='119270'>Well, this integral is now-- we'll</span> <span
  m='121110'>write this V theta 0, where, again, t0 we're calling 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='127610'>And when we do this integral, A minus B t prime and
  d</span> <span m='131950'>t prime-- that's an integral from 0 to t prime
  equals t.</span> </p><p><span m='137780'>t prime equals 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='138760'>This integral is not hard to do.</span> </p><p><span m='140950'>We
  get A of t minus 1/2 B of t squared.</span> </p><p><span m='147020'>And
  there's that constant initial term.</span> </p><p><span m='150829'>And so the
  velocity at time t of the tangential component</span> <span m='156490'>of the
  velocity is given by that expression.</span> </p><p><span m='159930'>In
  exactly the same fashion, the angle-- how much angle</span> <span
  m='164390'>does this go through?</span> </p><p><span m='165990'>Well, we have
  to be careful there.</span> </p><p><span m='170640'>So if we want to do the
  arc length, s of t,</span> <span m='175520'>we have to multiply the angle by
  the radius.</span> </p><p><span m='178890'>And that is just the integral of
  the tangential component</span> <span m='183020'>of the velocity from t prime
  equal 0 to time t prime t.</span> </p><p><span m='189650'>And so in this
  example, we have a slightly complicated</span> <span m='192930'>integral, V0 d
  t prime, 0 to t.</span> </p><p><span m='198390'>I'm going to drop-- well, I'll
  write it</span> <span m='200300'>in-- t prime plus the integrals A t prime
  minus 1/2</span> <span m='207290'>B t prime squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='209550'>I didn't need to split this up.</span> </p><p><span m='212450'>But
  I'm splitting it up, anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='216550'>And I have really
  one, two, three integrals to do.</span> </p><p><span m='221420'>And what I get
  is V theta 0 t-- the result</span> <span m='227300'>of the first
  integral.</span> </p><p><span m='228520'>The result of the second interval is
  1/2 At squared.</span> </p><p><span m='233300'>And the result of the third
  integral</span> <span m='235090'>is minus 1/6 B t cubed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='240000'>And that gives me this.</span> </p><p><span m='242230'>I have to be
  a little careful on this side.</span> </p><p><span m='245370'>It's how much
  has the arc length changed as we go from time 0</span> <span m='254570'>to
  time t.</span> </p><p><span m='256060'>So that's the change in arc
  length.</span> </p><p><span m='263100'>And that's a typical example of where
  we're</span> <span m='265850'>given tangential acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='268390'>We integrate it to get the tangential velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='271530'>And then when we integrate the tangential
  velocity,</span> <span m='274140'>we're getting the change in arc length
  around the circle.</span> </p><p></p>
