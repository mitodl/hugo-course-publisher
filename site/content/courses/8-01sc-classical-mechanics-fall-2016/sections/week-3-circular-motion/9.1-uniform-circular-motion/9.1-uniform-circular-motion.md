title: 9.1 Uniform Circular Motion
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3990'>When we analyzed how the position vector changed,</span>
  <span m='7240'>we know that the velocity for circular motion</span> <span
  m='10790'>is given by the radius times the rate</span> <span m='13880'>that
  the angle is changing.</span> </p><p><span m='15460'>And it points tangential
  to the circle.</span> </p><p><span m='18000'>So let's draw a few
  characteristic arrows</span> <span m='20250'>to show that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='21090'>At this point, we'll draw these pictures with d theta dt</span>
  <span m='25710'>positive.</span> </p><p><span m='27090'>So the velocity points
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='29320'>It points like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='30335'>It points like that.</span> </p><p><span m='32400'>And
  these are all the velocity vectors at different times.</span> </p><p><span
  m='37330'>Notice that if we make-- consider the special case</span> <span
  m='44160'>in which d theta dt is a constant, in that instance,</span> <span
  m='52390'>the magnitude of the velocity, v,</span> <span m='55220'>is given by
  r magnitude of d theta dt.</span> </p><p><span m='58790'>And that is also a
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='62150'>But the velocity vector is changing
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='65830'>And we know by definition that the
  acceleration</span> <span m='69490'>is the derivative of velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='71740'>And so what we see here is where we</span> <span
  m='74530'>have a vector that's constant in magnitude but changing</span> <span
  m='78710'>direction.</span> </p><p><span m='79630'>And we now want to
  calculate the derivative</span> <span m='82280'>in this special case.</span>
  </p><p><span m='84630'>We refer to this case as uniform circular
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='88050'>So this special case is often called
  uniform circular motion.</span> </p><p><span m='95650'>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='96270'>How do we calculate the derivative of the velocity?</span>
  </p><p><span m='99570'>Well, recall that the velocity vector, r d theta</span>
  <span m='103720'>dt-- those are all constants-- because it's in the theta
  hat</span> <span m='107880'>direction, once again, will decompose theta
  hat</span> <span m='111610'>into its Cartesian components.</span> </p><p><span
  m='113640'>You see it has a minus i hat component and a plus j hat</span>
  <span m='116570'>component.</span> </p><p><span m='117580'>The i hat component
  is opposite the angle.</span> </p><p><span m='119880'>So we have minus sine
  theta of t i hat plus cosine</span> <span m='125170'>theta of t j hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='127970'>So when I differentiate the velocity in time,</span>
  <span m='131840'>this piece is constant, so I'm only again applying the
  chain</span> <span m='137570'>rule to these two functions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='139990'>So I have r, d theta dt.</span> </p><p><span m='143360'>And I
  differentiate sine.</span> </p><p><span m='144770'>I get cosine with a minus
  sign.</span> </p><p><span m='146960'>So I have minus cosine theta.</span>
  </p><p><span m='149140'>I'll keep the function of t, just so that you
  can</span> <span m='151450'>see that-- d theta dt i hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='155240'>Over here, the derivative of cosine</span> <span m='156750'>is
  minus sine d theta dt.</span> </p><p><span m='159050'>That's the chain rule--
  sign of theta dt, d theta dt, j hat.</span> </p><p><span m='165430'>And now I
  have this common d theta dt term,</span> <span m='168260'>and I can pull it
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='170160'>And I'll square it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='173150'>Now whether do you think that dt is positive or negative,</span>
  <span m='175890'>the square is always positive, so this quantity</span> <span
  m='178079'>is always positive.</span> </p><p><span m='181210'>And inside I
  have-- I'm also going</span> <span m='184070'>to pull the minus sign
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='187120'>And I have cosine theta of t i hat plus
  sine theta of t j hat.</span> </p><p><span m='194910'>Now what we have here is
  the unit vector r hat t.</span> </p><p><span m='199851'>r hat has a cosine
  adjacent in the i hat direction and a sine</span> <span m='206400'>component
  in the H Hut direction.</span> </p><p><span m='209170'>So our
  acceleration--</span> </p>
