title: Worked Example - Orbital Circular Motion â€“ Radius
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3330'>The little prince's asteroid B612</span> <span m='6750'>is
  being orbited by a small body.</span> </p><p><span m='10400'>It has a mass
  m.</span> </p><p><span m='12360'>And it goes around this asteroid B612 that
  has a mass m1.</span> </p><p><span m='21840'>We should add a coordinate
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='23520'>We always know about r-hat goes radially
  outward.</span> </p><p><span m='29140'>And we know from the universal law of
  gravitation</span> <span m='31800'>that we have mutual attraction between
  these bodies.</span> </p><p><span m='34470'>And actually, that's going to
  point inward.</span> </p><p><span m='38255'>And because we're having orbital
  motion here,</span> <span m='41060'>so circular motion, the
  acceleration,</span> <span m='44020'>the radial component of the
  acceleration</span> <span m='45840'>will also point inward.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49260'>We need to consider all of that for our f equals ma
  analysis</span> <span m='54320'>that we are going to do now, because the
  little prince wants</span> <span m='59000'>to know how far this little body is
  away from his asteroid.</span> </p><p><span m='65510'>So we have the
  gravitational universal law here,</span> <span m='71450'>minus Gmm1 over the
  distance squared.</span> </p><p><span m='79090'>So the distance here between
  the two planets,</span> <span m='81950'>r, which is what we want to
  calculate.</span> </p><p><span m='85400'>And then we have over here for
  circular motion,</span> <span m='89890'>the description of mr omega
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='94720'>Now, the little prince can't measure
  omega.</span> </p><p><span m='97700'>But the little prince has a little time
  clock.</span> </p><p><span m='101100'>So what he can measure is the period
  from here</span> <span m='105130'>until he sees the body again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='108520'>And that is 2pi over omega.</span> </p><p><span
  m='112200'>So we can add that in here.</span> </p><p><span m='115145'>mr 4pi
  squared over T squared.</span> </p><p><span m='122120'>And this m here will
  cancel out.</span> </p><p><span m='127335'>And we have to solve this for
  r.</span> </p><p><span m='130169'>What we're going to see--</span> <span
  m='132240'>Oh and of course, we have a minus sign</span> <span m='134160'>here
  because in the life of the little prince,</span> <span m='138460'>of course
  gravitational acceleration</span> <span m='141250'>is not going
  outwards.</span> </p><p><span m='142480'>It's going inward, so we better give
  this a minus here and here</span> <span m='146890'>as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='148130'>And we will actually see that that then</span> <span
  m='150490'>cancels out against this one.</span> </p><p><span m='152090'>And
  we're going to solve this for r.</span> </p><p><span m='154460'>So we get r
  cubed, actually.</span> </p><p><span m='158920'>And then we have Gm1 over 4pi
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='167340'>And here, we have T squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='170540'>And you can also just write that as Gm1 or pi squared
  T squared.</span> </p><p><span m='179950'>And then we have third root.</span>
  </p><p><span m='186640'>So you might have seen this equation here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='189590'>This is actually Kepler's law.</span> </p><p><span
  m='191480'>It describes the motion of the planets around the sun.</span>
  </p><p><span m='195240'>Well, it really only does it if the motions</span>
  <span m='197640'>are fairly circular.</span> </p><p><span m='198970'>For
  elliptical orbits, it is not such a good approximation,</span> <span
  m='202970'>although Kepler derived it like that quite a while ago.</span>
  </p><p><span m='207480'>And that was really an astonishing result.</span>
  </p><p><span m='209329'>So here, we have this again that the cube</span> <span
  m='211690'>of the distance between two objects</span> <span m='213900'>is
  proportional to the square of the period of the orbiting</span> <span
  m='218280'>time.</span> </p>
