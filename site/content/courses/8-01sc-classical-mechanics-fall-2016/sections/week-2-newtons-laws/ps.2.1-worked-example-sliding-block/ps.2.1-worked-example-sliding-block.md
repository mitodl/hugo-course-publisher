  <p><span m='3430'>Let's consider the following problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5410'>Suppose we have an inclined plane.</span> </p><p><span m='8830'>And
  on this inclined plane, we have a block.</span> </p><p><span m='14140'>And
  down here at the bottom of the inclined plane</span> <span m='16530'>is a
  little bumper.</span> </p><p><span m='18040'>It can be a spring of some
  type.</span> </p><p><span m='20270'>And what we have is the block is sliding
  down the inclined</span> <span m='23870'>plane, bouncing off the bumper, and
  sliding up</span> <span m='27390'>the inclined plane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='28749'>And what we'd like to do is find the acceleration</span> <span
  m='30790'>of the block for both cases.</span> </p><p><span m='33060'>So when
  it's sliding down, let's do an analysis on that motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='40252'>Well, the first thing we have to do</span> <span m='41710'>is,
  again, identify our system.</span> </p><p><span m='43720'>In this case, just
  the block will be our system.</span> </p><p><span m='47460'>So we'll put in
  the block as our system.</span> </p><p><span m='55350'>And now we have to
  analyze the forces on the block</span> <span m='58400'>as it's sliding
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='59870'>There is a friction with a coefficient mu
  k.</span> </p><p><span m='63820'>And so we have the gravitational force,
  mg.</span> </p><p><span m='69090'>We have a normal force of the surface</span>
  <span m='71710'>on the block pointing up.</span> </p><p><span m='73260'>And
  because the block is sliding down,</span> <span m='75870'>remember that our
  friction force is opposing that motion.</span> </p><p><span m='81720'>Now when
  you have a free body force diagram,</span> <span m='84920'>we have to decide
  how should we choose our coordinate systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='89440'>What we want to encourage you is not</span> <span m='91690'>to
  choose a coordinate system, unit vectors,</span> <span m='94270'>horizontal
  and vertical, just because that's the way</span> <span m='96580'>one always
  does it, but to use the constraints of the system</span> <span m='100580'>to
  help you choose the coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='102770'>Now a
  technique for doing that is to draw what you think</span> <span
  m='106789'>will be the acceleration on your sketch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='111120'>So I expect that a is going to go down the inclined plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='117000'>That's taking into account that there</span> <span
  m='119330'>is no motion perpendicular to the inclined plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='122641'>Drawing the acceleration-- remember,</span> <span
  m='124140'>acceleration is not a force-- but this gives me</span> <span
  m='127260'>a clue for how I should choose my unit vectors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='130780'>I'll choose them, so that I have points down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='134580'>And so I essentially have a one dimensional motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='137730'>And I'll choose j hat pointing out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='140660'>Now I'll introduce an angle theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='145260'>That's the same angle theta here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='148420'>And one has to be a little bit careful in doing</span> <span
  m='151810'>these types of sketches.</span> </p><p><span m='152829'>But this is
  also the angle theta.</span> </p><p><span m='156070'>And now I've chosen a
  coordinate system, unit vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='159790'>I've indicated
  relevant angles.</span> </p><p><span m='161322'>And the rest of the problem is
  just</span> <span m='162780'>vector decomposition in applying Newton's second
  law.</span> </p><p><span m='165990'>So we'll write down F equals m a.</span>
  </p><p><span m='169700'>And I'm going to indicate a d for we're</span> <span
  m='172270'>talking about the acceleration downwards.</span> </p><p><span
  m='174490'>And we have two directions to analyze,</span> <span m='176920'>the
  i hat and the j hat directions.</span> </p><p><span m='179540'>So in the
  direction tangent to the surface,</span> <span m='182980'>we have a
  gravitational force, downward, mg sine theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='188620'>We have the kinetic friction force opposing that motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='191860'>And that's equal to m a d, where a d is the x
  component</span> <span m='196829'>of the acceleration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='198440'>In the vertical direction, we have the normal force</span> <span
  m='201280'>minus m g cosine theta.</span> </p><p><span m='203860'>And here's
  where our choice of coordinate system helps us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='207860'>The constraint of the system is that a y</span> <span m='211630'>is
  0 when we choose y to be the perpendicular direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='216090'>So this side is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='218870'>Now I look at
  this, and I see a f and N.</span> </p><p><span m='223130'>And that's only two
  equations and three unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='225930'>But now I have a
  for slope for my friction, which</span> <span m='230300'>is that the kinetic
  friction is equal to a coefficient mu k N.</span> </p><p><span m='234980'>And
  I can see from this equation, that's mu k mg cosine</span> <span
  m='240190'>theta.</span> </p><p><span m='241460'>And now I'm in position in
  which to substitute</span> <span m='246550'>my friction into this equation and
  solve for the acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='251220'>Notice the mass
  will cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='254500'>And what I get is that the
  acceleration going down</span> <span m='259130'>is just equal to g times sine
  theta minus mu k</span> <span m='267500'>cosine of theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='270450'>And so that's how we can analyze the acceleration</span> <span
  m='275260'>when the block is sliding down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='277070'>Next, we want to analyze the acceleration</span> <span
  m='279600'>when the block is going up.</span> </p><p><span m='281500'>Now when
  you have a case like that,</span> <span m='284000'>it's sometimes easier,
  again, just to draw.</span> </p><p><span m='290870'>We'll still choose
  N.</span> </p><p><span m='294020'>Now, the interesting thing is, which
  way</span> <span m='297530'>is the acceleration pointing?</span> </p><p><span
  m='299080'>Just because the block is going up,</span> <span m='301830'>the
  acceleration is still pointing down.</span> </p><p><span m='303960'>How do you
  know that?</span> </p><p><span m='304900'>Well, we'll see that when we analyze
  the forces.</span> </p><p><span m='310070'>So we still have N. We have
  mg.</span> </p><p><span m='314410'>But now, the crucial point is-- this</span>
  <span m='316470'>is going up-- the crucial point here</span> <span
  m='320760'>is that the kinetic friction is always opposing the motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='324170'>So when the block of sliding up, the kinetic friction
  is down.</span> </p><p><span m='328940'>And all that we have is a sign change
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='332750'>This is now plus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='335020'>If I choose my i hat and j hat in the same direction,</span> <span
  m='340650'>notice both of these forces have a positive component</span> <span
  m='343150'>in the i hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='344130'>So the
  acceleration will be down.</span> </p><p><span m='345820'>And rather than do
  all the algebra, all I'm doing</span> <span m='348240'>is changing the
  sign.</span> </p><p><span m='349750'>And I get that a up is equal to g sign
  theta plus mu k cosine</span> <span m='358230'>theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='359430'>And although it may seem slightly counter-intuitive</span> <span
  m='362780'>that the acceleration as the block is going up in magnitude</span>
  <span m='366460'>is bigger than the acceleration as the block is going
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='371040'>And that's because of the
  direction</span> <span m='373080'>of the kinetic friction force.</span> </p>
