title: 6.2 Static Friction Lesson
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4350'>We considered a case where an object is moving</span> <span
  m='6480'>along the surface, but now let's consider what happens,</span> <span
  m='9810'>that if we apply a force here, and the object stays at rest.</span>
  </p><p><span m='16730'>Well, we still have the normal force</span> <span
  m='20580'>distributed over the surface.</span> </p><p><span m='22300'>But now
  because the object is at rest,</span> <span m='24990'>there is another kind
  the contact force now</span> <span m='28210'>is what we call static friction,
  the tangential part of that.</span> </p><p><span m='32890'>And the contact
  force is still the perpendicular part,</span> <span m='35470'>the normal
  force, plus the tangential part,</span> <span m='38520'>which we refer to as
  static friction.</span> </p><p><span m='43250'>Now what happens with static
  friction</span> <span m='46040'>is that if we don't apply a force at all,
  then</span> <span m='50280'>there is no static friction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='51550'>In fact, you can see in this simulation,</span> <span m='54200'>that
  if we slowly increase the applied force,</span> <span m='58100'>then the
  static friction force gets bigger and bigger.</span> </p><p><span m='60950'>It
  depends on what we're doing to the system.</span> </p><p><span m='65069'>But
  at a certain point, when we apply a large enough external</span> <span
  m='69850'>force, the object suddenly starts to slip.</span> </p><p><span
  m='73920'>That's what we call the just-slipping condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='76030'>And the reason for that is static friction</span> <span
  m='78240'>has reached its maximum possible value.</span> </p><p><span
  m='81110'>That has to do with the physics of the interaction</span> <span
  m='83990'>between the surface and the object.</span> </p><p><span m='87330'>So
  also, there's a very subtle thing,</span> <span m='91320'>is that as you see
  when we pull the force and it just slips,</span> <span m='95500'>suddenly the
  friction has gone from static</span> <span m='98130'>to kinetic friction, and
  it's gotten a little bit smaller.</span> </p><p><span m='101690'>How do we
  express those properties?</span> </p><p><span m='103580'>Well, what we have is
  the idea that the static friction can</span> <span m='109130'>vary in
  magnitude between 0 and some type of maximum value,</span> <span
  m='116380'>depending on the other constraints on the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120340'>And the maximum value of static friction,</span> <span
  m='124090'>we have a force law, which is that it's, again,</span> <span
  m='128009'>proportional to the normal force,</span> <span m='130720'>but the
  coefficient is called now the coefficient</span> <span m='134340'>of static
  friction.</span> </p><p><span m='136130'>And this coefficient of static
  friction</span> <span m='137990'>is slightly bigger than the
  coefficient</span> <span m='140690'>of kinetic friction, which explains</span>
  <span m='142620'>why that arrow got a little bit smaller when it just</span>
  <span m='146070'>started to slip.</span> </p><p><span m='148270'>Now again,
  like kinetic friction,</span> <span m='151310'>static friction is opposing
  this external force.</span> </p><p><span m='155910'>And depending on the
  direction that the object moves,</span> <span m='159470'>for instance, if we
  applied the external force</span> <span m='164870'>in the opposite direction,
  here, then the static friction</span> <span m='171290'>that's distributed over
  the surface is opposing that force.</span> </p><p><span m='176240'>But there
  may be many systems in which we're actually not</span> <span m='179590'>quite
  sure which way the static friction points.</span> </p><p><span m='183430'>And
  as the course develops and we</span> <span m='184940'>look at more complicated
  examples,</span> <span m='186770'>we'll see that the direction of static
  friction</span> <span m='190010'>can depend on all the other constraints on
  the system.</span> </p><p></p>
