title: Window Washer Free Body Diagrams
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3460'>Let's consider what we call the window washer
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='6430'>What we have is suspended from some
  ceiling.</span> </p><p><span m='9640'>We have a pulley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='11140'>And the pulley is suspended by a rope, which we're</span> <span
  m='15790'>going to call this string 3.</span> </p><p><span m='20060'>And we
  have a rope that is wrapping around this pulley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='25140'>And then it wraps around another pulley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='29400'>So this rope is going around another pulley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='32100'>And it's fixed to the ceiling.</span> </p><p><span m='36750'>And
  this is what we're going to call string 1.</span> </p><p><span m='41910'>And
  then this string, there's another string</span> <span m='45550'>that comes
  down to a platform.</span> </p><p><span m='52440'>And this one we're going to
  call string 2.</span> </p><p><span m='57290'>And sitting on the platform is a
  person.</span> </p><p><span m='61550'>So we have a person sitting on the
  platform.</span> </p><p><span m='65019'>And that person is pulling the rope
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='69470'>Now this is a very complicated
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='72340'>And it's a classic example of
  how</span> <span m='74640'>do we choose systems so that we can apply Newton's
  second law.</span> </p><p><span m='79330'>Now, one of the important things
  we're going to do</span> <span m='81539'>is learn to see when we choose a
  system what forces</span> <span m='85590'>are internal and external.</span>
  </p><p><span m='88090'>And that will enable us to pick a very nice system,
  which</span> <span m='92970'>will make the analysis easy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='95180'>The way we'll do this is will approach it in stages.</span>
  </p><p><span m='97820'>We'll first focus on the person, the platform, and this
  pulley.</span> </p><p><span m='102370'>By the way, this is pulley A. And this
  one is pulley B.</span> </p><p><span m='111370'>And let's use a symbol P for
  the platform.</span> </p><p><span m='116950'>And we'll call this a washer
  person.</span> </p><p><span m='122760'>And we're going to use the symbol W for
  the person.</span> </p><p><span m='125750'>So what makes this problem
  complicated</span> <span m='127620'>is all these different elements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='129949'>Now the first stage is that what we're going to
  do</span> <span m='133140'>is we're going to separately look</span> <span
  m='134930'>at the person, the platform, and then</span> <span
  m='138720'>combine them into a system of person and platform.</span>
  </p><p><span m='142190'>But notice, the rope is connected to the
  platform.</span> </p><p><span m='144800'>So the next stages will also
  consider</span> <span m='147640'>a system consisting of pulley A, person, and
  the platform,</span> <span m='152220'>and the washer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='153760'>Now let's draw the free body diagram.</span> </p><p><span
  m='156000'>Let's begin by drawing the free body diagram on the washer.</span>
  </p><p><span m='161400'>So what do we have on the washer?</span> </p><p><span
  m='165540'>The first thing to think about is the string.</span> </p><p><span
  m='168500'>The washer is pulling the string down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='171530'>So the string is pulling the washer up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='174710'>So that's a force of string 1 on the washer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='179710'>Now, there's also the gravitational force m washer g.</span>
  </p><p><span m='185650'>And what we also have to consider the fact</span>
  <span m='187460'>is that the person is sitting on the platform.</span>
  </p><p><span m='190750'>So the platform is pushing the person up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='193900'>And we'll call that a normal force on the
  washer</span> <span m='197600'>due to the platform.</span> </p><p><span
  m='199600'>And those are the free body diagram for the body diagram</span>
  <span m='203870'>on the washer.</span> </p><p><span m='204930'>Now let's focus
  on the platform.</span> </p><p><span m='207610'>So here, we'll draw the
  platform.</span> </p><p><span m='212070'>And now let's look at the forces on
  the platform.</span> </p><p><span m='214390'>Let's begin by looking for the
  internal forces, the Newton's</span> <span m='218030'>third law pairs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='220340'>The platform is pushing the person up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='222450'>The person is pushing the platform down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='225200'>So we'll write that force as N on the platform</span>
  <span m='229130'>due to the washer.</span> </p><p><span m='230329'>And
  immediately, let's just circle this third law pair.</span> </p><p><span
  m='235980'>Now, string 2 is pulling the platform up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='240920'>So let's draw that force.</span> </p><p><span m='244000'>We'll call
  that a tension force in the string.</span> </p><p><span m='246630'>It's on the
  platform due to string 2.</span> </p><p><span m='249850'>And finally, we have
  the gravitational force</span> <span m='252930'>on the platform.</span>
  </p><p><span m='254620'>And that's our free body diagram on the
  platform.</span> </p><p><span m='257940'>Now, you may have said, well, why
  should I separate these</span> <span m='260880'>out?</span> </p><p><span
  m='261380'>Why didn't I just use the person and the platform?</span>
  </p><p><span m='264790'>So let's draw that picture.</span> </p><p><span
  m='266680'>So now imagine underneath this is a system consisting</span> <span
  m='270630'>of the person and the platform.</span> </p><p><span m='274440'>And
  I'll just draw that system like that.</span> </p><p><span m='279120'>So what
  we're doing is we're taking</span> <span m='281150'>these two separate free
  body diagrams</span> <span m='283850'>and we're going to combine them
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='285980'>And by Newton's third law, all internal
  forces</span> <span m='288760'>should cancel in pairs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='290550'>So now let's separately think about the forces</span> <span
  m='292920'>and see that that's the case.</span> </p><p><span m='294470'>Well,
  we have the gravitational force</span> <span m='296420'>on the system, which
  is the mass of the platform</span> <span m='299570'>plus the mass of the
  washer times g.</span> </p><p><span m='303480'>We still have the string
  pulling the person up</span> <span m='308180'>because the person is pulling
  the string down.</span> </p><p><span m='310950'>So we still have the force F1
  on the washer.</span> </p><p><span m='318030'>That's string 1 on the
  washer.</span> </p><p><span m='320100'>And we still have the pulley, the
  tension in string 2,</span> <span m='324830'>pulling it up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='326040'>So we still have the force T2 on the platform.</span>
  </p><p><span m='332150'>Now, when you look at this, what we're doing is</span>
  <span m='335480'>we're adding these two free body diagrams together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='340530'>The internal forces now are the normal force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='344190'>They're equal in magnitude, opposite in
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='347810'>So when you add them together, they
  cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='349909'>And we're just left with that, with
  that, with that,</span> <span m='355100'>and with that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='356590'>And so this is now the combined system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='360080'>Now you might ask, why did we not include the pulley?</span>
  </p><p><span m='364180'>Well, let's take a look at that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='366330'>So I'm going to draw the free body diagram just on pulley</span>
  <span m='370680'>A. So let's draw pulley A.</span> </p><p><span m='373740'>Now
  what we have here is the string on both sides</span> <span m='377450'>is
  pulling pulley A up.</span> </p><p><span m='380200'>And that's the tension in
  string 1.</span> </p><p><span m='384180'>So what we have is-- I'm going to
  call that tension in string</span> <span m='389660'>1, tension in string
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='392890'>And just to alert you that keep in mind that
  this force here</span> <span m='398840'>is the force of the string on the
  person</span> <span m='400970'>and this too is also tension in the
  string,</span> <span m='405810'>because this is our assumption of a massless
  string.</span> </p><p><span m='412140'>So notice that everywhere in the
  string, the tension is uniform.</span> </p><p><span m='418220'>So I'm just
  going to simplify that by calling it T1.</span> </p><p><span m='420620'>What
  are the other forces on the pulley?</span> </p><p><span m='422450'>Well, we're
  assuming that these pulleys are massless.</span> </p><p><span m='426210'>And
  so there's no gravitational force on the pulley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='428880'>And the only thing we have is the string pulling--</span> <span
  m='435520'>is the tension in the string.</span> </p><p><span m='437560'>So now
  this is a little bit different.</span> </p><p><span m='441280'>This is a force
  on the pulley too.</span> </p><p><span m='445050'>So at the moment, let's do
  something a little bit</span> <span m='449210'>different.</span> </p><p><span
  m='450490'>Let's consider our system to be the string.</span> </p><p><span
  m='456620'>So it's pulley A. We call that string 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='461550'>That's our system.</span> </p><p><span m='463827'>So I modified
  that a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='465159'>I just didn't consider the
  pulley separately.</span> </p><p><span m='467060'>I considered the pulley and
  the string as the system.</span> </p><p><span m='470210'>Then here the string
  is pulling the platform up.</span> </p><p><span m='475790'>The platform
  therefore is pulling the string down.</span> </p><p><span m='482030'>And once
  again, we have a third law pair.</span> </p><p><span m='487670'>And so if I
  added these two together,</span> <span m='493820'>then what I now have-- and
  this is why this problem is kind</span> <span m='498630'>of complex-- we have
  pulley A, string 2, platform P</span> <span m='509190'>and washer
  person.</span> </p><p><span m='515880'>And if we now add these two systems
  together,</span> <span m='521808'>we have this complicated system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='524720'>But what are the forces in this system?</span>
  </p><p><span m='526950'>Well, the rope is pulling it up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='531550'>The person was-- remember we had this force, W1,</span> <span
  m='538780'>was the force of string 1 on the washer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='541360'>That also was the tension everywhere in the string.</span>
  </p><p><span m='544600'>So we have another T1 up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='548580'>These two forces now cancel in pairs,</span> <span m='551850'>the
  internal forces there.</span> </p><p><span m='554160'>And so down, we just
  have mass platform plus mass</span> <span m='558090'>of a washer times
  g.</span> </p><p><span m='561980'>And so you see in this problem, if we</span>
  <span m='564110'>tried to treat everything separate--</span> <span
  m='567310'>and I could have even had the string</span> <span
  m='568810'>separate-- I have a lot of free body diagram.</span> </p><p><span
  m='572060'>But when I think about what's internal and what's external,</span>
  <span m='575590'>I can take these two pieces, combine them here,</span> <span
  m='579550'>internal forces cancel in pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='581820'>I
  can draw these two separate systems, again, combine them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='586470'>Internal forces cancel in pair.</span> </p><p><span m='588420'>And
  now I have this pulley A.</span> </p><p><span m='592870'>Now I can write down
  Newton's second law.</span> </p><p><span m='596510'>So what I'll do next is
  I'll introduce--</span> <span m='599290'>I still have to consider pulley B.
  I'll use this as my system.</span> </p><p><span m='603510'>And I'll write down
  Newton's second law.</span> </p><p><span m='605380'>And we'll be able to solve
  this problem.</span> </p><p></p>
