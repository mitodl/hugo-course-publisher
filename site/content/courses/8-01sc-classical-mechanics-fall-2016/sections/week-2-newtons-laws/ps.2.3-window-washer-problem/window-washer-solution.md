title: Window Washer Solution
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4010'>So now that we've combined pulley A, string 2,
  platform,</span> <span m='8200'>and washer as our system, we can now address
  our question.</span> </p><p><span m='12420'>If we measure the acceleration of
  the person,</span> <span m='16170'>what is the force that the person pulls the
  rope down</span> <span m='19810'>with?</span> </p><p><span m='20450'>Well, of
  course, that will just be the tension in the string.</span> </p><p><span
  m='23770'>And with this simple system, we can now</span> <span m='26280'>apply
  Newton's second law, F equals ma.</span> </p><p><span m='30760'>But recall, we
  need some directions.</span> </p><p><span m='33880'>So suppose we expect that
  the acceleration of the platform</span> <span m='39610'>and person is
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='41240'>So we'll choose a unit vector j hat in the
  positive direction.</span> </p><p><span m='46490'>And now the problem becomes
  tension one,</span> <span m='50350'>three different tensions, 3T1, and
  gravitational force</span> <span m='56500'>minus mp plus mw times g.</span>
  </p><p><span m='61570'>Now, what is the mass that we have to consider?</span>
  </p><p><span m='65140'>Again, what is the mass of our system?</span>
  </p><p><span m='67310'>Well, the platform and the person,</span> <span
  m='68750'>and we assume the pulley and the string, too, were massless.</span>
  </p><p><span m='73850'>So we have simply mp plus mw a.</span> </p><p><span
  m='78906'>And so we can now solve for the tension in the string, which</span>
  <span m='83720'>is equal to mp plus mw times g plus a divided by 3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='93140'>And recall that this tension, that the string is
  pulling,</span> <span m='99050'>this is what we called the force that the
  person</span> <span m='103180'>[? of ?] the string on the person.</span>
  </p><p><span m='105210'>And by Newton's third law, that's</span> <span
  m='107450'>also, on the washer, that's also the force that the washer</span>
  <span m='113440'>applies to string 1.</span> </p><p><span m='116259'>So this
  was our goal.</span> </p><p><span m='120380'>It's the force that the washer
  applies</span> <span m='124930'>to string 1 by the third law.</span>
  </p><p><span m='128110'>And so by thinking about how to choose a system,
  what</span> <span m='134420'>could be a very complicated problem,</span> <span
  m='136160'>with lots of equations, is simply one equation.</span> </p><p></p>
