transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3280'>The little prince lives on his asteroid B-612.</span>
  </p><p><span m='7080'>And he really likes to watch the stars.</span>
  </p><p><span m='9840'>And what he really wishes for is to watch the
  stars</span> <span m='13450'>while floating, to have the best possible
  view</span> <span m='17430'>and to just immerse himself in the stars.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20769'>And so the little prince has to think</span> <span
  m='22310'>if there is a position in space with respect</span> <span
  m='25130'>to other celestial bodies where the gravitational force would</span>
  <span m='29010'>just cancel, so that he can float.</span> </p><p><span
  m='32420'>Let's look at that.</span> </p><p><span m='34810'>So there is the
  planet of the businessman.</span> </p><p><span m='38470'>We're going to give
  it the mass m1.</span> </p><p><span m='40970'>And there is also the small
  planet from the lamplighter</span> <span m='44310'>floating around with a mass
  m2.</span> </p><p><span m='48690'>And we know that gravitational forces act
  radially.</span> </p><p><span m='54630'>So we can already see here that if we
  put the asteroid B-612</span> <span m='60660'>somewhere here, then maybe we
  find a constellation where</span> <span m='65080'>gravitational forces
  cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='67840'>So let's start by placing the little
  asteroid over here.</span> </p><p><span m='73050'>And what is this body
  experiencing in terms</span> <span m='75610'>of gravitational forces?</span>
  </p><p><span m='78360'>Well, it's going to experience a gravitational force of
  object</span> <span m='82539'>1.</span> </p><p><span m='84010'>So we have
  object 1 or F1m, due to the interaction</span> <span m='91090'>between object
  1-- so the businessman planet</span> <span m='95009'>and our little asteroid
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='97460'>And then we also, of course, have the same
  direction</span> <span m='102509'>here due to the interaction of object</span>
  <span m='105310'>2 and our little asteroid, so that would be F2m.</span>
  </p><p><span m='111630'>And you can clearly see that if we tally up these
  forces,</span> <span m='115820'>they're not going to add to 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='118030'>So this is not a good location for the little
  prince's</span> <span m='121280'>asteroid to be.</span> </p><p><span
  m='123380'>The same would be true if we put it out here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='127200'>It will experience those same forces again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='132260'>What do we have here-- 1m and 2m just going</span> <span
  m='137579'>in the opposite direction.</span> </p><p><span m='138800'>But you
  have guessed it already.</span> </p><p><span m='141360'>We can find a spot
  here in the middle where one force goes</span> <span m='148560'>in this
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='149740'>So this is F2m.</span> </p><p><span
  m='153140'>And actually we should give those forces direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='159950'>And the other body exerts a force</span> <span
  m='164850'>going in the other direction.</span> </p><p><span m='169020'>And so
  we can see that we now just need</span> <span m='172390'>to find that exact
  position here, in between these two</span> <span m='175140'>objects with two
  different masses, where</span> <span m='179510'>the little prince can free
  float while watching the stars.</span> </p><p><span m='183870'>We can say
  already that if these two masses were the same,</span> <span m='187270'>it
  would obviously be in the middle.</span> </p><p><span m='189380'>But because
  they are not the same,</span> <span m='191320'>we have to calculate what that
  distance is.</span> </p><p><span m='194340'>And so we're going to label this
  distance here x.</span> </p><p><span m='198490'>And we're going to say that
  the two bodies here</span> <span m='203020'>are a distance d apart.</span>
  </p><p><span m='206700'>All right.</span> </p><p><span m='207200'>How are we
  going to go about this?</span> </p><p><span m='210040'>Well, we have to apply
  the universal law of gravitation</span> <span m='213590'>in our F equals ma
  analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='219610'>Well, before we started with our F
  equals ma analysis,</span> <span m='222400'>we actually have to pick a
  coordinate origin and a unit</span> <span m='226200'>vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='227110'>And so let's place the coordinate origin in
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='232230'>And let's have i hat go in this
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='236680'>And we're going to label this
  position A, and position B,</span> <span m='244160'>and position C. These are
  our three</span> <span m='247530'>options for asteroid placement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='250780'>And well, let's look at position B.</span>
  </p><p><span m='255880'>And well, we have the universal law</span> <span
  m='259790'>of gravitation between the mass of the object here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='267840'>And we'll have to describe both components.</span>
  </p><p><span m='270420'>So first this one F1m and then F2m.</span>
  </p><p><span m='274510'>And if we start with F1m, that goes in the negative i
  hat</span> <span m='279430'>direction.</span> </p><p><span m='280420'>So minus
  Gmm1 on the distances x squared in the i hat direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='290120'>And then the other one goes in the plus i hat direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='293820'>And we have Gmm2.</span> </p><p><span m='297590'>And
  now we have d minus x gives us</span> <span m='301910'>this portion-- d minus
  x squared also in the i hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='310950'>And that
  needs to add up to 0, because that is what we want,</span> <span
  m='321460'>right?</span> </p><p><span m='324140'>If it adds up to 0, then we
  have no gravitational forces</span> <span m='327330'>acting on the
  asteroid.</span> </p><p><span m='331290'>So now we need to solve this for x
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='334900'>And in the first step, you see that
  actually G and m</span> <span m='338800'>will fall out here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='340790'>And then we're left with m1 over x</span> <span
  m='344030'>squared minus plus m2 over d minus x squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='353740'>And we can write that as m2 x squared</span> <span m='360010'>minus
  m2 d minus x squared.</span> </p><p><span m='367090'>And what you see here is
  that this will</span> <span m='370190'>turn into a quadratic equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='373330'>And if we do a few steps of arithmetic,</span> <span
  m='376380'>and then write down the general solution</span> <span m='380970'>to
  this quadratic equation, we will find this here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='386350'>x equals 2dm1 plus minus 2dm1 squared minus 4m1 minus m2m1d</span>
  <span m='410420'>squared, and then the square root of that over m1 minus
  m2.</span> </p><p><span m='420330'>And actually we need two of those.</span>
  </p><p><span m='423870'>So we have this quadratic equation here-- well,</span>
  <span m='427570'>the solution.</span> </p><p><span m='428970'>And we now need
  to consider one more thing-- namely,</span> <span m='433170'>this equation
  here is only valid if-- well,</span> <span m='438820'>can I write this here--
  if x is between 0 and d.</span> </p><p><span m='445860'>Right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='447180'>In position C, my x is larger than d,</span> <span
  m='452350'>which means this-- sorry, this force here flips sign,</span> <span
  m='458540'>and then this would be different.</span> </p><p><span m='460870'>So
  this plus here refers to x being less than d.</span> </p><p><span
  m='467420'>And we have to decide which of the two signs</span> <span
  m='470909'>here gives us the correct, which will</span> <span
  m='477440'>fulfills this requirement here.</span> </p><p><span m='480130'>So
  this simplifies to x equals dm1 plus minus m1m2</span> <span m='492660'>and
  here we have the square root.</span> </p><p><span m='495270'>And then here, we
  have another bracket over m1 minus m2.</span> </p><p><span m='503580'>And we
  need to get this term here smaller</span> <span m='507510'>than 1, which will
  be smaller than 1 if the x is</span> <span m='512940'>between 0 and d.</span>
  </p><p><span m='515169'>And as it turns out, that is indeed true</span> <span
  m='518308'>if we use the minus sign here.</span> </p>
