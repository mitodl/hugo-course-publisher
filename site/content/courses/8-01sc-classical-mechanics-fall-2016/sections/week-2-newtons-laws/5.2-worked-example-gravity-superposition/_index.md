![A diagram showing the distance between the two planets.](https://open-learning-course-data-ci.s3.amazonaws.com/8-01sc-classical-mechanics-fall-2016/278168bfd79f3a36029c19e927a6d33a_ls02_12.svg)

The center of two spherical planets of masses \\(\\displaystyle m\_1 \\) and \\(\\displaystyle m\_2 \\) are separated by a distance \\(\\displaystyle d \\). Consider the origin of the coordinate system to be at the center of planet 1. At what location \\(\\displaystyle x \\) measured from the center of planet 1 will a third planet of mass \\(\\displaystyle m \\) experience zero gravitational force? Assume \\(\\displaystyle m\_1 \\ne m\_2 \\).

Express your answer in terms of the gravitational constant \\(\\displaystyle G \\), \\(\\displaystyle m\_1 \\), \\(\\displaystyle m\_2 \\) and \\(\\displaystyle d \\) as needed.
