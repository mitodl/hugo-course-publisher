title: 7.3 Solving Pulley Systems
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3290'>One of our classic problems to analyze</span> <span
  m='6230'>using Newton's second law is the motion</span> <span m='8320'>of two
  blocks with a rope that's wrapped around a pulley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='11670'>So imagine we have a pulley, P, and we hang from that block 1</span>
  <span m='16990'>and we hang from that block 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='19360'>The pulley is suspended by another rope,</span> <span m='22480'>and
  it's attached to a wall.</span> </p><p><span m='25180'>And let's now try to
  use Newton's second law</span> <span m='28150'>to analyze this motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='30040'>Now, going back to our methodology, the first
  thing</span> <span m='33450'>we want to ask ourselves is to identify</span>
  <span m='36320'>what are all the moving pieces?</span> </p><p><span
  m='39190'>So I'm going to make my first assumption here,</span> <span
  m='44290'>that the rope/pulley a surface so that's right</span> <span
  m='51020'>here is frictionless.</span> </p><p><span m='55070'>Now, what that
  assumption means is that the pulley</span> <span m='59170'>will remain at
  rest.</span> </p><p><span m='63840'>And therefore, when we want to break this
  problem down,</span> <span m='67130'>our first question is to identify all the
  moving</span> <span m='73939'>objects.</span> </p><p><span m='77580'>And so we
  really have three.</span> </p><p><span m='80150'>We have mass, which we label
  by 1, 2, and the rope.</span> </p><p><span m='86490'>So our goal now is to
  identify all the moving objects</span> <span m='90380'>and to draw free body
  force diagrams for each moving</span> <span m='102990'>object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='107289'>Now, one of the things that I'm especially</span>
  <span m='109039'>interested in talking about is to keep in mind to
  identify</span> <span m='114890'>action-reaction pairs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='117289'>So as I go through and draw these free body diagrams,</span> <span
  m='121120'>we want to ask ourselves, what forces</span> <span m='123950'>form
  Newton's third law action-reaction pairs?</span> </p><p><span m='127090'>So
  what I'll do is I'll start with object 1.</span> </p><p><span m='131590'>Now,
  I'm object 1 has a gravitational force M 1 g.</span> </p><p><span
  m='136100'>And the rope is pulling object 1 up</span> <span m='139980'>with
  the tension at the end of the rope T rope 1.</span> </p><p><span m='144560'>So
  the action- reaction pair to M 1 g</span> <span m='148160'>is the Earth, is
  the force of this mass on the Earth,</span> <span m='150990'>which we're not
  considering.</span> </p><p><span m='152430'>What about the rope?</span>
  </p><p><span m='154350'>So now, let's draw a picture of our rope.</span>
  </p><p><span m='159550'>And mass, this object here is pulling the rope
  down,</span> <span m='165250'>and so we have, on the rope, object 1 pulling it
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='170190'>And this is our action-reaction
  pair.</span> </p><p><span m='176520'>What are the other forces on the
  rope?</span> </p><p><span m='178670'>Well over here, object 2, t 2, is pulling
  the rope down</span> <span m='188040'>with the tension at the end of that
  rope.</span> </p><p><span m='191640'>Now, also, the pulley is exerting a
  force</span> <span m='195460'>on the rope upwards, because we have that
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='199710'>And so these are the force diagrams on
  the rope.</span> </p><p><span m='203300'>Now, what about the action-reaction
  pair</span> <span m='206090'>to T 2 rope?</span> </p><p><span m='207770'>Well,
  let's continue and draw 2.</span> </p><p><span m='211100'>We have, again,
  gravitational force on 2,</span> <span m='213720'>the Earth is the
  action-reaction pair.</span> </p><p><span m='215730'>The force of 2 on the
  Earth upwards</span> <span m='219360'>is equal to m 2g of the Earth
  downwards.</span> </p><p><span m='222117'>We're not drawing the Earth in this
  picture,</span> <span m='223950'>so we don't show it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='224783'>Now, here is the force of the rope on 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='230150'>And there is our other action-reaction pair.</span> </p><p><span
  m='234670'>So these are Newton's third law pairs in this object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='238290'>Now, now that we've identified all the forces,</span>
  <span m='241580'>we want to apply Newton's second law</span> <span
  m='245290'>to each of these objects that are moving.</span> </p><p><span
  m='251020'>So let's begin by remembering that if our rope--</span> <span
  m='256265'>our next assumption here, it's assumed</span> <span m='260390'>that
  the mass of the rope is very light.</span> </p><p><span m='263610'>And then
  the tension in the rope is constant.</span> </p><p><span m='266980'>And the
  implication of that is T 2 r equals t 1 r.</span> </p><p><span m='272290'>And
  that's why we can now identify this as T</span> <span m='278200'>and that as
  T.</span> </p><p><span m='281760'>Little bit later on, when we talk about
  pulleys</span> <span m='284320'>that have mass with friction between
  them,</span> <span m='287450'>the tension on the two sides of the
  pulley</span> <span m='289950'>will not be the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='291570'>But for the moment, we've made these assumptions,</span> <span
  m='293830'>and that holds.</span> </p><p><span m='295120'>And now, we just
  really have objects 1 and object 2 analyze.</span> </p><p><span m='299900'>And
  so one of the things that helps a lot</span> <span m='303490'>is, we need to
  choose unit vectors in order</span> <span m='307010'>to write down the vector
  equations for Newton's</span> <span m='309170'>second law.</span> </p><p><span
  m='310140'>So let's just here assume for ourselves</span> <span
  m='313420'>that M 1 is greater than M 2.</span> </p><p><span m='316170'>This
  gives us some feeling for how the system moves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='318490'>I like to do this because it gives me</span> <span m='320110'>a way
  to choose my unit vectors to make</span> <span m='322390'>all the
  accelerations positive.</span> </p><p><span m='324910'>So when M 1 is bigger
  than M 2, I expect M 1 to go down</span> <span m='329570'>and 2 go up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='331170'>And that's how I'm going to choose unit vectors j hat
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='335780'>Now, here is the very interesting
  thing.</span> </p><p><span m='338820'>We choose a separate coordinate system
  for each object.</span> </p><p><span m='342870'>So I'm going to write that
  down.</span> </p><p><span m='344680'>We want to choose separate unit vectors
  for each object.</span> </p><p><span m='357140'>And our accelerations will be
  with respect</span> <span m='359550'>to those unit vectors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='361620'>This is where a lot of people get tripped up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='364060'>So here, I'm choosing j hat 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='367800'>And when I choose that, I expect a 2</span> <span m='372680'>to be
  positive because 2 is going up</span> <span m='375350'>in the direction of j
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='376730'>And here, I expect a 1 to be positive
  also,</span> <span m='383680'>because 1 is going down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='386290'>Now I can draw Newton's second law on 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='391250'>So I have F 1 equals M 1 a 1.</span> </p><p><span m='397500'>And
  now I analyze my forces, M 1 g is in the positive j hat</span> <span
  m='401970'>direction, t is in the negative j hat direction,</span> <span
  m='405040'>so I have M 1 g minus t equals M 1 a 1,</span> <span
  m='410440'>which I'm expecting to be positive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='412770'>And in the same way, on 2, F 2 equals M 2 a 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='421260'>I look at my force diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='422510'>Now,
  notice, j hat is up, so t is positive</span> <span m='427210'>and 2 g is minus
  my direction, and 2 g equals M 2 a 2.</span> </p><p><span m='435170'>So I now
  have two equations, but when I look at these equations,</span> <span
  m='439620'>I see that I have three unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='441880'>I
  have t, a 1, and a 2.</span> </p><p><span m='445420'>But I have a constraint,
  because these objects are moving</span> <span m='449090'>together and the way
  I've chosen the coordinate systems,</span> <span m='453070'>a 1 is equal to
  plus a 2, both are positive with respect</span> <span m='460440'>to my choice
  of coordinate systems.</span> </p><p><span m='462720'>And so these two as are
  the same.</span> </p><p><span m='465909'>And now I can solve my equations for
  t and a.</span> </p><p><span m='470165'>And let's quickly do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='471960'>M 1 g minus t equals M 1 a.</span> </p><p><span
  m='476006'>And over here, let's solve for the tension,</span> <span
  m='479790'>for the accelerations here.</span> </p><p><span m='481530'>T is
  equal to m 2 a plus m 2 g.</span> </p><p><span m='486860'>And when I
  substitute the t into that equation,</span> <span m='490330'>we'll find some
  space for that.</span> </p><p><span m='492770'>we'll write that as, if I put
  in the M 2 minus M 2 a minus M 2 g</span> <span m='500470'>and bring the M 2 a
  to the other side,</span> <span m='504220'>then it's a little bit of
  algebra,</span> <span m='506350'>but I think you'll trust me that this is M 1
  minus M 2</span> <span m='512361'>g over M 1 plus M 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='520200'>Now, we're almost done.</span> </p><p><span m='522640'>We need to
  check our answers.</span> </p><p><span m='524340'>First off, does it have the
  dimensions of acceleration?</span> </p><p><span m='527330'>Answer, yes, mass
  divided by mass,</span> <span m='529990'>g has the dimensions of
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='532170'>So that's my first check always
  with my algebra.</span> </p><p><span m='535270'>Second check, what if M 1 is
  equal to M 2?</span> </p><p><span m='539430'>Then the acceleration is 0, I
  expect them to be balanced.</span> </p><p><span m='543830'>I've said that M 1
  is greater than M 2.</span> </p><p><span m='546530'>Positive sign, my A is
  positive.</span> </p><p><span m='549200'>That's how I set up my coordinate
  system,</span> <span m='551120'>so I expect that too.</span> </p><p><span
  m='552500'>By the way, our symbol a was equal to those.</span> </p><p><span
  m='556630'>And so I'm pretty confident that my result is correct.</span>
  </p><p><span m='561380'>And that's how we apply Newton's second law</span>
  <span m='563740'>to the pulley with several assumptions,</span> <span
  m='567450'>frictionless surface, massless rope.</span> </p><p><span
  m='571210'>And think about how we chose our unit vectors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='576290'>Each object gets its separate coordinate system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='580030'>I'm not using the same coordinate system</span> <span
  m='582030'>for each object.</span> </p><p><span m='583842'>I could've, but
  then there would be</span> <span m='585300'>a subtlety to this condition, the
  accelerations</span> <span m='588150'>would be opposite in sign.</span>
