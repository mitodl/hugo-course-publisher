  <p><span m='3990'>Newton's first law tells us about the motion</span> <span
  m='6380'>of isolated bodies.</span> </p><p><span m='7940'>By an "isolated
  body," we mean one on which the net force</span> <span m='11060'>is 0, one
  that's isolated from all interactions</span> <span m='13345'>to as great a
  degree as possible.</span> </p><p><span m='16190'>Newton's first law states
  that an isolated body</span> <span m='19110'>moves in a straight line at
  constant velocity</span> <span m='21720'>and will continue to do so as long as
  it remains undisturbed.</span> </p><p><span m='24860'>Note that that constant
  velocity might be 0.</span> </p><p><span m='27920'>So for example, a body at
  rest-- an isolated body at rest</span> <span m='30880'>will remain at rest if
  left undisturbed.</span> </p><p><span m='33740'>An isolated body moving at
  constant velocity</span> <span m='36470'>will continue to move at a constant
  velocity</span> <span m='38330'>as long as it remains undisturbed.</span>
  </p><p><span m='41370'>It turns out that it's always possible to define</span>
  <span m='43590'>a coordinate system in which an isolated body moves</span>
  <span m='46170'>at constant velocity, perhaps 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='48490'>Such a coordinate system is called an "inertial coordinate</span>
  <span m='51010'>system."</span> <span m='52800'>So another way of stating
  Newton's first law</span> <span m='54820'>is that inertial coordinate systems
  exist.</span> </p><p><span m='58250'>Now, it's worth pointing out that
  not</span> <span m='60300'>all useful coordinate systems are inertial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='63620'>The ones that aren't we call "non-inertial
  coordinate</span> <span m='65840'>systems."</span> <span m='66520'>As an
  example, imagine that I am standing in an elevator that's</span> <span
  m='70920'>accelerating upward.</span> </p><p><span m='72860'>If we defined a
  coordinate system that</span> <span m='75090'>moves with the elevator, that
  coordinate system</span> <span m='77980'>is accelerated with respect to an
  observer who is at rest.</span> </p><p><span m='82460'>In that accelerated
  coordinate system,</span> <span m='84260'>an isolated body would not move at a
  constant velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='88210'>So there are applications
  where using</span> <span m='90400'>non-inertial coordinate systems is
  convenient.</span> </p><p><span m='92830'>However, in this course, we will
  concentrate</span> <span m='94880'>on inertial coordinate systems in which
  isolated bodies move</span> <span m='99472'>at a constant velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='104140'>What if the body is not isolated?</span> </p><p><span
  m='106820'>If a force acts on a body, then it</span> <span m='108780'>will
  accelerate in proportion to that force.</span> </p><p><span m='111810'>In
  particular, for a point like constant mass,</span> <span m='116530'>Newton's
  second law tells us that the vector force</span> <span m='120600'>is equal to
  the mass times the vector acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='125370'>So in
  other words, the acceleration caused by a force</span> <span m='129024'>is
  proportional to that force and the constant</span> <span m='130940'>of
  proportionality is the mass.</span> </p><p><span m='133430'>And there are two
  important points</span> <span m='134980'>I want to make about Newton's second
  law.</span> </p><p><span m='137620'>The first is that forces always
  involved</span> <span m='140690'>real physical interactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='142440'>Something must be acting on the object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='145130'>If nothing is acting on the object,</span> <span
  m='146620'>if the object is isolated, then we</span> <span m='148050'>know--
  from Newton's first law-- that an isolated body never</span> <span
  m='150960'>accelerates in an inertial frame.</span> </p><p><span m='152660'>It
  moves at constant velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='154310'>So the only way to
  have an object</span> <span m='157500'>move with a velocity that's
  changing--</span> <span m='159230'>that is, to have an acceleration--</span>
  <span m='160680'>is to have a force acting on it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='162250'>And Newton's second law tells us exactly how that works.</span>
  </p><p><span m='165970'>The second point I want to make is</span> <span
  m='167850'>that this statement of Newton's second law, F equals ma,</span>
  <span m='171620'>is actually a special case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='173530'>It's for the special case of a constant point like mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='178150'>More generally, Newton's second law is written as the
  force</span> <span m='183560'>is equal to the time derivative of the momentum,
  p.</span> </p><p><span m='189550'>Now, we'll talk about momentum later in this
  course in more</span> <span m='192460'>detail, but I'll just tell you that the
  momentum,</span> <span m='196200'>for a point like mass, is defined</span>
  <span m='198150'>as the mass times the velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='205310'>Now, for a point mass that's constant,</span> <span
  m='208700'>these two equations are exactly identical.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211260'>If you take the derivative of m times v where m is a
  constant,</span> <span m='215890'>you just get m times the vector a.</span>
  </p><p><span m='217900'>And you get the first equation back.</span>
  </p><p><span m='220560'>So it's just a fancier way of writing the same
  thing.</span> </p><p><span m='223160'>It doesn't convey any new
  information.</span> </p><p><span m='225110'>So why do we talk about this as
  being the more general form?</span> </p><p><span m='228610'>It's because this
  second form of Newton's second law</span> <span m='231760'>can be generalized
  to a system of particles or a system</span> <span m='235070'>where mass is
  flowing and the mass of something is changing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='238710'>You can't describe that by F equals ma,</span> <span m='240710'>but
  it's always true that, for a given system, F equals dp/dt.</span> </p><p><span
  m='245624'>And we'll see how that works in more complicated mass flow</span>
  <span m='248040'>problems later in the course.</span> </p><p></p>
