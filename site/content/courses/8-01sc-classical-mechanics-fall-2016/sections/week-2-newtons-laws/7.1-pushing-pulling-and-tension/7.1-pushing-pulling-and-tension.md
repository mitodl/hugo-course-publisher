  <p><span m='4190'>Here we have a little block that sits on that
  surface.</span> </p><p><span m='7700'>And well, what can one do with a
  block?</span> </p><p><span m='10370'>You can push it, or you can pull
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='14430'>And that's exactly what we're going to look
  at now.</span> </p><p><span m='16730'>So I can exert a pushing force onto this
  block here, F push.</span> </p><p><span m='25670'>But I could also pull it
  like this, F pull.</span> </p><p><span m='31310'>And the question is, how can
  we formalize this a little bit</span> <span m='35480'>more?</span>
  </p><p><span m='36060'>We can now also look at a small piece of rope or a
  string.</span> </p><p><span m='42070'>And I could, in the tug of war, I'm
  going to pull here.</span> </p><p><span m='47270'>And I'm also going to pull
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='49610'>And we'll see who is going to win.</span>
  </p><p><span m='52690'>So we have two opposing forces here on either
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='58800'>In a slightly different scenario,</span>
  <span m='61920'>where we're going to put both of these things together,</span>
  <span m='64620'>we have a block here sitting on a surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m='68250'>And we have a little string attached to it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='70860'>And let's say we have a pulley here,</span> <span m='74510'>and the
  string goes around there and has</span> <span m='76770'>a little mass hanging
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='79480'>We want to now describe what this force is
  here</span> <span m='83140'>that's pulling things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='84670'>And for that, we have to look at what's</span> <span m='86530'>going
  on in that little string.</span> </p><p><span m='89700'>So let's draw another
  string.</span> </p><p><span m='94530'>And this is our string.</span>
  </p><p><span m='96930'>And let's take an imaginary cut right through the
  middle here.</span> </p><p><span m='101030'>And I'm going to draw both pieces
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='103680'>This is the left part, and here is the
  right part.</span> </p><p><span m='108580'>And what's happening in this rope
  here now?</span> </p><p><span m='113990'>Well, there is a force acting on the
  left object</span> <span m='120150'>due to the interaction with the right
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='123470'>And here we have a force on the right
  one,</span> <span m='127700'>due to the interaction of the left piece.</span>
  </p><p><span m='130400'>And that, of course, happens anywhere.</span>
  </p><p><span m='133170'>I take a cut here along the line.</span> </p><p><span
  m='136590'>And we can even formalize that a little bit more</span> <span
  m='139650'>by just placing our coordinate system here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143220'>And let's say x equals 0 here.</span> </p><p><span m='144880'>And
  so for all x along this line,</span> <span m='148440'>we always have these
  pairs of forces.</span> </p><p><span m='150650'>So they are an interaction
  pair.</span> </p><p><span m='153180'>And if I look at the rope from afar, they
  will cancel out.</span> </p><p><span m='157960'>But if I look at what's going
  on inside the rope,</span> <span m='161100'>then this is what they are.</span>
  </p><p><span m='162750'>And we know from Newton's third law</span> <span
  m='166134'>that F RL equals minus F LR.</span> </p><p><span m='175370'>So
  they're forces of the same magnitude,</span> <span m='180540'>but the opposite
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='182770'>If they weren't the same, then my
  rope would get in trouble.</span> </p><p><span m='188842'>But what we want to
  define now actually</span> <span m='191560'>is tension, the tension force,
  that</span> <span m='194760'>is along, that's happening along,</span> <span
  m='198060'>this rope here in our tug of war if someone</span> <span
  m='201480'>pulls from the outside.</span> </p><p><span m='203250'>And for
  that, we first got to look</span> <span m='206480'>at the magnitude of our
  interaction pair here, F RL.</span> </p><p><span m='212870'>And that, of
  course, equals the magnitude of F LR.</span> </p><p><span m='219180'>And we're
  actually going to define now this magnitude here</span> <span m='223510'>as
  the tension force.</span> </p><p><span m='225930'>And that is true for all x
  along this line</span> <span m='230120'>here, that we have this, the
  magnitude,</span> <span m='236260'>that this is the magnitude of this force
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='239860'>And from now on, we're going to
  call--</span> <span m='243440'>when we talk about tension in the rope,</span>
  <span m='246500'>then we talk about the magnitude of one of these internal
  forces</span> <span m='251210'>here.</span> </p><p></p>
