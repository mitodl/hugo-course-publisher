title: 4.4 Non-inertial Reference Frames
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4200'>Now that we've seen how coordinates are related</span> <span
  m='6300'>between two inertial frames, I want</span> <span m='10150'>to
  consider a slightly more advanced example</span> <span m='12290'>for a moment,
  which is supposed that capital V, the vector</span> <span m='17390'>velocity
  of frame S prime relative to inertial frame S,</span> <span m='20840'>is not a
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='23250'>So in this case, suppose that frame S
  prime has</span> <span m='25810'>an acceleration, capital A, relative to
  S.</span> </p><p><span m='29950'>We now say that as prime is a non-inertial
  frame, because it</span> <span m='33720'>is accelerated relative to frame S.
  Now</span> <span m='36630'>we saw that in inertial frames, one always</span>
  <span m='39490'>measures the same acceleration for the same object,</span>
  <span m='42250'>even though you'll measure different velocities</span> <span
  m='44710'>in different positions in general.</span> </p><p><span
  m='46570'>That's not going to true in a non-inertial frame.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49020'>In a non-inertial frame, the acceleration, A
  prime,</span> <span m='55360'>is equal to the acceleration of frame S minus
  capital</span> <span m='60550'>A, the acceleration of frame S prime relative
  to S. Remember,</span> <span m='64330'>capital A is 0 for S prime being an
  inertial frame,</span> <span m='68370'>when capital V is a constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='70110'>But if capital V is not a constant,</span> <span
  m='71940'>then capital A is not 0.</span> </p><p><span m='74120'>So you will
  measure different accelerations</span> <span m='77060'>in these different
  frames.</span> </p><p><span m='79250'>Now what that tells us is that Newton's
  laws are going</span> <span m='81760'>to look a little different.</span>
  </p><p><span m='83810'>And let's see how that works.</span> </p><p><span
  m='85539'>So now, the force measured in frame S prime-- I'll</span> <span
  m='90440'>call that F prime-- we expect that from Newton's second law</span>
  <span m='94360'>to be the mass times the acceleration A prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='101120'>But that is the mass times the acceleration
  measured</span> <span m='105350'>in frame S minus m capital A, the
  acceleration of frame S</span> <span m='113300'>prime relative to frame
  S.</span> </p><p><span m='115400'>Now I can rewrite this as two terms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120260'>One I'll call F physical, which represents the
  physical forces</span> <span m='126920'>acting on the object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='131038'>And the second term, I'm going to call</span> <span
  m='134520'>F fictitious for reasons that we'll see in a moment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='139880'>So what this means is the following</span> <span
  m='142460'>is that an observer in frame S prime in order</span> <span
  m='147280'>to explain the motion of the object using Newton's laws</span>
  <span m='151180'>will have to invoke not just the physical forces
  interacting</span> <span m='155240'>on the object, which might be due to
  gravity</span> <span m='157230'>or rope pulling or an engine pushing</span>
  <span m='159960'>or a hand acting on something, but will also</span> <span
  m='163380'>have to both an apparent force, which I'll call F
  fictitious,</span> <span m='168470'>that acts on everything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='169700'>And in this case, F fictitious is equal to minus m
  capital A.</span> </p><p><span m='180180'>But that force will not be
  associated, will not</span> <span m='182990'>be identifiable with any actual,
  real physical interaction.</span> </p><p><span m='187250'>It's an artifact of
  the choice of coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='189880'>It's an
  artifact of the non-inertial coordinate system</span> <span m='192840'>that
  frame S prime is in.</span> </p><p><span m='195280'>For that reason, we call
  it a fictitious force.</span> </p><p><span m='198030'>And it's to be
  distinguished from real, physical forces</span> <span m='201090'>of the type
  that we've been talking about up until now.</span> </p><p><span m='204350'>So
  you may have seen earlier that</span> <span m='207290'>for the motion of an
  object in a circle around some center point</span> <span m='213820'>implies
  the presence of an inward acceleration</span> <span m='216650'>toward the
  center of the circle.</span> </p><p><span m='218750'>So as a consequence of
  that, a rotating reference frame,</span> <span m='221810'>for example, a
  reference frame that</span> <span m='223430'>rotates with the Earth's
  rotation,</span> <span m='225510'>is accelerated relative to an inertial
  frame.</span> </p><p><span m='229050'>This results in a fictitious
  force</span> <span m='231170'>that has two terms, a centrifugal term and a
  Coriolis</span> <span m='234600'>term.</span> </p><p><span m='235100'>You may
  have come across this Coriolis force</span> <span m='237640'>and centrifugal
  force before.</span> </p><p><span m='239200'>These are examples of fictitious
  forces</span> <span m='241600'>because they arise from the choice of
  coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='245120'>They're an artificial
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='247100'>They don't correspond to actual,
  physical interactions,</span> <span m='250680'>but are an artifact of the
  rotating, non-inertial</span> <span m='253410'>coordinate system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='255140'>Now, in this course we will confine ourselves</span>
  <span m='257810'>to inertial reference frames.</span> </p><p><span
  m='259180'>And therefore, we'll only be considering</span> <span
  m='260920'>real, physical forces and interactions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='264200'>However, there are advanced applications</span> <span
  m='266810'>where the use of a non-inertial frame has certain
  advantages.</span> </p><p><span m='269980'>And you may encounter those as
  you</span> <span m='271790'>go to more advanced courses.</span> </p><p></p>
