  <p><span m='3440'>We now would like to analyze the force</span> <span
  m='5340'>law on an idealized spring, a force law called Hooke's law.</span>
  </p><p><span m='10850'>Let's begin by drawing a ideal spring connected</span>
  <span m='15630'>to an object on a frictionless surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m='18150'>So we'll draw our object.</span> </p><p><span m='21450'>We'll draw
  our idealized spring.</span> </p><p><span m='25300'>This surface here is going
  to be frictionless.</span> </p><p><span m='32400'>And this is a wall, and
  we'll draw it like that.</span> </p><p><span m='36090'>And now what we'd like
  to do is to introduce the force law</span> <span m='40670'>for a spring, a
  force law, which will be called Hooke's law.</span> </p><p><span m='45150'>So
  the way we'd like to analyze this</span> <span m='47710'>is by drawing two
  pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='50100'>Our first picture will have the
  spring</span> <span m='52930'>at an equilibrium picture.</span> </p><p><span
  m='54970'>So let's draw the wall again and let's</span> <span m='59470'>draw
  the spring and our object.</span> </p><p><span m='63360'>And this is called
  the equilibrium picture,</span> <span m='67300'>so I'll write equilibrium
  picture.</span> </p><p><span m='72039'>And now what we like to do is
  draw</span> <span m='74640'>a picture, a dynamic picture at some arbitrary
  time t</span> <span m='78670'>so here we have a dynamic picture at time
  t.</span> </p><p><span m='84760'>And I'll draw it in a second.</span>
  </p><p><span m='87740'>So we draw the same object, and now we're</span> <span
  m='92090'>going to move our object to some arbitrary position.</span>
  </p><p><span m='96630'>In this case, the spring has been stretched,</span>
  <span m='99479'>wall, frictionless surface.</span> </p><p><span m='101950'>And
  now, I'm in position to choose a coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='105020'>So what I'll do is I'll choose my origin at the edge right</span>
  <span m='110690'>here, this is called x equal 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='114070'>I'll show it in the dynamic picture.</span> </p><p><span
  m='116430'>And my coordinate function for the object</span> <span
  m='119160'>here, I'm going to refer to that as x sub t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='124820'>Now, notice that this coordinate function is also</span> <span
  m='127380'>an indication of how much the spring has been displaced.</span>
  </p><p><span m='131420'>As far as directions go, we'll have an axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='135160'>And this is our plus x direction,</span> <span
  m='137340'>so usually we indicate that with the unit vector i hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='142450'>And now Hooke's law is the statement</span> <span
  m='146060'>that the force on the spring, that the force on the object F</span>
  <span m='153240'>is proportional to how much the object has displaced,</span>
  <span m='157920'>which represents either the stretching</span> <span
  m='160040'>or the compressing of the spring.</span> </p><p><span m='162770'>So
  it's equal to minus kx I hat.</span> </p><p><span m='168950'>Now, what does
  this minus sign mean?</span> </p><p><span m='171410'>Well, this is an example
  of what we call a restoring force.</span> </p><p><span m='176829'>And let's
  look at just a couple of examples.</span> </p><p><span m='179410'>When x is
  positive, that means that the object</span> <span m='183440'>has been pulled
  out from the equilibrium position.</span> </p><p><span m='186010'>The spring
  is undergoing tension,</span> <span m='188780'>it's being stretched
  apart.</span> </p><p><span m='189960'>The molecules in the spring that
  constitute the spring</span> <span m='193430'>are being pulled apart, and
  there's a restoring force</span> <span m='196810'>inside the spring.</span>
  </p><p><span m='198270'>This is an atomic force in nature</span> <span
  m='200140'>that's pulling the spring backwards,</span> <span m='202650'>hence
  exerting a restoring force on the object.</span> </p><p><span m='206450'>So
  this forces in the minus i hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='210510'>It's
  restoring in that direction.</span> </p><p><span m='212720'>I'll draw the
  force like that.</span> </p><p><span m='216610'>Now, suppose we drew another
  picture</span> <span m='219790'>where the object is pushed in, compressing the
  spring.</span> </p><p><span m='225270'>So let's draw once again a
  diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='229800'>And let's show the spring under
  compression</span> <span m='234360'>from our equilibrium position.</span>
  </p><p><span m='237560'>Now here, we have, again, that x of t.</span>
  </p><p><span m='243620'>But in this case, x of t is negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='248830'>So this is extension, so we'll call that case
  A.</span> </p><p><span m='256106'>And case B, when x is less than 0, it's
  under compression.</span> </p><p><span m='265470'>And then we see that with x
  negative</span> <span m='269040'>and the additional minus sign, the
  force</span> <span m='271423'>is in the positive direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='274530'>And so in both instances, the force</span> <span
  m='277570'>is a restoring force back to equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span
  m='280230'>So the restoring force, whether you're</span> <span
  m='282480'>under extension or compression, is pointing,</span> <span
  m='288210'>let's just call it, is the direction</span> <span m='291540'>of the
  force is towards the equilibrium position.</span> </p><p><span m='302470'>And
  this example of a restoring force</span> <span m='308050'>is also only
  proportional to x.</span> </p><p><span m='311950'>And so in that case, we can
  add the word linear,</span> <span m='315470'>because it's just to the single
  power x.</span> </p><p><span m='318280'>And this is an example of a linear
  restoring force.</span> </p><p><span m='322350'>And this is a model for an
  ideal spring.</span> </p><p><span m='331620'>Now, this constant k is called
  the spring constant.</span> </p><p><span m='338810'>And the units of the
  spring constant,</span> <span m='341159'>if you divide the units of force by
  the units of distance--</span> <span m='344850'>so we have SI units are Newton
  over meters,</span> <span m='353180'>and that's the measure of the spring
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='355600'>Now, what we'll show next is an
  experiment in which we</span> <span m='359340'>can figure out how to actually
  measure that spring constant k.</span> </p><p></p>
