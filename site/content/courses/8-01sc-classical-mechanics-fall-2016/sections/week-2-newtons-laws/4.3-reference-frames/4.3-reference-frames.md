  <p><span m='3560'>We can consider a given coordinate system</span> <span
  m='6020'>as a reference frame within which we can describe</span> <span
  m='8520'>the kinematics of an object.</span> </p><p><span m='10330'>By "the
  kinematics," I mean the position, the velocity,</span> <span m='13120'>and the
  acceleration as a function of time,</span> <span m='15230'>basically a
  geometric description of the motion.</span> </p><p><span m='18170'>Some
  aspects of these kinematics will look different</span> <span m='20549'>in
  different reference frames and I'd</span> <span m='22090'>like to examine that
  now.</span> </p><p><span m='23740'>First, I want to define what I mean by an
  "inertial reference</span> <span m='27151'>frame."</span> <span m='27650'>An
  inertial reference frame is one</span> <span m='29066'>in which an isolated
  body, one with no net force acting on it,</span> <span m='33160'>moves at
  constant velocity, where that constant velocity</span> <span m='35730'>might
  be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='37347'>Another way of saying this is that an
  inertial reference</span> <span m='39680'>frame is one in which Newton's laws
  of motion apply.</span> </p><p><span m='43270'>Recall that Newton's first law
  of motion</span> <span m='45110'>states that an isolated object with no forces
  acting on it</span> <span m='48160'>moves at constant velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='50530'>So let's begin by considering an observer</span> <span
  m='53117'>in a particular reference frame.</span> </p><p><span m='54450'>We'll
  call that reference frame S and denote it</span> <span m='57040'>by coordinate
  axes x and y.</span> </p><p><span m='60900'>And let's consider an object that
  in that reference frame</span> <span m='66500'>is at a position vector small
  r.</span> </p><p><span m='69450'>We can then consider a second reference
  frame, which</span> <span m='71730'>I'll call the frame S prime, and
  I'll</span> <span m='73950'>denote that with coordinate axes x prime and y
  prime.</span> </p><p><span m='78020'>In my example here, I'm going to
  assume</span> <span m='80310'>that the coordinate axes in frame S prime are
  parallel to</span> <span m='84640'>but displaced away from the coordinate axes
  in frame</span> <span m='89370'>S. More generally, we could have the S prime
  coordinate axes</span> <span m='93840'>rotated with respect to the frame S
  axes.</span> </p><p><span m='96554'>That's a complication I'm not going to add
  now</span> <span m='98470'>but conceptually, it's not really different.</span>
  </p><p><span m='100650'>For simplicity, we'll stick to parallel axes in this
  example.</span> </p><p><span m='105539'>So imagine we have two observers,
  one</span> <span m='108120'>in frame S at the origin and one at the origin of
  frame S prime,</span> <span m='111960'>both looking at the same object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114330'>Observer S will measure a position vector little
  r.</span> </p><p><span m='119289'>Observer S prime will measure a position
  vector little r prime.</span> </p><p><span m='125090'>The two observers have a
  relative position vector,</span> <span m='128650'>capital R, which is the
  position of S prime relative</span> <span m='132670'>to the origin of frame
  S.</span> </p><p><span m='134980'>So what we'd like to see is how are these
  different position</span> <span m='138120'>vectors related.</span>
  </p><p><span m='139030'>Well, from the geometry of the diagram,</span> <span
  m='141950'>we can see that the position measured by observer S, which</span>
  <span m='146710'>is just little r, is equal to the position of observer
  S</span> <span m='154700'>prime relative to observer S, which</span> <span
  m='156950'>is capital R, plus the position vector measured</span> <span
  m='162500'>by the observer at S prime, which is little r prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='168010'>I can rewrite that if I'd like to write the position
  measured</span> <span m='172160'>by the observer at S prime in terms of
  what's</span> <span m='175160'>measured by the observer at S. I could
  just</span> <span m='177290'>rearrange this and write that little r</span>
  <span m='179530'>prime is equal to little r minus capital R.</span>
  </p><p><span m='187620'>Now let's add a further complication</span> <span
  m='190350'>and assume that the observer S prime is not</span> <span
  m='194620'>just at a different location from the observer of S</span> <span
  m='197320'>but is moving at constant velocity relative to frame S.</span>
  </p><p><span m='200990'>So we'll assume that frame S prime is moving</span>
  <span m='205120'>at constant velocity with respect</span> <span m='206820'>to
  frame S at a constant velocity vector V.</span> </p><p><span m='211690'>So V
  vector is a constant.</span> </p><p><span m='221070'>And in that case, my
  offset of observer</span> <span m='225740'>S prime relative to observer S,
  which is the vector capital R,</span> <span m='229470'>is a function of
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='232910'>So capital R is a function of time</span>
  <span m='235730'>and it's given by the offset at time 0, which</span> <span
  m='239310'>I will call capital R0, plus the elapsed motion</span> <span
  m='247820'>due to the constant velocity, which is capital V times time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='254620'>So since capital R is a function of time, that tells
  me</span> <span m='258160'>that in this equation, little r prime, the position
  vector</span> <span m='262950'>measured by the observer in frame S
  prime,</span> <span m='266580'>is also going to be a function of time,</span>
  <span m='268600'>even if capital-- sorry-- even if little r is a
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='273770'>So notice what that means.</span>
  </p><p><span m='274880'>If the object is at rest in frame S,</span> <span
  m='280310'>the object will appear to be moving.</span> </p><p><span
  m='283280'>Its position vector will be time-dependent in frame S prime</span>
  <span m='287300'>because capital R, the location of S prime relative to
  S</span> <span m='291390'>is changing.</span> </p><p><span m='293159'>So this
  relation tells us how the position vectors in the two</span> <span
  m='297200'>frames are related.</span> </p><p><span m='298820'>What about the
  velocities?</span> </p><p><span m='301520'>Well, to compute how the velocities
  are related,</span> <span m='304390'>we can just take the time derivative of
  the relation</span> <span m='307100'>of the position vectors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='308620'>So in this particular case, we have</span> <span
  m='310740'>that the time derivative of the S prime position,</span> <span
  m='315930'>d little r prime dt, is equal to the time</span> <span
  m='318870'>derivative of the position in frame S, which is d little r</span>
  <span m='324270'>dt, minus the time derivative of the offset of S prime
  relative</span> <span m='330060'>to S. So that's minus d capital R dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='336480'>And I can rewrite that in terms of symbols for the
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='340070'>So I have here the velocity little v
  prime, which</span> <span m='344659'>is the velocity measured by an observer
  in frame S prime,</span> <span m='347750'>and that's equal to the velocity of
  little v, which</span> <span m='351040'>is the velocity measured by frame
  S,</span> <span m='354030'>minus d capital R dt, which we see</span> <span
  m='357480'>is just capital V vector, which is the velocity of S</span> <span
  m='363950'>prime relative to S. So this is how the velocities are
  related.</span> </p><p><span m='368060'>And again, notice that if the object
  is stationary in one</span> <span m='372360'>frame-- so if it's 0 in one
  frame,</span> <span m='377515'>it will be nonzero in the other frame.</span>
  </p><p><span m='380140'>So in general, you will measure different
  velocities</span> <span m='383370'>in the different frames, even if one of
  those velocities is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='388240'>Now, how are the
  accelerations related?</span> </p><p><span m='390740'>Well, again, we can just
  take the time derivative</span> <span m='393159'>of the velocities to figure
  out what</span> <span m='396140'>the relationship of the accelerations
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='398360'>So differentiating this equation,</span>
  <span m='400280'>I have that d little v prime dt is</span> <span
  m='405300'>equal to d little v dt minus d capital V dt.</span> </p><p><span
  m='414905'>But here, something interesting happens because remember,</span>
  <span m='417280'>we said that capital V is a constant vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='421080'>And remember, capital V is the velocity</span> <span
  m='424120'>that frame S prime has relative to frame S.</span> </p><p><span
  m='428760'>So since capital V is a constant, that</span> <span
  m='431820'>means that this term goes to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='435530'>And
  so we see that the acceleration in frame S prime</span> <span m='439630'>is
  equal to the acceleration in frame a.</span> </p><p><span m='443900'>So if I
  have two reference frames, one moving</span> <span m='447410'>at a constant
  velocity relative to the other, in general,</span> <span m='451980'>I will
  measure different positions</span> <span m='454450'>and different velocities
  for an object as</span> <span m='457710'>measured by the two frames.</span>
  </p><p><span m='459380'>However, the accelerations measured in both
  frames</span> <span m='463180'>will be identical.</span> </p><p><span
  m='466990'>Because the accelerations are identical,</span> <span
  m='469580'>we'll see that Newton's laws will look identical</span> <span
  m='472380'>in the two frames.</span> </p><p><span m='474770'>And we can see
  that in the following way.</span> </p><p><span m='477370'>In frame S, we have
  that the force</span> <span m='481960'>is equal to the mass times the
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='485520'>In frame S prime, the force F
  prime</span> <span m='490050'>is equal to the mass times a prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='496530'>But a prime is equal to a, as we calculated
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='505710'>So we see that the forces in the two
  frames</span> <span m='508970'>are identical, even though the positions and
  velocities</span> <span m='513039'>in general will be different, as measured
  in the two</span> <span m='515789'>frames for the same object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='518289'>But the accelerations will be identical</span> <span
  m='520799'>and so the forces will be identical.</span> </p><p><span
  m='523289'>So if one of these reference frames</span> <span m='525840'>is an
  inertial frame, one in which</span> <span m='528740'>an isolated body moves at
  constant velocity,</span> <span m='532840'>then any other frame moving at
  constant velocity with respect</span> <span m='535910'>to the first frame will
  also be an inertial frame.</span> </p><p><span m='540980'>What this means is
  that you're always</span> <span m='543450'>free to transform from one inertial
  frame to another.</span> </p><p><span m='551080'>And what that means is that
  you can always</span> <span m='553200'>transform to another frame that is
  moving</span> <span m='555720'>at constant velocity with respect</span> <span
  m='557940'>to an original inertial frame.</span> </p><p></p>
