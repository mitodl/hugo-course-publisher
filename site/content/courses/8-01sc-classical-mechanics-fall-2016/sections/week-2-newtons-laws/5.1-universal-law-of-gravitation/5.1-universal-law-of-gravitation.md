title: 5.1 Universal Law of Gravitation
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3450'>The motion of objects in space is</span> <span
  m='5420'>governed by the universal law of gravity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8690'>So let's consider how this works.</span> </p><p><span m='11670'>We
  have two objects here, object one and two.</span> </p><p><span m='16856'>And
  that could be two planets or two asteroids</span> <span m='20260'>or two white
  dwarfs, black holes, any kind</span> <span m='24240'>of objects you can
  imagine.</span> </p><p><span m='26490'>And they are mutually attracted by each
  other due to</span> <span m='30390'>gravitation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='31570'>So we have a gravitational force and we label this as F.</span>
  </p><p><span m='40460'>And this is the force on object one</span> <span
  m='42820'>due to the interaction between the bodies one and two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='46930'>And here we have a force on object two</span> <span
  m='53690'>due to the interaction between objects one and two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='58090'>And the objects are separated by a distance r1,
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='65600'>Now, we want to derive the universal law of
  gravitation.</span> </p><p><span m='68900'>How are we going to go about
  that?</span> </p><p><span m='71670'>Well, Newton figured out a while
  ago</span> <span m='73990'>that it is proportional to the masses of objects
  one and two.</span> </p><p><span m='78350'>So this one has a mass m2 and this
  one has m1.</span> </p><p><span m='84500'>And it is also proportional to the
  square of the distance</span> <span m='88910'>between the two objects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='91910'>Now, we need to do one more consideration</span> <span
  m='95539'>and then we can derive this.</span> </p><p><span m='97390'>We need
  to actually-- well, first,</span> <span m='100580'>we need to pick some kind
  of origin</span> <span m='102280'>from where we are considering these two
  objects to be.</span> </p><p><span m='106729'>And this object here goes from
  the origin to there</span> <span m='111509'>and we call this r1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114240'>And then we have here r2, which also</span> <span
  m='120140'>means that the distance here between object one and two</span>
  <span m='127170'>is r1, 2.</span> </p><p><span m='131860'>And actually, we
  know from vector decomposition</span> <span m='134670'>that r1, 2 equals r2
  minus r1.</span> </p><p><span m='141820'>So just this minus this gives us this
  distance here.</span> </p><p><span m='147160'>Now, if we want to write down
  the universal law</span> <span m='150320'>of gravitation, there's a magnitude
  component to it</span> <span m='155280'>and we also need a direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='158130'>And we haven't yet chosen a coordinate system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='162370'>We could, of course, choose our usual way</span> <span
  m='164920'>of placing the i-hat direction in the x-direction</span> <span
  m='169200'>and the j-hat coordinate in the y-direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='172480'>But when we deal with the universal law of gravitation,</span>
  <span m='175320'>it's actually better to adopt a slightly different</span>
  <span m='177620'>coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='179040'>Everything
  in space usually orbits one another</span> <span m='182050'>so it's much
  better to think in a radial direction rather</span> <span m='185240'>than just
  normal Cartesian coordinates.</span> </p><p><span m='189030'>And so in this
  case, we're going to choose an r-hat vector which</span> <span
  m='192830'>gives us a radial direction and we're going to do this here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='197480'>So this is going to be our r-hat direction on object
  two.</span> </p><p><span m='205060'>And here, we have an r-hat direction 2,
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='209820'>One And we're going to come back to the
  r-hat unit</span> <span m='216780'>vectors later.</span> </p><p><span
  m='218120'>For now, we can just write here quickly down the definition</span>
  <span m='221880'>for a unit factor.</span> </p><p><span m='224750'>So our
  r-hat 1,2 is, of course, the vector itself, r1, 2,</span> <span
  m='230720'>divided over the magnitude of the vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='234350'>We can write it like this.</span> </p><p><span m='237450'>And now
  we can write down the gravitational law.</span> </p><p><span m='243220'>So the
  force on object-- we're going to look at object two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='248780'>The force on object two due to the interaction between
  objects</span> <span m='252840'>one and two is proportional to the mass of the
  two objects--</span> <span m='261805'>we already said that in the
  beginning--</span> <span m='263430'>and the square of the distance between the
  two objects.</span> </p><p><span m='270440'>But what about the
  direction?</span> </p><p><span m='273610'>The direction here, we're looking at
  object two.</span> </p><p><span m='276860'>We placed our r-hat unit vector to
  point down</span> <span m='282200'>but the force is going in the opposite
  direction--</span> <span m='284750'>so in the negative r1, 2 hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='288370'>So we have to add a minus here and
  then our 1, 2 r-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='295330'>And as it is the case with
  most of these laws,</span> <span m='298890'>it has a proportionality
  constant</span> <span m='301700'>and Newton called this capital G. And G, as
  we know it today</span> <span m='307180'>from experiment, is 6.67 10 to the
  minus 11.</span> </p><p><span m='314340'>And then in terms of units, we have
  Newton.</span> </p><p><span m='318110'>Force goes in Newton.</span>
  </p><p><span m='319230'>We have mass.</span> </p><p><span m='322990'>This is
  kilogram squared and we have meter squared.</span> </p><p><span m='332800'>So
  those are the units.</span> </p><p><span m='336220'>And if you plug those in,
  then the units of the whole equation</span> <span m='339260'>will work
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='340550'>So let's quickly consider the force in
  object one</span> <span m='343370'>to see what's happening over there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='345740'>So we have F2, 1 equals minus G m1 m2 over r1, 2
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='357110'>And in terms of the unit vector, we
  now</span> <span m='359340'>have r2, 1 hat here going.</span> </p><p><span
  m='363730'>So again, this minus goes with this unit factor</span> <span
  m='367020'>and that one is pointing here in the opposite direction</span>
  <span m='369640'>than our force.</span> </p><p><span m='371730'>So that's all
  good.</span> </p><p><span m='372780'>But what we see from this one here-- and
  actually</span> <span m='376210'>from our diagram already-- that r1, 2 equals
  minus r2, 1.</span> </p><p><span m='386360'>And so we see from this then that
  actually,</span> <span m='391010'>Newton's third law, every action has an
  equal and opposite</span> <span m='396200'>reaction, is true for this little
  setup here,</span> <span m='402500'>as well, because the forces are of
  opposite direction</span> <span m='408330'>and of equal magnitude.</span> </p>
