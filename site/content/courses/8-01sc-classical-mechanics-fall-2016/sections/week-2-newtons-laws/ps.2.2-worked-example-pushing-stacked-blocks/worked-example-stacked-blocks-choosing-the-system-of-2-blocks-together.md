  <p><span m='3630'>When we analyze the problem about putting</span> <span
  m='6510'>two blocks along a frictionless surface</span> <span m='9320'>and
  pushing one and asking, what is the maximum force such</span> <span
  m='13050'>that block 2 does not slip?</span> </p><p><span m='15290'>We have
  three different systems.</span> </p><p><span m='16910'>And now I want to focus
  a little bit</span> <span m='18700'>on what would happen if we just naively
  chose our systems</span> <span m='23010'>as both blocks together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='25230'>So let's try to look at the types of issues</span>
  <span m='29050'>that come up when we do that.</span> </p><p><span m='31190'>So
  once again, let's draw free body diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='34890'>Now,
  we begin.</span> </p><p><span m='36270'>We're pushing block 1 with a
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='40290'>Gravitation is the sum of these two
  forces,</span> <span m='45160'>because our system here is block 1 and block
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='52560'>What about normal forces?</span> </p><p><span
  m='54620'>Well, the ground is acting on block 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='59580'>And now, here's the significant thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='62230'>What about all of those forces between blocks 1 and 2?</span>
  </p><p><span m='66980'>Well, the forces between blocks 1 and 2 are internal
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='82490'>And we saw that they were friction
  forces, f12 and f21.</span> </p><p><span m='88900'>This was the friction force
  between the two blocks,</span> <span m='92200'>on block 2 due to 1 and the
  friction force on block 1</span> <span m='95800'>due to 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='96960'>There were normal forces between these two blocks,</span> <span
  m='100800'>but these are interaction pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='107900'>And
  the sum of them are 0.</span> </p><p><span m='111930'>And so we see that all
  internal forces form Newton's third law</span> <span m='118210'>interaction
  pairs and the vector sum of them are 0.</span> </p><p><span m='121450'>And
  that's why I don't need those internal forces</span> <span m='125260'>on my
  free body diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='126990'>If I were to draw them, I
  would have different arrows.</span> </p><p><span m='129840'>For instance, I
  would have that arrow f21</span> <span m='134210'>and I would have the arrow
  f12.</span> </p><p><span m='136920'>And you can see that the sum of those
  cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='140570'>I would have the arrow n21 and I would
  have the arrow n12.</span> </p><p><span m='148680'>Arrows in opposite
  directions.</span> </p><p><span m='151500'>The interaction pairs sum to 0,
  because they</span> <span m='156360'>are internal forces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='158530'>And again, this enables us now to just draw</span> <span
  m='163340'>f equals m1 plus m2 times the acceleration of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='170390'>And so we have our i hat and our j hat
  directions.</span> </p><p><span m='174310'>Let's pick i hat and j hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='177352'>And now, we didn't include the kinetic friction
  force</span> <span m='183180'>of the ground in that system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='185550'>So let's make sure that that's there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='187980'>And what we have is f minus f kinetic</span> <span
  m='192330'>equals m1 plus m2 times a.</span> </p><p><span m='197565'>And in
  the vertical direction, we</span> <span m='198940'>have n ground 1 minus m1
  plus m2 g equals 0.</span> </p><p><span m='205200'>That gave us our same
  result before.</span> </p><p><span m='207870'>Notice that f equals fk plus m1
  plus m2 g.</span> </p><p><span m='214650'>We know this is mu km1 plus m2 g
  plus m1 plus m2 g a.</span> </p><p><span m='227690'>So we have the
  acceleration of the system</span> <span m='234490'>depends on the force, mu k
  m1 plus m2g divided by m1 m2.</span> </p><p><span m='243890'>But notice
  because our static friction</span> <span m='248300'>is an internal force in
  this system,</span> <span m='250480'>it never shows up in Newton's second
  law,</span> <span m='254030'>so we were never able to apply the
  condition</span> <span m='257790'>that f static max was mu static n,</span>
  <span m='263790'>what we call the normal force between the blocks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='266310'>And so we were unable to figure out what is the
  maximum force.</span> </p><p><span m='270900'>All we can say is if I push f,
  that's the acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='275690'>But I cannot determine
  what maximum force will cause block</span> <span m='280020'>2 to slip with
  respect to block 1.</span> </p><p><span m='283570'>So when you pick your
  system like this,</span> <span m='286100'>it's very quick to calculate
  a.</span> </p><p><span m='288730'>No problem about that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='289990'>But I am not able to answer any questions that</span> <span
  m='293930'>require some type of information about the internal forces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='298760'>So the art to choosing systems and free body
  diagrams</span> <span m='303160'>is to think about the types of questions
  you're asking.</span> </p><p><span m='306980'>If you have a question that
  involves something</span> <span m='309120'>about a maximum condition on static
  friction,</span> <span m='311950'>then you want to make sure that static
  friction is</span> <span m='315160'>an external force to your system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='318270'>If it's an internal force, like in this case,</span>
  <span m='320800'>you will not be able to apply that condition.</span>
