  Worked Example - Stacked Blocks - Free Body Diagrams and Applying Newton's 2nd
  Law
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3240'>One of the big difficulties students</span> <span
  m='4750'>have in a problem that involves many objects is</span> <span
  m='7630'>to successfully identify third law interaction pairs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='11820'>So today, I'd like to look at a problem which shows
  us</span> <span m='15210'>how to think about that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='17160'>So what we're going to look at is third law interaction
  pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='22960'>Now, the problem I'd like to consider is
  the following.</span> </p><p><span m='25500'>Suppose we have a block one and
  another block two sitting</span> <span m='29700'>on block one on a surface and
  our surface has friction.</span> </p><p><span m='35470'>And I'd like to push
  block one with a force F.</span> </p><p><span m='41260'>And now I'd like to
  use Newton's second law to determine</span> <span m='46040'>what is the
  maximum force I can push that block two will not</span> <span
  m='50600'>slip.</span> </p><p><span m='51310'>So I'm trying to find F max such
  that block two does not slip.</span> </p><p><span m='64239'>Now, how do we
  even begin to think about this?</span> </p><p><span m='67510'>Well, the first
  thing that we have to decide</span> <span m='70850'>is when we apply Newton's
  second law, our first question will</span> <span m='75430'>be, what is the
  system that we'll choose?</span> </p><p><span m='85360'>And in this problem,
  there are three separate ways</span> <span m='88700'>to think about
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='89690'>Just to show you an example, so system a
  will be block one,</span> <span m='95210'>system b will be block two, and
  system c</span> <span m='101740'>will be block one and block two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='105150'>And given these different systems,</span> <span
  m='107420'>I can address different questions</span> <span m='111280'>and we'll
  see that as we develop this.</span> </p><p><span m='114190'>So let's start
  with block one and we'll</span> <span m='119289'>start with breaking our
  problem down into block one</span> <span m='123560'>and block two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='124800'>And let's draw the free-body diagrams on those
  blocks,</span> <span m='127620'>trying to identify action-reaction
  pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='130820'>So let's begin with block one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='133650'>First off, we know there's gravitational force</span>
  <span m='137090'>and the Earth is the other pair there, which we're not
  drawing.</span> </p><p><span m='140890'>There's friction between the
  surfaces.</span> </p><p><span m='143829'>So there's a friction between the
  ground and block one.</span> </p><p><span m='149640'>There is the normal force
  of the ground on block one.</span> </p><p><span m='154770'>Block two is
  sitting on block one</span> <span m='157730'>so there's a normal force of
  block two on block one.</span> </p><p><span m='163070'>And finally, as you
  push block one,</span> <span m='167710'>there's a friction force between block
  two</span> <span m='170840'>and block one that's opposing the fact that block
  one is</span> <span m='175050'>being pushed forward.</span> </p><p><span
  m='176829'>So we have a friction force here between blocks two and one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='184960'>Now, this friction down here is kinetic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='189610'>But if the blocks are moving together,</span> <span
  m='191910'>this friction here is static.</span> </p><p><span m='196329'>So
  those are the free-body force diagrams on one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='199420'>I'll choose unit vectors in a moment.</span> </p><p><span
  m='201660'>Now, what about two?</span> </p><p><span m='203780'>So let's draw
  two.</span> </p><p><span m='206180'>Well, again, m2 g-- the Earth is the other
  element</span> <span m='210150'>of the interaction pair.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211850'>And now, block one is pushing block two up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='217870'>So we have block one pushing block two up and notice</span> <span
  m='222290'>our indices make it very easy to see that our first Newton's</span>
  <span m='227730'>third law interaction pair is the normal force of
  contact</span> <span m='231460'>between the two blocks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='233620'>Now, what else?</span> </p><p><span m='235600'>Here's the subtle
  thing is that this whole system will</span> <span m='240360'>move to the
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='241500'>What's the force that's making block two
  move to the right?</span> </p><p><span m='245450'>Well, it's static
  friction.</span> </p><p><span m='248790'>So static friction from block one and
  block</span> <span m='253480'>two-- this is the static friction--</span> <span
  m='256070'>is causing block two to move to the right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='260269'>And now we can see, again our third law interaction pair.</span>
  </p><p><span m='266940'>So in this problem, we have two third law pairs, this
  one</span> <span m='270690'>and I'll connect the line there, and those are the
  third law</span> <span m='277040'>pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='278680'>Now,
  we know by the third law that they're equal and opposite</span> <span
  m='283710'>in magnitude.</span> </p><p><span m='284909'>We can identify
  f.</span> </p><p><span m='287180'>We can call this one N if we wanted
  just</span> <span m='290600'>to save ourselves the problem of writing a lot of
  indices.</span> </p><p><span m='295540'>Once we've done that, we're now ready
  to apply</span> <span m='298210'>Newton's second law.</span> </p><p><span
  m='299500'>We haven't yet figured out what the condition is</span> <span
  m='301680'>that it will just slip.</span> </p><p><span m='303030'>We'll get to
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='304430'>But for the moment, we can now apply
  vector decomposition.</span> </p><p><span m='308010'>So we need to choose some
  unit vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='310820'>Because I'm pushing the system
  this way, it makes sense for me</span> <span m='314100'>to choose my i-hat to
  the right.</span> </p><p><span m='316590'>So here, I'm going to choose i-hat 1
  and j-hat 1.</span> </p><p><span m='322720'>Now, over here, I could choose the
  same unit vectors,</span> <span m='327380'>even though I'm thinking about
  this</span> <span m='329060'>as a completely separate problem with its own
  coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='332970'>And I'll choose i-hat 2 and
  j-hat 2.</span> </p><p><span m='337350'>But because these unit vectors are in
  the same direction,</span> <span m='340240'>they're equal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='341840'>And they're both moving in the positive i directions</span> <span
  m='345220'>and so I expect both a1 and a2 to be positive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='351100'>And now I on block one, I can write down F1 equals m1 a1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='364170'>And because we have two different directions,</span>
  <span m='368360'>I'll separate out.</span> </p><p><span m='369950'>I like to
  call this my "scorecard."</span> <span m='372300'>And now I look at the
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='375150'>Oh, I missed the pushing force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='379772'>But that's an interesting exercise.</span>
  </p><p><span m='381230'>When I looked at this diagram, I saw</span> <span
  m='383700'>I had two forces going this way.</span> </p><p><span m='385260'>I
  had no force acting that way.</span> </p><p><span m='386870'>I went
  back.</span> </p><p><span m='387990'>I checked my free-body diagram, and
  recognized</span> <span m='391080'>that I forgot to put F in there--
  always</span> <span m='394220'>a good exercise to double-check your free-body
  diagrams</span> <span m='397280'>before you apply Newton's laws.</span>
  </p><p><span m='399830'>So now in the x-direction, we have the pushing
  force</span> <span m='405540'>minus the static friction minus-- we'll</span>
  <span m='408960'>call this fk-- minus the kinetic friction</span> <span
  m='414260'>and that's equal to m1 a1.</span> </p><p><span m='417650'>Now in
  the vertical direction, we</span> <span m='420180'>have the ground friction, N
  ground</span> <span m='423970'>1, minus block two pushing down on block
  one</span> <span m='429110'>minus the gravitational force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='431450'>And there is no acceleration in that direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='435150'>And I double-check my free-body diagrams, I check my signs,</span>
  <span m='439160'>and that looks right to me.</span> </p><p><span
  m='440990'>Now, for block two, I'll apply the same analysis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='445850'>F2 equals m2 a2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='449530'>Separate out my two unit directions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='452930'>Notice even though these unit vectors are the same,</span> <span
  m='456534'>I'm emphasizing that I'm talking about block two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='459760'>I could have chosen different coordinate systems if I
  wanted.</span> </p><p><span m='462670'>Now, I look at my free-body
  diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='465100'>On block two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='466320'>I see that its static friction is</span> <span m='468020'>the only
  one in the positive i-hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='470940'>So I have
  F equals m2 a2.</span> </p><p><span m='476750'>And in the vertical directions,
  I</span> <span m='479590'>have that my force between the blocks, the normal
  force</span> <span m='483790'>between the blocks, minus gravity is 0.</span>
