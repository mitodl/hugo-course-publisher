  <p><span m='3980'>And now I'm in position to talk about what</span> <span
  m='8530'>is the maximum force.</span> </p><p><span m='10650'>If I push F
  harder, as if I push F and the blocks go together,</span> <span m='15810'>the
  accelerations are the same.</span> </p><p><span m='18480'>I push F
  harder.</span> </p><p><span m='19900'>Accelerations are the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m='21460'>I push F harder, and I push F so hard,</span> <span
  m='25650'>that the static friction no longer reaches</span> <span
  m='30580'>its maximum value.</span> </p><p><span m='33580'>And if I push F
  harder than that,</span> <span m='36800'>I will not have-- the static
  friction</span> <span m='39210'>can't get bigger, and the blocks 1 and 2 will
  start</span> <span m='42880'>to slip relative to each other.</span>
  </p><p><span m='45290'>So my no slipping condition is that I want two
  things.</span> </p><p><span m='53080'>a1 equals a2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='55020'>We'll call that a.</span> </p><p><span m='56456'>And the maximum
  force condition is that F static</span> <span m='66730'>is equal to maximum
  value.</span> </p><p><span m='73050'>Now, what is the normal force between
  that we refer to</span> <span m='79380'>in our fiction law?</span>
  </p><p><span m='80600'>There's two normal forces-- the ground</span> <span
  m='83480'>and the normal force between the surfaces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='85740'>But the static friction that we're talking about</span> <span
  m='88250'>is between the surfaces.</span> </p><p><span m='90230'>So that's why
  we use N here and not N ground.</span> </p><p><span m='95430'>And now I can
  solve for this F max.</span> </p><p><span m='100520'>By the way, we also have
  the condition that fk is mu k.</span> </p><p><span m='105690'>What normal
  force are we talking about?</span> </p><p><span m='108280'>N, which we've
  called N ground 1.</span> </p><p><span m='113830'>And now I look at my
  equations, and my goal</span> <span m='117020'>is to solve for F. I know Ng1
  from this equation.</span> </p><p><span m='123460'>It's just equal to M1g plus
  N. I Know N from that equation.</span> </p><p><span m='129169'>So Ng1 is just
  the sum of the masses times g.</span> </p><p><span m='132600'>So I know
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='134570'>I have f, which is m2a.</span>
  </p><p><span m='137904'>And I can now apply my result.</span> </p><p><span
  m='144550'>So what we'll do is we'll solve for the a's, a1 equals a2,</span>
  <span m='151740'>in terms of F max.</span> </p><p><span m='154070'>So over
  here we have that a is f over m2.</span> </p><p><span m='159990'>That's from
  this equation.</span> </p><p><span m='163360'>And now I'll substitute a1 is
  equal to that.</span> </p><p><span m='167650'>I'll substitute that
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='169990'>And I get that F Max is going to
  be</span> <span m='175579'>equal to fk plus f static max.</span> </p><p><span
  m='184680'>That's that one.</span> </p><p><span m='186900'>Plus m1 times a1,
  which is f static max divided by m2.</span> </p><p><span m='196460'>And so I
  get that F max equals-- now</span> <span m='201970'>I'm going to substitute in
  all of these values.</span> </p><p><span m='205230'>It's going to look a
  little complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='207590'>And so I'd like to have a
  little space here for that,</span> <span m='212070'>to get everything in
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='218980'>And we'll see that it's equal to mu k m1
  plus m2g, fk, mu k,</span> <span m='229870'>plus m1 2mg plus f static max
  times 1 plus and m1 over m2.</span> </p><p><span m='236770'>But f static max
  is mu N, and N is m2g.</span> </p><p><span m='241860'>So I get m2g times 1
  plus m1 over m2.</span> </p><p><span m='248980'>And there is, if I push any
  harder than that,</span> <span m='254110'>block 2 will slip with respect to
  block 1.</span> </p><p><span m='257350'>Again, all of our terms have the
  dimensions of acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='262050'>This is
  dimensionless-- 1, dimensions of acceleration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='266110'>And we did miss one little thing.</span> </p><p><span m='269150'>We
  missed the coefficient of static friction.</span> </p><p><span m='273820'>And
  there we have it, a tricky problem.</span> </p><p></p>
