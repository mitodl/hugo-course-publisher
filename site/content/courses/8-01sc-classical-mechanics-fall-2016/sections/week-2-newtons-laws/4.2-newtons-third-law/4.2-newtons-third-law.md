title: 4.2 Newton's Third Law
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3940'>Newton's third law states that forces always come</span>
  <span m='6820'>in equal and opposite pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='10650'>One
  way we can write that is if you imagine two objects,</span> <span
  m='13100'>object one and object two, the force exerted by object one</span>
  <span m='18790'>on object two is equal and opposite to the force
  exerted</span> <span m='24000'>by object two on object one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='28000'>This makes explicit that real forces always
  arise</span> <span m='31400'>from a physical interaction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='33090'>For any force in a problem, you should always</span> <span
  m='35390'>be able to identify the other member of the interaction pair.</span>
  </p><p><span m='42150'>Newton's third law is the most subtle</span> <span
  m='44660'>and sometimes the most confusing of his three laws of motion</span>
  <span m='47690'>so I'd like to do an example that will help</span> <span
  m='50050'>clarify how to think about it.</span> </p><p><span m='51850'>So I'm
  going to pick a very extreme example.</span> </p><p><span m='53850'>Let's
  imagine the collision between a marble moving</span> <span m='60580'>this way
  and a train moving that way.</span> </p><p><span m='68670'>And so we'll say
  that the mass of the train--</span> <span m='70910'>I'll write that as "m sub
  train"--</span> <span m='74270'>and the mass of the marble is m sub
  marble.</span> </p><p><span m='79840'>And obviously, the mass of the
  train</span> <span m='82740'>is much larger-- I'm going to write that</span>
  <span m='84450'>as several greater-than signs-- much, much larger</span> <span
  m='87980'>than the mass of the marble.</span> </p><p><span m='94520'>And so
  the question I want to consider is, at the instant</span> <span m='97009'>that
  these two objects collide, which experiences the greater</span> <span
  m='100880'>force?</span> </p><p><span m='102410'>So think about that yourself
  for a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='105289'>In terms of outcomes, clearly,
  the marble</span> <span m='108280'>will be smashed by the train whereas the
  train will not</span> <span m='111320'>be noticeably affected by the
  marble.</span> </p><p><span m='113560'>So your intuition might
  therefore</span> <span m='115030'>suggest that it's the marble that feels the
  greater force.</span> </p><p><span m='118539'>But that's incorrect because
  Newton's third law tells us</span> <span m='122890'>that forces come in equal
  and opposite pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='126430'>And what that tells us is
  that each object</span> <span m='129020'>will exert an equal but oppositely
  directed</span> <span m='132490'>force on the other.</span> </p><p><span
  m='134120'>Now I chose a very extreme example</span> <span m='136170'>to
  capture your attention.</span> </p><p><span m='138192'>But that might seem
  like a surprising result</span> <span m='140180'>but Newton's third law tells
  us that the forces on each object</span> <span m='143810'>are going to be
  equal and opposite.</span> </p><p><span m='146210'>But just because the forces
  are equal</span> <span m='147900'>doesn't mean that the motion will be
  equal.</span> </p><p><span m='150790'>The accelerations of the two
  objects</span> <span m='152570'>are vastly different because of their
  different masses.</span> </p><p><span m='155470'>And the accelerations and the
  forces</span> <span m='157079'>are related by Newton's second law, F equals m
  a.</span> </p><p><span m='160850'>So if I write that in terms of the
  acceleration,</span> <span m='163340'>the acceleration of the marble, "a
  marble,"</span> <span m='168310'>is equal to the force divided by the mass of
  the marble</span> <span m='177790'>whereas the acceleration of the
  train</span> <span m='182120'>is equal to-- so since I wrote "F" for the force
  acting</span> <span m='184950'>on a marble, I'm going to write minus F for the
  force acting</span> <span m='188540'>on the train.</span> </p><p><span
  m='189490'>So that's minus F divided by the mass of the train.</span>
  </p><p><span m='199270'>And so if I want to look at the ratio, how big
  is</span> <span m='202660'>the acceleration of the marble divided</span> <span
  m='207970'>by the acceleration of the train?</span> </p><p><span
  m='211600'>And let's take the absolute value so we're just</span> <span
  m='213620'>talking about magnitudes here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='216079'>That's going to be equal to the mass of the train divided</span>
  <span m='223340'>by the mass of the marble.</span> </p><p><span m='226900'>But
  the mass of the train is much, much,</span> <span m='229480'>much larger than
  the mass of the marble</span> <span m='231210'>so the right-hand side here is
  a very, very big number.</span> </p><p><span m='234000'>And that tells us that
  relative to the acceleration</span> <span m='236220'>of the train, the
  acceleration of the marble</span> <span m='238110'>is going to be
  enormous.</span> </p><p><span m='239710'>Even though the force experienced by
  each object</span> <span m='242670'>is identical, because of their different
  masses,</span> <span m='245270'>their accelerations will be very
  different.</span> </p><p><span m='247090'>So that gives us an example of
  what</span> <span m='248548'>we mean by Newton's third law, in terms of the
  interaction</span> <span m='253640'>pair and equal and opposite forces
  acting.</span> </p><p><span m='261730'>I want to reiterate that for any force
  in a problem,</span> <span m='265500'>you should always be able to identify
  the other member</span> <span m='268150'>of the interaction pair.</span>
  </p><p><span m='270200'>So forces always come in pairs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='272220'>It's important to keep in mind that these force pairs don't</span>
  <span m='276690'>both act on the same object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='278054'>They never act on the same object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='279470'>The interaction pair always involves</span> <span m='281330'>a pair
  of objects, two different objects.</span> </p><p><span m='283590'>And let me
  just make that explicit with an example.</span> </p><p><span m='286650'>The
  example I'll consider is, imagine a person standing</span> <span m='289900'>on
  the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='296950'>What are the forces acting on this
  person?</span> </p><p><span m='301310'>I'll draw the force diagram here,
  say.</span> </p><p><span m='304940'>There's gravity, mg, acting
  downwards</span> <span m='309660'>and there's a normal force upward exerted by
  the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='315630'>And those two balance to give a net
  force of zero, which</span> <span m='318959'>is why the person is standing on
  the ground</span> <span m='320750'>and not sinking down into the ground, for
  example.</span> </p><p><span m='325610'>Now, you might look at gravity and the
  normal force</span> <span m='329900'>and wonder if those are an interaction
  pair.</span> </p><p><span m='332120'>And they're not because notice that these
  two forces are both</span> <span m='335330'>acting on the same object, the
  person.</span> </p><p><span m='338550'>The interaction pair always
  comes</span> <span m='341460'>from realizing what is exerting the force on the
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='344790'>So let's look at each of these in
  turn.</span> </p><p><span m='347320'>Gravity is exerted by the Earth.</span>
  </p><p><span m='350000'>So if the Earth-- and this means really the entire
  Earth--</span> <span m='353180'>exerts a force mg on the person, Newton's
  third law</span> <span m='357480'>tells us that the person exerts a
  gravitational force</span> <span m='360860'>on the entire Earth of mg
  upwards.</span> </p><p><span m='365800'>Now, that might seem remarkable to
  you</span> <span m='367750'>if you're just standing around on the floor</span>
  <span m='370210'>that you are exerting a gravitational force</span> <span
  m='372480'>on the planet but you are.</span> </p><p><span m='374352'>However,
  this is like the example we just</span> <span m='376060'>talked about a moment
  ago.</span> </p><p><span m='378200'>The masses are extremely different</span>
  <span m='379820'>even though the forces are the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='381320'>So the acceleration of the Earth due to this person's mass</span>
  <span m='385290'>is negligible because the Earth is so much more</span> <span
  m='387490'>massive than the person.</span> </p><p><span m='388740'>But
  Newton's third law tells us that there</span> <span m='390680'>is a tiny
  acceleration on the Earth due to the person.</span> </p><p><span
  m='394290'>That is the third law pair for gravity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='396970'>mg downward exerted by the Earth on the person</span> <span
  m='400680'>is paired with mg upward on the Earth exerted by the person.</span>
  </p><p><span m='406680'>Now, for the normal force acting on the person,</span>
  <span m='409270'>that force is exerted by the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m='412620'>So the ground exerts an upward force N on the person.</span>
  </p><p><span m='416030'>Newton's third law tells us that that</span> <span
  m='418360'>means that the person must exert a downward force</span> <span
  m='422130'>N on the ground.</span> </p><p><span m='424280'>That is the
  interaction pair for Newton's third law</span> <span m='427930'>for the normal
  force.</span> </p><p></p>
