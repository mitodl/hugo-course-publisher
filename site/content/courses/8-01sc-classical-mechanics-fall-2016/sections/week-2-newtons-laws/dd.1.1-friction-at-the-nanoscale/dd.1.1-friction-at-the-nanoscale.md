transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3010'>So I would like to tell you about friction today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6520'>Friction is a very mysterious subject,</span> <span
  m='8910'>because it has such simple rules at the macroscopic scale,</span>
  <span m='13460'>and yet-- as I will show you and tell you</span> <span
  m='15560'>a little bit about today-- very different rules</span> <span
  m='17850'>at the nanoscopic scale.</span> </p><p><span m='19750'>So I would
  like to tell you about friction at the nano</span> <span
  m='34125'>scale.</span> </p><p><span m='38340'>So at the macro scale, there
  are classic rules that</span> <span m='41090'>were discovered very early
  on.</span> </p><p><span m='43380'>For macroscopic objects, it was
  actually</span> <span m='49020'>Leonardo da Vinci who found the first
  laws</span> <span m='53290'>of so-called "dry" friction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56010'>So this was da Vinci as early as in the 15th century.</span>
  </p><p><span m='63880'>And basically, he discovered that friction
  depends</span> <span m='69810'>on the force, on the weight of the object on
  the surface,</span> <span m='74730'>and that there's a certain coefficient
  that</span> <span m='77150'>depends on the material.</span> </p><p><span
  m='80750'>Da Vinci did not publish his notes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='83810'>They were just hidden in his notebooks for a long time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='87060'>And Amontons in the 17th century rediscovered the very
  same laws</span> <span m='93100'>that da Vinci had found.</span> </p><p><span
  m='97259'>And these are two very simple laws.</span> </p><p><span
  m='101490'>The first law is that if you have an object sliding</span> <span
  m='104509'>on a surface-- so there's a force that you are pulling</span> <span
  m='110270'>on the object, and there's the friction force acting</span> <span
  m='114080'>on it in the opposite direction-- then</span> <span
  m='116780'>Amontons found that the friction force is</span> <span
  m='120980'>proportional to the normal force.</span> </p><p><span m='124990'>So
  the normal force is the weight of the object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131370'>So he found that the friction force</span> <span m='133030'>as a
  function of normal force is just</span> <span m='134710'>the simple
  interdependence.</span> </p><p><span m='136430'>So if you make the object
  twice as heavy,</span> <span m='139230'>the friction force will be twice as
  large.</span> </p><p><span m='143310'>This makes, maybe, sense.</span>
  </p><p><span m='145220'>It agrees with our intuition that maybe an
  object</span> <span m='148430'>twice as heavy should have a force twice as
  large.</span> </p><p><span m='152200'>The second law of friction is much more
  surprising-- namely,</span> <span m='157540'>that if you have two objects of
  the same weight--</span> <span m='163100'>so you have the same normal force--
  but very different</span> <span m='170150'>areas of contact, then the friction
  force is the same.</span> </p><p><span m='174640'>So if you have a friction
  force for this object--</span> <span m='177340'>let me call it friction force
  one--</span> <span m='179110'>and the friction force of this object--
  friction</span> <span m='181420'>force two-- then the friction forces are the
  same.</span> </p><p><span m='186350'>One equals friction force two.</span>
  </p><p><span m='188290'>So surprisingly, the friction force</span> <span
  m='190490'>is independent of contact area.</span> </p><p><span m='203340'>This
  seems very counter-intuitive,</span> <span m='204870'>because if you think of
  friction as some kind of sticking,</span> <span m='207950'>some kind of effect
  where two surfaces rub together,</span> <span m='211520'>then we might naively
  assume that the larger the surface,</span> <span m='214180'>the larger the
  friction force.</span> </p><p><span m='217400'>So one maybe intuition of why
  this might not</span> <span m='220720'>be the case, or one possible
  explanation,</span> <span m='222640'>is that surfaces always have
  roughness.</span> </p><p><span m='225310'>And so the actual contact area
  between two</span> <span m='227920'>surfaces-- so if I really draw the surface
  of the object</span> <span m='232180'>here-- then the actual contact area
  between two surfaces</span> <span m='235140'>might not be the observed area of
  the macroscopic object.</span> </p><p><span m='239520'>And so this may be one
  way to explain why the friction is</span> <span m='243190'>independent of the
  area, because it might only</span> <span m='245450'>be proportional to the
  actual contact area of the system.</span> </p><p><span m='249892'>We have
  already described two of the laws</span> <span m='251600'>of macroscopic
  friction.</span> </p><p><span m='253280'>There's a third law that was actually
  discovered by Coulomb.</span> </p><p><span m='258750'>And again, this is a
  little bit surprising result-- namely,</span> <span m='262860'>that for this
  kind of friction, the dry friction,</span> <span m='267480'>it is independent
  of the velocity of the object.</span> </p><p><span m='269480'>So this is, for
  instance, something that</span> <span m='271146'>is not true for air
  resistance.</span> </p><p><span m='272540'>If you drive a car, the faster you
  go,</span> <span m='275200'>the more friction there is, the more air
  resistance there is.</span> </p><p><span m='277790'>But if you have two
  surfaces sliding on top of each other,</span> <span m='281280'>then Coulomb
  found that the friction force</span> <span m='284640'>is independent of
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='298590'>Again, this is something quite
  counter--</span> <span m='301150'>not quite, but somewhat
  counter-intuitive.</span> </p><p><span m='303290'>And as I will show you a
  little bit later,</span> <span m='305820'>it actually is no longer true
  when</span> <span m='308330'>you look at the nano scale.</span> </p><p><span
  m='310680'>Coulomb was also the first one to distinguish static
  friction,</span> <span m='318020'>which is the force with which an object
  resists</span> <span m='321770'>motion for a while.</span> </p><p><span
  m='323252'>You make the force larger and larger, so for a while,</span> <span
  m='325460'>the object will stick.</span> </p><p><span m='326910'>And then it
  will start sliding.</span> </p><p><span m='328580'>So he distinguished static
  friction from dynamic friction.</span> </p><p><span m='337500'>And because we
  have this law that</span> <span m='339610'>says that the frictional force
  is</span> <span m='341310'>proportional to the normal force,</span> <span
  m='342730'>I will remind you of the first law-- the friction force
  being</span> <span m='348800'>proportional to the normal force,</span> <span
  m='351350'>like so-- we can define a slope.</span> </p><p><span m='358110'>So
  we can write the friction force</span> <span m='360220'>as some slope, mu,
  times the normal force.</span> </p><p><span m='364540'>These are both forces,
  so they have the same units,</span> <span m='366970'>which means that the
  so-called coefficient of friction-- which</span> <span m='371721'>could be
  therefore static frictional</span> <span m='373220'>or for dynamic friction,
  for kinetic friction--</span> <span m='376920'>this coefficient is just a
  number.</span> </p><p><span m='379210'>And typically, this number is between
  0.3 and 0.6.</span> </p><p><span m='390070'>This makes a lot of sense.</span>
  </p><p><span m='392100'>The friction force is not quite as strong as the
  normal force.</span> </p><p><span m='395350'>So the friction force with which
  an object resists motion</span> <span m='399520'>is not quite as large as the
  normal force</span> <span m='401790'>with which it pushes down on a certain
  surface.</span> </p><p><span m='404990'>However, surprisingly, there are
  materials where</span> <span m='408510'>mu is actually larger than 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='410380'>It's possible, for instance, for rubber.</span>
  </p><p><span m='415470'>Which means that an object can be harder to pull
  sideways</span> <span m='419420'>than actually-- it can be harder to pull an
  object sideways</span> <span m='424300'>than to actually lift it from the
  surface.</span> </p><p><span m='427270'>So this is a surprising result.</span>
  </p><p><span m='430980'>Now, it turns out that despite these very simple
  laws,</span> <span m='435270'>our fundamental understanding of friction is
  rather limited.</span> </p><p><span m='438520'>So for instance, nobody in the
  world</span> <span m='440420'>can predict this coefficient mu of
  friction.</span> </p><p><span m='443250'>Nobody in the world can, from
  microscopic or principle</span> <span m='446670'>say-- being told what the two
  surfaces are,</span> <span m='450120'>say plastic or wood-- what is the
  friction coefficient.</span> </p><p><span m='454170'>Can you calculate it for
  me?</span> </p><p><span m='455610'>We cannot predict it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='456990'>We can only measure it, and then tabulate it-- make a
  table--</span> <span m='459630'>and say this kind of object on this kind of
  surface</span> <span m='462490'>has this kind of coefficient for
  friction.</span> </p><p><span m='465920'>So that's one, if you want, failure
  of physics.</span> </p><p><span m='468890'>How is it possible that we can't
  describe, and quantitatively</span> <span m='472730'>describe, something as
  simple as that?</span> </p><p><span m='474950'>Also, in many instances, we
  would</span> <span m='477100'>like to change the coefficient to
  friction.</span> </p><p><span m='479120'>Typically, we would like to reduce
  friction,</span> <span m='481490'>because friction is something where we
  dissipate energy.</span> </p><p><span m='486000'>It is estimated that as much
  as 3% of the nation's GDP</span> <span m='495650'>is "wasted" on
  friction.</span> </p><p><span m='504260'>So friction destroys energy in the
  amount of billions</span> <span m='509810'>and billions of dollars-- cars
  driving on streets,</span> <span m='513340'>machines working, and so
  on.</span> </p><p><span m='515400'>Sometimes friction is, of course,
  desirable.</span> </p><p><span m='517308'>If you want to stop your car on the
  road,</span> <span m='519240'>you want friction to actually work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='521600'>You wouldn't like to do away with it
  completely.</span> </p><p><span m='524760'>But in many instances, it's just a
  source of energy loss.</span> </p><p><span m='529270'>So if we could even make
  a small change in the friction,</span> <span m='533010'>this would be not only
  important for science,</span> <span m='535770'>but it might also be very
  important for technology.</span> </p><p><span m='539330'>So here, I've told
  you about friction</span> <span m='541550'>of macroscopic objects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='544390'>Now people-- chemists, physicists, other
  scientists,</span> <span m='547890'>engineers-- are able to build smaller and
  smaller machines.</span> </p><p><span m='551110'>And there's tremendous
  interest to build nanoscopic machines--</span> <span m='554230'>machines that
  are maybe only a few molecules or a small number</span> <span m='558210'>of
  molecules or atoms wide and big.</span> </p><p><span m='560930'>And there's
  been tremendous success.</span> </p><p><span m='562430'>People have built nano
  pumps-- tiny pumps-- even a tiny car,</span> <span m='567210'>consisting of a
  relatively small number of molecules</span> <span m='569810'>that can move on
  the surface if you inject the electrons.</span> </p><p><span m='572830'>So as
  I would like now to tell you about how bad friction</span> <span m='578390'>is
  at the nano scale.</span> </p><p><span m='579550'>So let's ask the following
  question--</span> <span m='582700'>how bad is friction at the nano
  scale?</span> </p><p><span m='591910'>Your general intuition might be that
  friction</span> <span m='594090'>gets worse at the nano scale, simply because
  the bulk--</span> <span m='598330'>the volume of an object-- is what</span>
  <span m='600940'>determines how many atoms are in it,</span> <span
  m='603320'>whereas friction is a surface effect.</span> </p><p><span
  m='605410'>And because the volume increases more quickly</span> <span
  m='608020'>with the size of the object then does the surface,</span> <span
  m='610610'>you might think that probably, there's</span> <span m='612730'>a
  bigger problem with friction at the nano scale</span> <span m='614780'>than
  there is for macroscopic objects.</span> </p><p><span m='617930'>To illustrate
  how bad this really is,</span> <span m='620170'>let's consider a tire of a
  car.</span> </p><p><span m='625490'>So this tire is rolling as your car is
  driving.</span> </p><p><span m='629830'>And we can try to estimate what
  happens</span> <span m='631990'>to the wear of this tire.</span> </p><p><span
  m='634970'>So let's say that this tire maybe wears off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='642100'>Wear is on the order of maybe, let's say,</span> <span
  m='646830'>10 millimeters every, maybe, 50,000 kilometers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='658870'>So that means we take off a number of atomic layers</span> <span
  m='662790'>here every 50,000 kilometers.</span> </p><p><span m='665640'>Now,
  how many atomic layers is 10 millimeter?</span> </p><p><span m='668510'>If we
  say that one atomic layer is</span> <span m='675140'>on the order of, let's
  call it 1 Angstrom-- which is 10</span> <span m='678330'>to the minus 10
  meters-- then 10 millimeters</span> <span m='684660'>is 10 to the minus 2
  meters.</span> </p><p><span m='688870'>So that is equal-- since one
  layer</span> <span m='691180'>is 10 to minus 10 meters-- that is equal to
  10</span> <span m='694280'>to the 8 atomic layers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='702270'>We can also ask ourself, how far has the tire been moving?</span>
  </p><p><span m='711260'>So if we assume that the circumference of the tire--
  so</span> <span m='716260'>this is the radius of the tire.</span> </p><p><span
  m='718480'>Let's guess that maybe the circumference of the tire here,</span>
  <span m='721010'>which is given by 2 pi r, is on the order of 1 meter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='726810'>Then this means that 50,000 kilometers-- or 5 times
  10</span> <span m='732000'>to the 7 meters, which is 50,000
  kilometers--</span> <span m='740300'>is basically 5 times 10 to the 7
  revolutions.</span> </p><p><span m='752970'>So in 50 million revolutions-- 5
  times 10 to the 7 revolutions--</span> <span m='757800'>we lose 10 to the 8
  atomic layers.</span> </p><p><span m='760690'>So it comes out that we lose one
  to two atomic layers</span> <span m='766760'>per revolution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='771880'>If we had used maybe a size of an atom</span> <span
  m='774180'>more closely as two Angstroms, we</span> <span m='775730'>would
  come out at about one atomic layer.</span> </p><p><span m='777930'>So this is
  a remarkable effect.</span> </p><p><span m='780100'>Even when we drive our
  car, each time the tire rolls around,</span> <span m='784160'>we leave one
  atomic layer on the street.</span> </p><p><span m='786289'>For a macroscopic
  object, as we see, it doesn't matter.</span> </p><p><span m='788580'>We can
  drive a very large macroscopic distance</span> <span m='791540'>before we wear
  off a few millimeters of the tire.</span> </p><p><span m='794330'>But if the
  tire of the car was itself</span> <span m='796930'>only a few atomic layers
  big, then you</span> <span m='799570'>see we would have a huge problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='802070'>So this is why people are interested in
  understanding,</span> <span m='804610'>and maybe manipulating, friction at the
  nano scale.</span> </p><p><span m='809140'>So what does friction at the nano
  scale really look like?</span> </p><p><span m='812360'>And why are people
  interested in it</span> <span m='814730'>after so many centuries of first
  studying friction?</span> </p><p><span m='820180'>One reason is that now one
  can do experiments</span> <span m='823410'>at the nano scale.</span>
  </p><p><span m='832540'>And the new tool that has enabled that</span> <span
  m='835190'>is what is called an atomic force microscope.</span> </p><p><span
  m='842670'>What is an atomic force microscope?</span> </p><p><span
  m='844520'>Well, it's essentially a very, very sharp tip--</span> <span
  m='847310'>atomically sharp tip.</span> </p><p><span m='848480'>So you have a
  surface here, which consists of atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='855590'>And
  these are individual atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='859830'>And you're trying
  to study the friction.</span> </p><p><span m='862040'>And now what you do is,
  you bring an object here shaped</span> <span m='866400'>in the form of the
  tip, which also consists of atoms.</span> </p><p><span m='869850'>And the
  object is so sharp that you have,</span> <span m='872500'>ideally, just one
  atom near the surface-- one</span> <span m='876690'>or more atoms near the
  surface.</span> </p><p><span m='879480'>So this is what an atomic force
  microscope is.</span> </p><p><span m='881960'>You can pull on this with some
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='885720'>And then you can try to measure the
  force of resistance--</span> <span m='888910'>the friction force that is due
  to the interaction</span> <span m='894810'>between the atom near the surface
  and the atoms</span> <span m='897940'>forming the surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m='899660'>So we might call this the substrate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='905060'>And this would be the moving object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='912240'>And we can either study static friction</span> <span m='914560'>by
  pulling the objects, but not with a force large enough</span> <span
  m='917760'>to move, or maybe we can apply a larger force</span> <span
  m='922060'>so the object starts moving at a certain velocity v,</span> <span
  m='924460'>and we can measure friction.</span> </p><p><span m='927330'>Now
  this, as simple as it may seem,</span> <span m='929020'>is still too
  complicated for physicists.</span> </p><p><span m='931430'>So we try to make
  the model even simpler.</span> </p><p><span m='934610'>So how do physicists do
  this?</span> </p><p><span m='939310'>Well, they say that the surface still
  consists of atoms,</span> <span m='944580'>but now we're mostly interested
  what happens to this tip.</span> </p><p><span m='947490'>We're going to say,
  well, somehow,</span> <span m='949450'>what matters is that this atom is bound
  to the tip.</span> </p><p><span m='952700'>So maybe we can model it in the
  following way.</span> </p><p><span m='956430'>We have here the macroscopic
  part of the tip.</span> </p><p><span m='960200'>And then we're going to say
  that the surface atom is really</span> <span m='963480'>bound in some way to
  the tip.</span> </p><p><span m='966570'>And the simplest way that we can
  imagine the surface atom</span> <span m='970060'>to be bound to the tip is via
  some spring</span> <span m='975070'>with some specific spring constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='977960'>So basically, the one atom that makes</span> <span
  m='980020'>the contact with the surface is bound via spring</span> <span
  m='984350'>to the rest of a tip that is moving--</span> <span m='986510'>to
  the rest of the moving object.</span> </p><p><span m='988480'>So this is how
  we view the tip as physicists, to make a model.</span> </p><p><span
  m='992374'>And then how do we view the surface to make a model?</span>
  </p><p><span m='994540'>Well, we say this is really a periodic
  arrangement</span> <span m='996770'>of the atoms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='997750'>So maybe it makes sense to kind of assume</span> <span
  m='1001240'>that the associated potential is also</span> <span
  m='1004740'>periodic at the atomic scale.</span> </p><p><span m='1007690'>So
  this is the potential as a function of position.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1011560'>So basically, we model friction as spring</span> <span
  m='1026760'>plus periodic potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1035108'>This is a
  very simple model.</span> </p><p><span m='1037400'>And it was first introduced
  now about 90 years ago.</span> </p><p><span m='1041550'>So by Prandtl-- by a
  German physicist</span> <span m='1048170'>called Prandtl-- and
  independently</span> <span m='1052400'>by another physicist called
  Tomlinson.</span> </p><p><span m='1055910'>And this is called the
  Prandtl-Tomlinson model.</span> </p><p><span m='1059070'>And they discovered
  it, or introduced it,</span> <span m='1062450'>in 1928 and 1929.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1066577'>And it turns out that this very simple model</span>
  <span m='1068410'>of a spring and the periodic potential</span> <span
  m='1070710'>captures much of the essence of nano friction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1075090'>So as physicists, now we have a spring</span> <span
  m='1076970'>and the periodic potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1078660'>How do
  we think about this?</span> </p><p><span m='1080430'>Well, one way is to think
  about the energy in the system.</span> </p><p><span m='1084900'>So we can plot
  the energy as a function of position.</span> </p><p><span m='1088900'>And now
  we have our periodic potential, like so.</span> </p><p><span m='1094720'>And
  how do we model the spring?</span> </p><p><span m='1096440'>Well, this is
  going to be the potential energy, v. How</span> <span m='1099150'>do we model
  the spring?</span> </p><p><span m='1100360'>Well, the spring has a linear
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='1103290'>The force is proportional to the
  displacement,</span> <span m='1105400'>which means the potential is quadratic
  in this placement.</span> </p><p><span m='1108500'>So this is the potential
  for spring.</span> </p><p><span m='1111510'>This is what the spring does, and
  this</span> <span m='1113200'>is what the substrate does.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1117130'>And what we need to do is, we need to add these two
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='1121160'>So what that means qualitatively
  is</span> <span m='1123780'>that the total potential of the system</span>
  <span m='1126040'>might look something like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1134740'>So as we now translate the spring</span> <span m='1137710'>across
  the surface with some velocity,</span> <span m='1143930'>then you can see that
  this addition</span> <span m='1146390'>between the fixed substrate potential--
  this one is fixed--</span> <span m='1151200'>and this spring potential is
  moving.</span> </p><p><span m='1154120'>You can see that this will lead to a
  time-varying potential</span> <span m='1157200'>for the object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1158520'>So let's look now, in a simulation, what that
  time</span> <span m='1161620'>variation might look like.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1166050'>So what you see here is a combination</span> <span m='1168600'>of
  a spring and the periodic potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1171192'>And the
  periodic potential has been</span> <span m='1172650'>chosen a slightly
  different strength</span> <span m='1174370'>than I'm showing you here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1175660'>It has been chosen weaker so that instead</span>
  <span m='1178670'>of many minima in this total potential,</span> <span
  m='1181340'>there are only two minima.</span> </p><p><span m='1182840'>And
  what you see happening in this system</span> <span m='1184610'>is that, as the
  particle is moving,</span> <span m='1187610'>the spring tries to pull it
  across a maximum</span> <span m='1191900'>of the periodic potential.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1193470'>At some point, the atom is released,</span> <span
  m='1195820'>and it releases energy that is taken up</span> <span
  m='1198860'>as heat by the substrate.</span> </p><p><span m='1201500'>And
  then, the object is pulled towards the next minimum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1205840'>The minimum disappears slowly.</span> </p><p><span m='1207810'>The
  object is released again, et cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='1209940'>So
  basically, in this model, we can understand friction</span> <span
  m='1212330'>as the external force pulling the object</span> <span
  m='1215140'>over successive maxima.</span> </p><p><span m='1218120'>So that's
  nice.</span> </p><p><span m='1219160'>In this model we can understand why
  there is heat generated.</span> </p><p><span m='1221930'>There's always heat
  generated when the atom loses</span> <span m='1225290'>this extra energy,
  because it is stuck</span> <span m='1227970'>for a while in a minimum of the
  potential, which</span> <span m='1231340'>is not the absolute minimum of the
  potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1233510'>And then the moment it's
  released,</span> <span m='1235130'>it releases kinetic energy that is
  converted into heat.</span> </p><p><span m='1238510'>Now we can have a
  different situation.</span> </p><p><span m='1242490'>So this was for strong or
  moderately strong potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1259150'>So basically,
  this was a situation</span> <span m='1261710'>where there are just two minima
  in the potential, like so.</span> </p><p><span m='1266780'>We can make the
  potential a little bit weaker.</span> </p><p><span m='1270380'>And in that
  case, the curvature of this potential--</span> <span m='1274700'>of the
  periodic potential-- the curvature in one direction</span> <span
  m='1278440'>might not be enough to overcome the opposite curvature</span>
  <span m='1281090'>of the spring.</span> </p><p><span m='1282050'>So in this
  case, we can end up with a potential just slightly</span> <span
  m='1284760'>distorted, but we have only one minimum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1293020'>So in the next movie, I will show you</span> <span
  m='1294730'>what happens when we have just one minimum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1297590'>In that case, you can see that, because there</span> <span
  m='1299730'>is no second minimum in the system, the object--</span> <span
  m='1304670'>in this case, the tip-- follows quite smoothly</span> <span
  m='1307170'>the minimum of the potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1308760'>And
  no energy is released.</span> </p><p><span m='1310420'>No heat is released in
  the problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1312630'>This model-- this
  Prandtl-Tomlinson model--</span> <span m='1314800'>is interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1315960'>If in this model, we plot the friction force</span>
  <span m='1322220'>versus the corrugation of the potential corrugation--</span>
  <span m='1329790'>so we'll call this the corrugation of the potential,</span>
  <span m='1332440'>u, which is proportional to the normal force</span> <span
  m='1337180'>for a macroscopic object-- then what we find is,</span> <span
  m='1340950'>yes, we find a linear dependence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1343020'>So this is, if you want, the corrugation</span> <span
  m='1345360'>or the normal force.</span> </p><p><span m='1347560'>What we find
  is a linear dependence, but only</span> <span m='1350280'>above a certain
  critical value.</span> </p><p><span m='1352890'>So the friction force actually
  looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1358350'>It's 0 until the potential
  becomes strong enough.</span> </p><p><span m='1361760'>Basically, you can
  think of this curvature becoming larger</span> <span m='1364490'>than that
  curvature.</span> </p><p><span m='1366070'>And then, the friction force sets
  in.</span> </p><p><span m='1368830'>So this is at the nano scale.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1372960'>And our simple macroscopic friction law</span> <span
  m='1376180'>would have predicted something of the same slope</span> <span
  m='1381190'>at the macro scale-- something of the same slope</span> <span
  m='1384170'>with a [INAUDIBLE] offset.</span> </p><p><span m='1385880'>So we
  can kind of see that, at the nano scale,</span> <span m='1388244'>the friction
  is a little bit more complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='1390160'>There's a
  region where there's no friction whatsoever.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1392770'>But then it increases linearly with the normal force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1395530'>So you can imagine that if I go to macroscopic normal
  loads,</span> <span m='1399250'>then the difference between these curves, at
  least</span> <span m='1401840'>fractionally, will be quite small.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1405376'>The difference between these curves, at least
  fractionally,</span> <span m='1407880'>will be quite small.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1409170'>And so we can see how the law of the nano
  scale,</span> <span m='1413340'>explained by this very simple
  Prandtl-Tomlinson model,</span> <span m='1416320'>approaches the law at the
  macro scale.</span> </p><p><span m='1418570'>So far, I have told you about
  something very simple--</span> <span m='1421730'>namely when the contact is a
  single atom.</span> </p><p><span m='1430310'>And even making this very simple
  approximation,</span> <span m='1432550'>we can already understand why the
  friction</span> <span m='1435190'>force is approximately proportional</span>
  <span m='1437930'>to the normal force.</span> </p><p><span m='1439890'>Now in
  real life, probably there is more than one atom</span> <span
  m='1443420'>touching the surface.</span> </p><p><span m='1445010'>So let's
  consider a contact area where several atoms-- maybe</span> <span m='1455740'>a
  long chain, maybe just a few atoms, in the case of nanoscale</span> <span
  m='1458950'>probably just a few atoms-- several atoms will be making up</span>
  <span m='1462110'>the contact.</span> </p><p><span m='1463370'>So instead of
  considering this situation</span> <span m='1467350'>with one atom on a spring,
  which is the single atom case,</span> <span m='1473140'>now let's consider a
  situation where several atoms make up</span> <span m='1478340'>the
  contact.</span> </p><p><span m='1479810'>So again, here we have the
  substrate</span> <span m='1483300'>with our periodic potential that is
  ultimately coming</span> <span m='1486430'>from the individual atoms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1488050'>But now we will consider more than one atom making
  up</span> <span m='1493946'>the surface.</span> </p><p><span m='1498710'>So in
  this case, how do we model the system?</span> </p><p><span m='1505010'>Well,
  we think that these atoms are still connected by springs</span> <span
  m='1508670'>to the macroscopic object.</span> </p><p><span m='1512630'>But
  typically, these atoms will also have forces between them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1517280'>So this is my physicist's model of what</span> <span
  m='1520330'>happens when more than one atom touches the surface.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1523530'>Now these are only masses of springs</span> <span
  m='1525690'>and some simple periodic potential,</span> <span m='1527530'>and
  yet the situation is quite complex, and in many ways,</span> <span
  m='1530880'>counter-intuitive.</span> </p><p><span m='1532690'>And the first
  thing that changes compared to the single atom</span> <span m='1536440'>is
  that now I have the distance between the atoms</span> <span m='1539780'>as a
  parameter.</span> </p><p><span m='1541140'>So if I label the period of the
  periodic potential</span> <span m='1546370'>as a, and maybe the period of my
  object of the distance</span> <span m='1553470'>between the atoms in the
  object as d,</span> <span m='1556816'>then I can have different
  situations.</span> </p><p><span m='1559730'>So one very simple case is when
  d</span> <span m='1567520'>is equal to a-- when the two periods are the
  same--</span> <span m='1570360'>or in general, when d is a multiple integer of
  a,</span> <span m='1574630'>and n is an integer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1580000'>So let's see what happens in this case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1582280'>Very naively, all the atoms are doing the same thing</span> <span
  m='1585390'>relative to the surface.</span> </p><p><span m='1587090'>So you
  might expect them, maybe, to move</span> <span m='1589150'>in exactly the same
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='1590710'>They will all move together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1592200'>And these springs between them will not
  stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='1595220'>In this case, I can forget about the
  springs</span> <span m='1598020'>between the atoms in this simple case</span>
  <span m='1601880'>that we'll call commensurate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1605190'>Basically, when the period of the object</span> <span
  m='1609710'>matches the period of the substrate--</span> <span m='1611440'>the
  commensurate case-- then the atoms are</span> <span m='1617770'>at equivalent
  positions throughout the substrate</span> <span m='1619870'>period, the
  lattice of the springs between them</span> <span m='1622560'>will not
  stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='1624270'>And it's as if they are not
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='1627730'>So in the commensurate case,
  what</span> <span m='1629300'>you can see here is, as the atoms are
  pulled</span> <span m='1631920'>across the periodic potential, because</span>
  <span m='1634620'>of this commensurability condition where d is equal to
  a</span> <span m='1637750'>or a multiple integer of a-- basically,</span>
  <span m='1639570'>two periods are matched-- all the atoms</span> <span
  m='1641830'>are doing the same thing at the same time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1643580'>So they get pulled, pulled, pulled.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1645440'>They first stick, and then they all slip at the same time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1650960'>And you can imagine-- and you can kind of see
  visually</span> <span m='1653380'>in this case-- that the friction is</span>
  <span m='1656310'>the same as the single atom friction multiplied
  simply</span> <span m='1659940'>by n.</span> </p><p><span m='1660890'>So this
  is just the single atom friction</span> <span m='1663070'>that we have seen
  before multiplied</span> <span m='1665560'>by just the number of atoms that
  makes up the contact area.</span> </p><p><span m='1669640'>Now there's a
  different case, which</span> <span m='1674080'>we might call incommensurate,
  where d is not equal to a,</span> <span m='1684960'>and d is not an integer
  multiple of a.</span> </p><p><span m='1687900'>So maybe d could be 1.5 a, or
  2/3 of a, or some other number.</span> </p><p><span m='1693380'>And what is
  the most incommensurate case</span> <span m='1695310'>that we can
  imagine?</span> </p><p><span m='1696630'>Well, the most incommensurate case
  for d and a</span> <span m='1702070'>is that the ratio of d and a is an
  irrational number.</span> </p><p><span m='1711190'>So an irrational number
  would be something</span> <span m='1712940'>like square root of 2, or for our
  purposes,</span> <span m='1717510'>it turns out that the most irrational
  number</span> <span m='1719930'>in a mathematical sense is 1/2 squared of 5
  plus 1.</span> </p><p><span m='1726030'>This is the so-called Golden
  Ratio.</span> </p><p><span m='1730860'>The ancient Greeks believed that it had
  magical properties.</span> </p><p><span m='1734530'>For instance, when they
  built the temples, the two</span> <span m='1737670'>sides of the temples-- the
  two sides of the rectangle--</span> <span m='1740710'>were related by this
  very strange number,</span> <span m='1743830'>the so-called Golden
  Ratio.</span> </p><p><span m='1745430'>It is assumed to be aesthetically very
  pleasing.</span> </p><p><span m='1748956'>Now mathematically speaking, the
  Golden Ratio</span> <span m='1750830'>is very interesting, because it is the
  most irrational number,</span> <span m='1755750'>in some sense, that you can
  devise.</span> </p><p><span m='1760560'>Now we can choose such an
  incommensurate ratio</span> <span m='1763770'>of d over a, and see what
  happens in this case.</span> </p><p><span m='1767850'>So you can see here
  that, in the case</span> <span m='1770640'>of an incommensurate ratio, the
  behavior of the transport--</span> <span m='1774480'>the behavior of the
  motion of the object--</span> <span m='1776230'>changes dramatically.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1777710'>Instead of all the atoms sticking and slipping
  together,</span> <span m='1780320'>like we had in the commensurate
  case,</span> <span m='1782570'>now the atoms move one by one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1785040'>Basically, the first atom moves over the barrier, the
  spring</span> <span m='1788180'>stretches, which facilitates the motion</span>
  <span m='1793500'>of the next atom over the barrier, the next atom,</span>
  <span m='1796020'>and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='1796960'>So these atom
  chains move like a caterpillar.</span> </p><p><span m='1800590'>They
  essentially move one by one.</span> </p><p><span m='1802390'>In technical
  language, we call these things kinks.</span> </p><p><span m='1805011'>You can
  see that they are periodic compressions.</span> </p><p><span m='1807010'>They
  are compressions in the chain</span> <span m='1809140'>and stretches in the
  chain.</span> </p><p><span m='1810840'>And so these atoms move like a
  caterpillar.</span> </p><p><span m='1813700'>And now an interesting fact is
  that in this case,</span> <span m='1817370'>friction is dramatically
  reduced.</span> </p><p><span m='1829300'>And depending on which regime you
  are,</span> <span m='1831640'>the friction can even disappear altogether at
  the nano scale.</span> </p><p><span m='1837040'>The reduction was so large
  that some people have even</span> <span m='1841680'>coined this with the word
  superlubricity.</span> </p><p><span m='1848610'>Interestingly enough, even
  though this is a very simple</span> <span m='1851440'>system, it's just, if
  you want, balls and springs,</span> <span m='1855570'>this superlubricity was
  only discovered in the late 1980s,</span> <span m='1860760'>even though we
  know all the physics</span> <span m='1863130'>for more than a century.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1865170'>So you can see just a tiny, tiny rearrangement of the
  atoms--</span> <span m='1868580'>not to be any more commensurate with the
  lattice,</span> <span m='1871010'>but to be incommensurate in terms</span>
  <span m='1873810'>of an irrational number-- can change friction</span> <span
  m='1876180'>properties dramatically.</span> </p><p><span m='1879560'>In fact,
  there was a French scientist</span> <span m='1881900'>called Aubry that first
  pointed out</span> <span m='1884900'>that there's a very interesting
  transition that happens</span> <span m='1887690'>in this system of a periodic
  potential</span> <span m='1890000'>and atoms connected with springs when you
  choose, as the ratio</span> <span m='1894160'>between these two length scales,
  the Golden Ratio.</span> </p><p><span m='1898470'>And this is called the Aubry
  Transition.</span> </p><p><span m='1902900'>So far, we have considered only,
  if you</span> <span m='1908100'>want, the mechanics of the motion,
  which</span> <span m='1911830'>is equivalent to saying that we have assumed
  that the system is</span> <span m='1914710'>at temperature T equal 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1921190'>Basically, the atoms remains at the minimum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1924430'>It doesn't wiggle around because of
  temperature,</span> <span m='1927610'>and we have derived the friction in this
  limit.</span> </p><p><span m='1930910'>Now what happens for finite
  temperature--</span> <span m='1938830'>by finite, meaning a temperature that
  is larger than 0.</span> </p><p><span m='1942550'>Well, if you think back of
  our simple single-atom model</span> <span m='1945970'>of friction, where maybe
  an atom is stuck here</span> <span m='1948980'>as the potential is moving with
  some velocity v,</span> <span m='1951940'>then in the 0 temperature limit,
  this atom</span> <span m='1954550'>would only be released at the time when
  this minimum actually</span> <span m='1960420'>disappears.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1961220'>And then it would have a high energy</span> <span m='1963740'>and
  it would dissipate this energy</span> <span m='1966530'>to be cooled to the
  next minimum.</span> </p><p><span m='1968530'>However, if we have a finite
  temperature T--</span> <span m='1971220'>some temperature scale T-- that
  means</span> <span m='1973520'>that the energy of the atom in the potential is
  not 0,</span> <span m='1977810'>the kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1979050'>But the atom has a smeared-out kinetic energy</span> <span
  m='1982200'>and potential energy that is like so.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1986050'>So what that means is that the atom can [INAUDIBLE] hop
  over</span> <span m='1989460'>the barrier and find the new minimum, without
  actually</span> <span m='1992820'>having to be pulled over this
  maximum.</span> </p><p><span m='1995820'>So what we expect is that temperature
  effect</span> <span m='1999230'>might reduce friction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2002540'>So people call this thermolubricity-- the effect</span> <span
  m='2010222'>that when you heat up the surface--</span> <span m='2011680'>and
  in many instances, you would have to substantially heat up</span> <span
  m='2014263'>the surface-- then friction is reduced,</span> <span
  m='2016720'>because the atom can find the new minimum of the potential</span>
  <span m='2019730'>without actually having to be pulled over the
  barrier.</span> </p><p><span m='2023070'>So let's see in a small simulation
  what</span> <span m='2024990'>that might look like.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2026389'>What you see here is now that the atom</span> <span
  m='2029070'>has a chance of hopping between the two minima, back and
  forth.</span> </p><p><span m='2033047'>And it has a certain probability to
  be</span> <span m='2034630'>found at either one of the two minima,</span>
  <span m='2036580'>which is indicated by the size of the red circle,</span>
  <span m='2039840'>in this case.</span> </p><p><span m='2040860'>So you can see
  that when temperature is present,</span> <span m='2043580'>then the atom can
  follow the minimum locally--</span> <span m='2046720'>the absolute global
  minimum-- simply because it</span> <span m='2048770'>can hop back and forth
  between the barrier</span> <span m='2051050'>without actually experiencing
  much friction.</span> </p><p><span m='2055340'>So in particular in the limit
  when the temperature is very,</span> <span m='2058270'>very high, or the
  velocity of the atom</span> <span m='2060370'>is very, very low, then the atom
  with hop many times back</span> <span m='2064310'>and forth between the two
  minima.</span> </p><p><span m='2066010'>And the distribution between the two
  minima</span> <span m='2068500'>would be simply given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann
  distribution,</span> <span m='2071739'>which means that the atom will be
  predominantly found</span> <span m='2074790'>in the global minimum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2075969'>And they'll just be following the potential
  along</span> <span m='2078360'>and the friction in this system will be quite
  small.</span> </p><p><span m='2086199'>So in this case, if we do a measurement
  of friction</span> <span m='2091340'>versus velocity in a simulator-- that we
  do,</span> <span m='2096010'>then this is what the result might look
  like,</span> <span m='2099020'>or what the result does look like.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2101220'>We see here different ranges of friction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2103390'>We see a range where the friction does not</span>
  <span m='2106350'>depend on velocity at all.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2109360'>Friction is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='2110540'>Then there's a
  range where the friction increases</span> <span m='2112880'>with velocity, but
  only very weakly logarithmically.</span> </p><p><span m='2115490'>Please
  notice that this is a logarithmic scale</span> <span m='2118790'>for the
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='2120190'>So the velocity here changes over
  five orders of magnitude.</span> </p><p><span m='2125170'>So friction
  increases with increasing velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='2128280'>Then
  there's a range of frictions</span> <span m='2130110'>actually independent of
  velocity,</span> <span m='2132090'>just like the simple macroscopic law would
  predict.</span> </p><p><span m='2135320'>And then it turns out when you move
  the atom very, very fast,</span> <span m='2138062'>then it basically doesn't
  have time</span> <span m='2139520'>to dissipate all the energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2141090'>And friction is reduced again, effectively,</span>
  <span m='2143020'>because the atom is hotter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2144690'>So we can see that the simple macroscopic law of friction</span>
  <span m='2149620'>only applies in a region, which in this experiment</span>
  <span m='2152770'>was relatively narrow, of relatively low
  temperatures.</span> </p><p><span m='2158210'>So let's summarize what happens
  to the loss at the macro scale.</span> </p><p><span m='2166230'>So the first
  law at the macro scale</span> <span m='2167910'>was that the friction force
  was proportional</span> <span m='2173740'>to the normal force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2175750'>And we found that at the nano scale, actually what
  happens</span> <span m='2179730'>is a displaced curve, where there</span>
  <span m='2182760'>is no friction in a certain region,</span> <span
  m='2184380'>and then the friction follows parallel to the macro
  results.</span> </p><p><span m='2189080'>So this would be the actual friction
  at the nano scale.</span> </p><p><span m='2191690'>And we see that it's a
  fairly good approximation</span> <span m='2195090'>to the macroscopic
  friction, but with a small offset.</span> </p><p><span m='2198330'>Our second
  law of friction was that friction</span> <span m='2204440'>is independent of
  surface area, of contact area--</span> <span m='2217060'>basically, the idea
  that a high object</span> <span m='2221420'>and a flat object of the same
  mass</span> <span m='2223210'>experience the same friction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2224830'>And we see that at the nano scale,</span> <span
  m='2228360'>it's replaced by a much more complicated law that</span> <span
  m='2232730'>depends on the arrangement of the atoms, or on, if you
  want,</span> <span m='2238162'>commensurability.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2244590'>so we have non-equivalent arrangements</span> <span m='2246330'>of
  the atoms that can either lead</span> <span m='2248090'>to large or small
  friction.</span> </p><p><span m='2249830'>And somehow, the macroscopic law is
  some kind</span> <span m='2252410'>of average over these behaviors, if we
  allow for randomness</span> <span m='2256340'>in the positions of the
  surfaces.</span> </p><p><span m='2258370'>And finally, our third law-- that at
  the macroscopic scale,</span> <span m='2263990'>friction is independent of
  velocity--</span> <span m='2274400'>we found at the nano scale that this can
  be true,</span> <span m='2283370'>but it is generally true only in some finite
  temperature range--</span> <span m='2299730'>namely, that if you move the
  object very, very slowly,</span> <span m='2303910'>then thermal excitations
  allow you to always find</span> <span m='2307910'>the global minimum, and
  friction disappears-- the effect</span> <span m='2311790'>called
  thermolubricity.</span> </p><p><span m='2314610'>So one can see that there are
  nice connections</span> <span m='2319580'>between the nano scale and the macro
  scale.</span> </p><p><span m='2321570'>But many open questions remain, in
  particular,</span> <span m='2324630'>concerning the point two, which is</span>
  <span m='2328030'>that the friction is independent of the contact area.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2330670'>What does the contact area really</span> <span
  m='2332120'>look like for two macroscopic objects?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2336090'>And how is it that this independence on the surface</span> <span
  m='2340490'>area-- or at least on the apparent contact area--</span> <span
  m='2343540'>actually arises from the properties of friction</span> <span
  m='2346160'>at the nano scale?</span> </p>
