  <p><span m='1470'>Last week, we discussed the kinematics of motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5170'>How one describes the motion of an object</span> <span
  m='7470'>by specifying its position, velocity, and acceleration</span> <span
  m='11500'>as a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='13600'>This week, we
  will continue by discussing</span> <span m='16140'>the dynamics of
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='17810'>How the application of forces on an
  object</span> <span m='20540'>changes the geometry or trajectory of its
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='24170'>We will see that the applied forces and
  the change</span> <span m='27220'>in trajectory are related through Newton's
  laws</span> <span m='30050'>of motion.</span> </p><p><span m='31330'>We will
  begin by reviewing Newton's three laws of motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='35110'>These were a landmark achievement</span> <span m='36970'>in
  scientific thought.</span> </p><p><span m='38820'>Most people who haven't
  studied physics</span> <span m='41180'>tend to intuitively think in terms of
  the ancient mechanics</span> <span m='44180'>of Aristotle in which an applied
  force is required to maintain</span> <span m='48460'>a body in uniform
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='50850'>Superficially, this seems to
  agree</span> <span m='52850'>with our everyday experience, but only</span>
  <span m='54960'>because friction plays such an important role</span> <span
  m='57280'>in our everyday life.</span> </p><p><span m='58830'>One of Newton's
  great insights was</span> <span m='61520'>that applied forces cause changes in
  an object's motion,</span> <span m='65129'>rather than being necessary to
  maintain uniform motion.</span> </p><p><span m='69170'>Newton's laws were the
  end result</span> <span m='71260'>of a great deal of careful
  definition,</span> <span m='73800'>observation, and reasoning by many
  scientists</span> <span m='76700'>up to and including Newton.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78560'>It is a fascinating and compelling chapter</span> <span
  m='80680'>in the history of science, but we will not discuss</span> <span
  m='82940'>that history in this course.</span> </p><p><span m='84750'>Instead,
  we will simply state Newton's three laws of motion</span> <span m='88150'>as
  assumed postulates or axioms and discuss their meaning</span> <span
  m='91720'>and application.</span> </p><p><span m='93479'>Finally, we will
  consider several specific examples</span> <span m='96729'>of physical forces,
  such as gravity, contact forces exerted</span> <span m='101450'>by a solid
  surface, like the so-called normal force, which</span> <span m='104710'>acts
  perpendicular or normal to the surface,</span> <span m='107690'>and friction,
  which acts parallel to the surface,</span> <span m='111200'>pulling forces
  like tension in a rope or chain,</span> <span m='114539'>and the force exerted
  by a stretched or compressed spring</span> <span m='117560'>described by
  Hooke's law.</span> </p><p><span m='119979'>Taken as a whole, this week will
  show us</span> <span m='122490'>how to connect the two sides of Newton's
  Second Law of Motion,</span> <span m='125870'>f equals ma, the dynamics or
  application</span> <span m='128919'>of forces on the left-hand side and its
  relation</span> <span m='131550'>to the kinematics, the change in geometry of
  the object's motion</span> <span m='134860'>or trajectory, on the right-hand
  side.</span> </p><p></p>
