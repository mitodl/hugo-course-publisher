title: 6.1 Contact Forces
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3700'>Let's consider what happens when we have an object
  that's</span> <span m='6450'>moving on a horizontal surface.</span>
  </p><p><span m='8930'>So here's our object, and here's our surface.</span>
  </p><p><span m='12060'>Now, we want to look at a special case</span> <span
  m='14020'>where we're applying a force F to the object,</span> <span
  m='18330'>and the object is moving at a constant speed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='24170'>Then what we see here is that there</span> <span m='26090'>has to be
  some type of force that's</span> <span m='28520'>opposing this object, the
  interaction between the object</span> <span m='31860'>and the surface, that's
  distributed over the surface.</span> </p><p><span m='35830'>For this, I'll
  write an arrow here to express that force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='40190'>That's the tangential component of the force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='42590'>The object is also pressing down on the surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m='44910'>The surface is pressing up on the object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='47040'>And so there's another perpendicular force</span> <span m='49500'>to
  the surface, which is referred</span> <span m='51280'>to as the normal
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='53560'>And the total vector sum of these two
  forces--</span> <span m='57320'>the perpendicular part, the normal
  force,</span> <span m='59920'>and the tangential part-- is referred to</span>
  <span m='62980'>as the contact force.</span> </p><p><span m='64470'>This is
  what we'll call kinetic friction.</span> </p><p><span m='69970'>Now, when the
  object is moving at a constant speed,</span> <span m='74410'>we know that,
  from experiment, that the kinetic friction,</span> <span m='78260'>the
  magnitude, is proportional to the magnitude</span> <span m='83140'>of the
  normal force.</span> </p><p><span m='84789'>And the constant of
  proportionality</span> <span m='86850'>is called the coefficient of kinetic
  friction.</span> </p><p><span m='90630'>Now, this law is telling us something
  very interesting,</span> <span m='95009'>that key properties are, one, that
  it's</span> <span m='98840'>independent of the contact area.</span>
  </p><p><span m='103430'>Now, what do we mean by that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='106100'>So let's look at the following picture.</span> </p><p><span
  m='108590'>Suppose we have two objects of the same mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='113009'>On the surface, we're applying a force F and the contact
  area</span> <span m='119300'>here, A1.</span> </p><p><span m='121780'>And we
  have a similar object, the same mass,</span> <span m='125970'>on the same
  surface.</span> </p><p><span m='128038'>And both objects are moving at a
  constant speed.</span> </p><p><span m='133810'>Now, these objects have
  different areas</span> <span m='136100'>of contact, A1 and A2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='138230'>But the force necessary to move the object</span>
  <span m='141380'>at the constant speed is the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='144550'>And because of that, the kinetic friction is the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m='150170'>And that indicates that it's independent of the
  contact</span> <span m='153090'>area.</span> </p><p><span m='154350'>And the
  other key property here, which we'll write over here,</span> <span
  m='159290'>is that it's independent of the speed of the object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='165240'>So we'll write that as independent of the
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='169090'>And these three properties of kinetic
  friction</span> <span m='172240'>are crucial for understanding the motion of
  objects</span> <span m='175570'>across a surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m='176720'>But we still don't have a very good theoretical model</span> <span
  m='182530'>for explaining this, although today, there</span> <span
  m='185760'>is a lot of contemporary research</span> <span m='187250'>which has
  made a lot of progress in understanding</span> <span m='190390'>this
  interaction.</span> </p><p></p>
