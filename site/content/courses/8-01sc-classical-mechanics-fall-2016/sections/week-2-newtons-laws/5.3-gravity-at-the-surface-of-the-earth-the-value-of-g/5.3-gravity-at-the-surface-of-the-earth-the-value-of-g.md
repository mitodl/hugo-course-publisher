  <p><span m='3300'>Let's consider the universal gravitational law a little
  bit</span> <span m='6420'>more.</span> </p><p><span m='8950'>Let's consider
  two objects in space.</span> </p><p><span m='11340'>Let's say this is the sun,
  and we have the earth here</span> <span m='15120'>or the earth and the
  moon.</span> </p><p><span m='17430'>And of course, they're orbiting each
  other.</span> </p><p><span m='19590'>So we can pick a coordinate system that
  goes radially.</span> </p><p><span m='23430'>And so we're going to have an r
  hat direction here,</span> <span m='26485'>and we're going to call this the r
  hat direction between objects</span> <span m='30400'>1 and 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='33570'>What forces are acting on this little moon here?</span>
  </p><p><span m='36370'>Well, it's the gravitational force going inward.</span>
  </p><p><span m='40520'>It's force of 1, 2, F1 2, on object 2,</span> <span
  m='44750'>due to the interaction between bodies 1 and 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='48590'>For that, we can write down the universal gravitational law,</span>
  <span m='52620'>F1 2 equals minus G, the gravitational constant, m1,</span>
  <span m='61060'>m2 of r1 2 squared.</span> </p><p><span m='65280'>That one is
  the distance between the two objects times r1 2 hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='72190'>And the minus goes, actually, with the unit vector</span> <span
  m='74660'>here, because the force goes in the opposite direction</span> <span
  m='77440'>from our r hat.</span> </p><p><span m='80270'>Let's now consider
  here is the earth again.</span> </p><p><span m='83789'>And we're going to move
  the moon or a little moon rock right</span> <span m='88200'>to the surface of
  the earth.</span> </p><p><span m='89780'>And we want to now calculate and
  consider what kind of force</span> <span m='93800'>this act on this moon rock,
  and what</span> <span m='96259'>is the gravitational acceleration that this
  moon</span> <span m='98820'>rock on the surface of the earth is
  experiencing?</span> </p><p><span m='101850'>So we have the earth.</span>
  </p><p><span m='104110'>Earth has one earth radius, and it has an earth
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='108680'>And our moon rock has the mass m.</span>
  </p><p><span m='113880'>And we know, from this exercise here already, that, of
  course,</span> <span m='118090'>this gravitational force is acting on our moon
  rock</span> <span m='121620'>as well.</span> </p><p><span m='122990'>That
  hasn't changed.</span> </p><p><span m='124510'>What we are now considering in
  addition</span> <span m='126610'>is that this moon rock is also
  experiencing</span> <span m='129038'>a gravitational acceleration due to this
  force,</span> <span m='132300'>and that goes inward as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='133960'>So it is experiencing an mg.</span> </p><p><span
  m='138090'>And we know that that is the same as the magnitude</span> <span
  m='143360'>of this force here.</span> </p><p><span m='145520'>So we can equate
  that with G, and then we have the earth mass</span> <span m='151920'>and the
  mass of the moon rock times the distance squared,</span> <span m='156440'>so
  an earth radius squared.</span> </p><p><span m='160220'>And from that, we
  already see that a, we</span> <span m='163840'>can cancel out the small m, so
  the moon rock,</span> <span m='167500'>and we get to g here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='169170'>So we can calculate the gravitational
  acceleration,</span> <span m='173360'>which is capital G earth mass over earth
  radius squared.</span> </p><p><span m='180820'>So if we have this kind of
  information,</span> <span m='183150'>we can determine the gravitational
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='185840'>And of course, it will change,
  depending on which</span> <span m='188690'>object we are considering.</span>
  </p><p><span m='190800'>It would be different if we plug in the solar
  mass</span> <span m='194120'>and the solar radius or the moon mass and the
  moon radius,</span> <span m='197350'>if we consider an astronaut standing
  here</span> <span m='200760'>on the moon's surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m='203980'>Now let's put some numbers into this equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='208079'>So we have g is capital G. That's</span> <span m='213470'>the
  gravitational constant.</span> </p><p><span m='214860'>We have 6.67, 10 to 11,
  and then we have Newton and 1</span> <span m='223210'>over kilogram squared
  and mass squared times</span> <span m='229980'>the earth mass, 5.97 10 to 24
  kilograms.</span> </p><p><span m='237650'>And then we have to divide this
  over</span> <span m='241150'>through the earth radius, 6.37 10 to the
  6.</span> </p><p><span m='247730'>And we have to square that, and we have to
  square the meters.</span> </p><p><span m='254960'>If we calculate this, we get
  to 9.81 meter per second squared.</span> </p><p><span m='261959'>And surely
  you have seen this number before.</span> </p><p><span m='265580'>This number
  can either be calculated,</span> <span m='267180'>if you know capital G, the
  gravitational constant,</span> <span m='270490'>or you can determine that
  gravitational acceleration</span> <span m='273930'>through an
  experiment.</span> </p><p><span m='275670'>And together with the earth mass
  and the earth radius,</span> <span m='278710'>you can actually calculate the
  gravitational constant there.</span> </p><p></p>
