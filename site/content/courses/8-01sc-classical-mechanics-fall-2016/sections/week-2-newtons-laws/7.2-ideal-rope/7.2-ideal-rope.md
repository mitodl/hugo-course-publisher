transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3510'>Today, we'd like to discuss tension in a rope.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6080'>Under what conditions is the tension uniform?</span>
  </p><p><span m='8850'>Recall that if we had a rope and say we were pulling--
  here's</span> <span m='14170'>our one end.</span> </p><p><span m='15170'>We'll
  call that we're pulling at this end with the force a.</span> </p><p><span
  m='18570'>And we pull on this end b with a force b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='23770'>Then what we meant by tension at any point in the rope</span> <span
  m='27100'>was that we took an imaginary slice of the rope p</span> <span
  m='31350'>and we looked at the two sides.</span> </p><p><span m='34120'>And
  here-- if we call this the left side and this is</span> <span m='37460'>the
  right side-- then on the left side,</span> <span m='41320'>we have that the
  right side of the rope</span> <span m='43970'>is pulling the left side of the
  rope by some force f.</span> </p><p><span m='49190'>And this is the left
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='51590'>And the right side is being pulled by the
  left side.</span> </p><p><span m='57000'>So that's the right side being pulled
  by the left.</span> </p><p><span m='60450'>And what we define the tension at
  the point p</span> <span m='63990'>was to be the magnitude of this
  action-reaction pair.</span> </p><p><span m='69840'>And that's how we define
  tension at a point inside a rope.</span> </p><p><span m='75100'>Now we'd like
  to address the question, under what conditions</span> <span m='79680'>can we
  say that the tension is uniform?</span> </p><p><span m='82830'>Which means
  that at all points p, the tension is the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='86250'>In order to analyze this, we'll apply Newton's second law.</span>
  </p><p><span m='89430'>So let's begin with the same situation as
  before.</span> </p><p><span m='92640'>Let's consider a rope where we're
  pulling this side</span> <span m='96690'>with a force at the end.</span>
  </p><p><span m='97880'>By the way, we can call the tension at that end T of
  a.</span> </p><p><span m='103755'>And on this side, we can refer to
  this</span> <span m='106900'>as the tension on side b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='110900'>Now suppose that our mass of the rope is non-zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='117870'>And we now want to apply Newton's second law.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120920'>But let's also apply the condition</span> <span
  m='123450'>that the acceleration of the rope is non-zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='126500'>So you're holding the rope under some tension</span> <span
  m='129889'>by pulling both sides.</span> </p><p><span m='131700'>But the rope
  is not accelerating.</span> </p><p><span m='134720'>And so what does that mean
  when we apply Newton's</span> <span m='137600'>second law to the rope?</span>
  </p><p><span m='140130'>Well, let's just arbitrarily call that</span> <span
  m='142800'>our positive direction.</span> </p><p><span m='144350'>We see by
  vector decomposition that we have Tb minus Ta</span> <span m='149370'>equals
  mass of the rope.</span> </p><p><span m='151210'>But because the acceleration
  of the rope is zero,</span> <span m='155180'>this side is zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='156930'>And we can use Newton's second law</span> <span
  m='159820'>to conclude that the tension in the rope</span> <span m='162910'>is
  uniform when the rope is not accelerating.</span> </p><p><span m='166180'>And
  this is what we'll call our case one.</span> </p><p><span m='170030'>A zero
  tension in the rope is uniform.</span> </p><p><span m='174079'>Now let's
  suppose case two, that a is not zero.</span> </p><p><span m='181080'>And so
  now we have the rope.</span> </p><p><span m='187510'>This is point b.</span>
  </p><p><span m='189900'>Here's point a.</span> </p><p><span m='192250'>We'll
  choose a uniform direction a.</span> </p><p><span m='194213'>And now we can
  see when we apply F equals</span> <span m='198890'>Ma, that Tb minus Ta equals
  mass of the rope</span> <span m='205480'>times the acceleration of the
  rope.</span> </p><p><span m='207710'>So you're pulling such that Tb is
  greater</span> <span m='212960'>than Ta by precisely the quantity Mr times
  a.</span> </p><p><span m='218160'>So the tension at the ends are not the
  same.</span> </p><p><span m='221160'>And therefore, the tension in the rope is
  not uniform.</span> </p><p><span m='224120'>Now there's a special case here
  that we want to consider.</span> </p><p><span m='228960'>So even though a is
  nonzero, let's</span> <span m='231990'>assume that the mass of the rope is
  very small.</span> </p><p><span m='236510'>And this is often-- people call
  this</span> <span m='238670'>assume the rope is massless.</span> </p><p><span
  m='240851'>Well, that's a little strange.</span> </p><p><span m='242370'>We
  can say that the very, very light string is often</span> <span m='246870'>the
  same type of modeling.</span> </p><p><span m='248590'>And under those
  circumstances with that assumption,</span> <span m='252500'>you see that there
  is no contribution here.</span> </p><p><span m='254990'>And with that
  assumption, that the tension</span> <span m='258060'>is approximately
  uniform.</span> </p><p><span m='261829'>Ropes are not massless.</span>
  </p><p><span m='263210'>There's a small difference.</span> </p><p><span
  m='264790'>But under those circumstances when we say a very light rope</span>
  <span m='270980'>that-- even if it is accelerating-- implies</span> <span
  m='273680'>that T is uniform in the rope.</span> </p><p><span m='280610'>And
  we can say the rope is under uniform tension.</span> </p><p><span
  m='283810'>And we will often refer to this case</span> <span m='287790'>when
  we analyze problems where we're</span> <span m='289430'>pulling objects, for
  instance, in a typical pulley problem.</span> </p>
