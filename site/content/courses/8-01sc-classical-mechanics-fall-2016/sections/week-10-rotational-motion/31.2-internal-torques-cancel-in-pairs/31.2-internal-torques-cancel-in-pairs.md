  <p><span m='3410'>We'd like to consider torques on a body.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5750'>Let's draw an arbitrary body, and let's consider a point s,</span>
  <span m='10930'>that we're about to calculate the torque.</span> </p><p><span
  m='13050'>Now, we know that forces on the body</span> <span m='14750'>can be
  both internal and external.</span> </p><p><span m='17180'>And we'd like to
  show that all internal torques will</span> <span m='19700'>cancel in
  pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='21140'>The way we'll do that is, suppose we pick
  an object.</span> </p><p><span m='25920'>We'll label it with mass mi, and
  another object,</span> <span m='29930'>we'll label that with mass mj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='31580'>These are small mass elements in the body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='34700'>And we'd like to know something about the internal
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='39410'>Now, let's make the assumption-- and
  this is the key property--</span> <span m='42860'>that the force due to this
  interaction between j</span> <span m='45800'>and the i-th particle pointing
  that way-- and here's</span> <span m='49355'>the Newton's third law pair--
  that these forces lie--</span> <span m='54660'>are directed along the line
  connecting the two bodies.</span> </p><p><span m='58190'>With this assumption,
  we'll now show</span> <span m='59990'>that the torque due to these two
  internal forces, [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m='63890'>Newton's third law pairs
  will cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='66270'>So let's calculate that out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='68330'>So we draw our vector from rsi, and our other vector
  rsj.</span> </p><p><span m='78080'>And now we're in position to add these two
  torques.</span> </p><p><span m='80810'>So we have the torque on s due to this
  pair is</span> <span m='85400'>equal to the sum of rsi cross fji plus</span>
  <span m='93650'>rs-- that's an r-- make sure we get that right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='100700'>We have rsj cross fij.</span> </p><p><span
  m='107479'>Now, the third law pair says fji is equal to minus fiji.</span>
  </p><p><span m='115460'>And so, if we substitute-- let's put the minus sign
  over here--</span> <span m='119200'>we get rsi minus rsj cross fji.</span>
  </p><p><span m='132630'>Now, let's look at this vector in particular.</span>
  </p><p><span m='136060'>We can draw it again over here, just to see it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='138890'>Here s.</span> </p><p><span m='140760'>Here is
  rsi.</span> </p><p><span m='144474'>Here is the vector rs, that's rsj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='154210'>And we want to now consider the vector rsi minus
  rsj.</span> </p><p><span m='162250'>Notice that this vector is directed</span>
  <span m='165250'>along the lines connecting the i-th and the j-th
  particle.</span> </p><p><span m='170290'>And we've made an assumption that fji
  is also</span> <span m='174730'>along that line.</span> </p><p><span
  m='176000'>So these two vectors, in this particular case,</span> <span
  m='178990'>are either parallel or anti-parallel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='184960'>And hence, the torque due to the sum of these internal</span> <span
  m='190240'>forces cancel in pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='193210'>And this
  means we only need to address</span> <span m='195490'>the torque due to
  external forces that</span> <span m='197950'>are acting on individual elements
  in a body.</span> </p><p></p>
