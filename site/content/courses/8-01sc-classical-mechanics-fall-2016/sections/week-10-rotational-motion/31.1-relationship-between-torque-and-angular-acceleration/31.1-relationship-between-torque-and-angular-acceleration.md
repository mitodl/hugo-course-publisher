title: 31.1 Relationship between Torque and Angular Acceleration
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3370'>We now would like to consider the motion</span> <span
  m='5110'>of a rigid body that's undergoing angular</span> <span
  m='8020'>acceleration about some axis.</span> </p><p><span m='9940'>So let's
  consider, for simplicity, a disk.</span> </p><p><span m='14590'>And we have an
  axis that's passing through some point,</span> <span m='17620'>as here is the
  center, but that's not crucial.</span> </p><p><span m='21340'>And we want to
  consider the fact that this object--</span> <span m='26340'>we'll call this
  our Z-axis-- K hat unit</span> <span m='28540'>vector in that
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='29960'>So it's pointing up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='31690'>And this object is undergoing an angular
  acceleration</span> <span m='35380'>where alpha Z is the Z component of the
  angular acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='40270'>Now, what we'd like to
  consider is the torque on the subject.</span> </p><p><span m='45070'>So the
  way we'll do it is we'll divide the object</span> <span m='47620'>into a bunch
  of pieces.</span> </p><p><span m='49450'>And let's identify a piece here as
  Delta MJ.</span> </p><p><span m='54640'>That's that piece.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56140'>And this piece has some force acting on it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='60790'>Now, this force can be a vector.</span> </p><p><span m='64750'>But
  the important thing to realize</span> <span m='67120'>is that this force is
  only the external force,</span> <span m='71650'>because we've already got to
  make</span> <span m='73300'>the assumption that all internal torques cancel in
  pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='76570'>And we'll show that in the video a little
  bit later.</span> </p><p><span m='80090'>So we're only considering the
  external forces that</span> <span m='82480'>are acting on this element.</span>
  </p><p><span m='84440'>And recall that we have the vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='87789'>RS to J is the vector.</span> </p><p><span m='91480'>From point S to
  where this mass element is.</span> </p><p><span m='95259'>And now what we'd
  like to do is calculate the torque.</span> </p><p><span m='99640'>In general
  torque is given by the expression--</span> <span m='103850'>we'll sum over all
  the elements.</span> </p><p><span m='106660'>J goes from 1 to N. And it's the
  cross-product of our SJ cross</span> <span m='115930'>FJ external.</span>
  </p><p><span m='118410'>Now, our goal here is only to calculate</span> <span
  m='123730'>the Z component of the torque.</span> </p><p><span m='126340'>So we
  can simplify our understanding</span> <span m='129100'>a little bit by writing
  out this vector F external J</span> <span m='136750'>as a component in the
  plane.</span> </p><p><span m='141040'>And in order to describe that we'll
  choose some unit vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='145880'>R hat theta hat going
  into the plane.</span> </p><p><span m='149620'>We'll make another picture in a
  moment.</span> </p><p><span m='151880'>So our vector can have an R
  component.</span> </p><p><span m='156170'>And I'll keep the external in
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='158620'>It can have a theta hat
  component.</span> </p><p><span m='162040'>And it can also have a Z
  component.</span> </p><p><span m='167320'>But recall that a cross-product is
  always</span> <span m='171460'>perpendicular to either of the elements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='175280'>So when I cross R with anything in the K
  direction</span> <span m='180490'>then that component will give a
  component</span> <span m='183510'>that's not in the Z direction, and so I can
  ignore that.</span> </p><p><span m='187550'>So my first simplification is to
  say that the Z component will</span> <span m='193840'>only come from the cross
  product of RSJ, with these two pieces.</span> </p><p><span m='202210'>So
  that's cross FJR R hat plus FJ theta theta hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211739'>Now, again we can make another simplification,</span> <span
  m='213655'>and perhaps here it's helpful to have another overhead view.</span>
  </p><p><span m='219490'>And here's our mas element, delta NJ.</span>
  </p><p><span m='224800'>That's our vector from F, from the center, to delta
  NJ.</span> </p><p><span m='230700'>We have unit vectors, R hat, and theta
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='236190'>And so we see that this vector, RSJ, has
  some length in the R</span> <span m='245520'>hat direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='249030'>So we're picking S as the origin of our coordinate
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='254830'>This can generalize.</span>
  </p><p><span m='255890'>So we don't worry about if the object is not
  symmetric.</span> </p><p><span m='260329'>So when you take the cross product
  of R hat verse R hat,</span> <span m='264790'>that also is zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='266500'>And so we see our simplification is quite nice, that
  the Z</span> <span m='270740'>component of the torque, is only arising from
  the sum of J</span> <span m='275380'>goes from 1 to N of our RSJ.</span>
  </p><p><span m='279290'>Well, we've already-- we'll write this all as
  vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='282790'>R ht cross F J theta theta hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='290630'>Now, again, even if our external force-- by the
  way,</span> <span m='295909'>we're dropping external.</span> </p><p><span
  m='297560'>We can always say external, but I think, for simplicity,
  we'll</span> <span m='301700'>now drop the external.</span> </p><p><span
  m='305220'>And what we're considering is just</span> <span m='309290'>the
  component of the force.</span> </p><p><span m='311870'>We can write that FJ--
  this is a little complicated-- theta.</span> </p><p><span m='317390'>Just the
  theta hat component of that force.</span> </p><p><span m='323480'>This is the
  only piece of the force</span> <span m='326330'>that matters in contributing
  to the Z component of the torque.</span> </p><p><span m='330300'>And this
  cross-product is very direct</span> <span m='332659'>because we've chosen a
  right handed system, where</span> <span m='335030'>R hat cross theta hat is K
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='340900'>So we see that this becomes J equals
  1</span> <span m='347070'>to N of RSJ FJ theta in the K hat direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='355520'>Now, that's just the calculation of the torque.</span>
  </p><p><span m='358900'>But, as always, it's crucial to understand</span>
  <span m='361510'>where Newton's second law appears in these
  calculations.</span> </p><p><span m='365170'>And Newton's second law, for this
  mass element,</span> <span m='368830'>delta MJ, So the second law is telling
  us</span> <span m='374490'>that the tangential force is proportional</span>
  <span m='378240'>to the mass element times the tangential acceleration</span>
  <span m='382850'>of that mass element.</span> </p><p><span m='384900'>Now, for
  this type of rotation about the Z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='390130'>So when
  we're rotating about that Z-axis</span> <span m='393360'>we know that AJ
  theta, so the acceleration</span> <span m='400770'>of this tangential element,
  is just proportional</span> <span m='403380'>to RJ distance from-- well we've
  called that our RSJ--</span> <span m='409500'>so how far away from the
  center?</span> </p><p><span m='411720'>And here's the key thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='413670'>It's also proportional to the Z component of the
  angular</span> <span m='417480'>acceleration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='418710'>And every mass element in the body has the same alpha Z.</span>
  </p><p><span m='424620'>And so our sum, for the torque, can now</span> <span
  m='427740'>be written in the following way.</span> </p><p><span m='431020'>The
  Z component of the torque-- now,</span> <span m='433050'>I'm going to do
  something here, which</span> <span m='434730'>is, I'll write J equals 1 to N,
  a parnetheses mark.</span> </p><p><span m='440310'>I have one of the
  RSJs.</span> </p><p><span m='442500'>I have another RSJ.</span> </p><p><span
  m='444310'>A delta MJ.</span> </p><p><span m='446310'>So I have delta MJ RSJ
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='450030'>But every single component has the
  same alpha Z.</span> </p><p><span m='455100'>And we're in the K hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='459040'>Now, because we have a continuous
  body we have to,</span> <span m='463200'>again, consider a limit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='465670'>So let's call the limit as delta MJ goes to 0 of this
  sum,</span> <span m='475290'>delta MJ RSJ squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='479760'>Well that's an integral over the body of DMRS squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='487800'>And we identified that before as the moment of
  inertia</span> <span m='491820'>about the Z-axis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='494530'>So the quandary in parentheses is just</span> <span m='497370'>a
  measure of the mass distribution about the axis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='501330'>You see the R squared, the delta MJ.</span> </p><p><span
  m='503970'>And so in conclusion we have that the Z component</span> <span
  m='508140'>of the torque is equal to IS alpha Z K</span> <span m='514260'>hat,
  which is now a vector, because that's the vector</span> <span
  m='518039'>alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='519419'>And this is our crucial
  result for a body that's</span> <span m='525930'>rotating about the
  Z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='528870'>This result can generalize to not
  just</span> <span m='531960'>a disk, but any body that's looking at the Z
  component,</span> <span m='538230'>for this fixed axis rotation.</span>
