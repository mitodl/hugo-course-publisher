title: 30.2 Cross Product
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3390'>There's another vector operation,</span> <span
  m='5380'>which we call the vector product and sometimes this operation</span>
  <span m='11670'>is called the cross product.</span> </p><p><span m='14310'>And
  this is taking two vectors A, the operation cross,</span> <span m='20100'>B.
  And this will give a new vector C.</span> </p><p><span m='23490'>And now we
  want to define that new vector C.</span> </p><p><span m='26190'>So let's draw
  a three dimensional</span> <span m='28470'>picture where we have a
  plane.</span> </p><p><span m='33890'>And on this plane, we have two vectors A
  and B.</span> </p><p><span m='45560'>And those vectors are forming an angle
  theta between them.</span> </p><p><span m='50010'>Now a plane defines two unit
  normals.</span> </p><p><span m='53480'>I'll draw one up, which I'm
  going</span> <span m='56270'>to call n hat right hand rule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='60500'>And the reason for that right-hand rule</span> <span
  m='62990'>is if we take A cross B, then our right hand thumb</span> <span
  m='69440'>is pointing in the perpendicular direction to the plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='73820'>Now I could have chosen a unit vector down,</span>
  <span m='79789'>n hat left-hand rule.</span> </p><p><span m='82550'>And this
  would correspond to taking my left hand</span> <span m='86570'>and having A
  cross B pointing down.</span> </p><p><span m='90800'>So the way we're going to
  define our cross-product</span> <span m='95030'>is with the right-hand
  rule.</span> </p><p><span m='97310'>And so we define it like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='99830'>That the vector C has magnitude, the magnitude</span>
  <span m='105979'>of A times sine of theta, the magnitude of B,</span> <span
  m='112280'>and its direction is given by the right-hand rule.</span>
  </p><p><span m='118170'>Now one of the reasons for this definition</span>
  <span m='122720'>is let's draw a vector A and a vector B.</span> </p><p><span
  m='130880'>When you have two vectors, they define a magnitude</span> <span
  m='135890'>in the following way.</span> </p><p><span m='138110'>That we can
  think about any two vectors</span> <span m='141020'>define an area of a
  parallelogram.</span> </p><p><span m='144410'>And we can define that area as
  follows.</span> </p><p><span m='148010'>Let's drop a perpendicular.</span>
  </p><p><span m='151460'>And let's call this B perp.</span> </p><p><span
  m='154640'>Then the area, which is a positive quantity,</span> <span
  m='159260'>is given by-- and by the way, our angle theta</span> <span
  m='164720'>here will be always positive-- so we're</span> <span
  m='168079'>going to make it 0 theta pi.</span> </p><p><span m='173540'>And
  that way sine of theta is always a positive quantity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='178160'>The area is the height, so that B perp times the base,</span> <span
  m='184560'>which is the magnitude of A, and so we can write that as A,</span>
  <span m='193090'>and the magnitude of B perp is B sine theta.</span>
  </p><p><span m='198910'>So this quantity, B sine theta, is precisely
  what's</span> <span m='203829'>occurring there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='205430'>So the magnitude of C is equal to the area formed</span> <span
  m='211210'>by the vectors A and B. And we have</span> <span m='214780'>a
  choice of which way we want to pick C to point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='219490'>And that's where, as a convention,</span> <span m='221530'>we're
  choosing the right-hand rule.</span> </p><p><span m='224540'>Now again, there
  is a symmetry here</span> <span m='227550'>in that I can also define the area
  of that triangle</span> <span m='231790'>in the following way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='232850'>Let's write this, theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='234940'>Instead of taking how much of B is</span> <span
  m='237340'>perpendicular to the direction of A,</span> <span m='239770'>let's
  drop the perpendicular this way,</span> <span m='242680'>and write that as a
  perp.</span> </p><p><span m='245890'>And then the same area can be
  expressed</span> <span m='252910'>as the magnitude of-- well, we'll express
  it</span> <span m='256980'>as A perp times B. And A perp is the
  magnitude</span> <span m='263560'>of A sine theta times the magnitude of
  B.</span> </p><p><span m='268780'>And that's our same definition as
  before.</span> </p><p><span m='272090'>And so you see, a sine theta is
  appearing over here.</span> </p><p><span m='278230'>So in either choice, our
  vector operation</span> <span m='283150'>says take any two vectors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='285760'>Any two vectors forms a parallelogram.</span>
  </p><p><span m='289540'>The area of that parallelogram is the magnitude</span>
  <span m='292420'>of the vector product.</span> </p><p><span m='294250'>And the
  direction of this new vector C</span> <span m='297820'>is given by the
  right-hand rule with respect</span> <span m='300070'>to that parallelogram in
  that sense.</span> </p><p></p>
