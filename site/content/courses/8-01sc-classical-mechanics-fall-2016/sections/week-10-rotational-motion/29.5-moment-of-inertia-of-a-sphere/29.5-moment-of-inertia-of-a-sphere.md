title: 29.5 Moment of Inertia of a Sphere
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3760'>I would now like to calculate the moment of inertia</span>
  <span m='6220'>of a uniform sphere.</span> </p><p><span m='12440'>And it has a
  mass m and radius r.</span> </p><p><span m='15390'>I'm going to look at three
  axes.</span> </p><p><span m='18810'>So I'll call this the x-axis, the y-axis,
  and the z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='24640'>And first, let's calculate the
  moment about the z-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='29130'>So if I write down our
  definition,</span> <span m='31770'>and I'm going to calculate it about the
  center of mass,</span> <span m='34470'>so the moment about the z-axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='38110'>How do we do that?</span> </p><p><span m='39040'>Well,
  we take a mass element, and have to be a little bit</span> <span
  m='42270'>careful here.</span> </p><p><span m='43920'>Because if you think
  about what is</span> <span m='46680'>our [? perp ?] for this mass
  element,</span> <span m='49890'>it's actually x squared plus y squared,
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='54870'>So the distance here, because it's
  going in a circle,</span> <span m='58230'>the radius of that circle is x
  squared plus y squared.</span> </p><p><span m='62200'>So we have x squared
  plus y squared,</span> <span m='65160'>and we're integrating over the
  sphere.</span> </p><p><span m='67620'>Now, this looks like a tough
  integral.</span> </p><p><span m='70050'>But let's now look at what would the
  moment of inertia</span> <span m='73210'>be about the x-axis?</span>
  </p><p><span m='75820'>Well, the only difference here is I'm integrating now,
  first,</span> <span m='79320'>if it's rotating about this axis,</span> <span
  m='81780'>and I had my mass element, instead</span> <span m='84390'>of x
  squared plus y squared about the z-axis,</span> <span m='87330'>it's y squared
  plus z squared about the x-axis.</span> </p><p><span m='91890'>That's the
  perpendicular distance.</span> </p><p><span m='94570'>And if I calculate the
  moment of inertia about the y-axis,</span> <span m='98820'>then same
  argument-- I have z squared plus x squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='104970'>Now, the beauty of this problem--</span> <span m='107931'>and in
  physics, when we talk about beauty,</span> <span m='109680'>we often talk
  about symmetry-- is</span> <span m='111630'>that by the symmetry of the
  sphere, all of these moments</span> <span m='115259'>are equal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120460'>And let's call that I cm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='125320'>Now, if I add these three pieces together, what do I get?</span>
  </p><p><span m='131350'>So if I add I cm z plus I cm x plus I cm y,</span>
  <span m='139900'>I get 3 times the moment about the center of the axes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='144620'>So what happens when I add these three
  integrals?</span> </p><p><span m='148000'>I get dm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='149170'>If you'll notice, x squared appears twice,</span> <span
  m='151300'>y squared appears twice, and z squared appears twice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155150'>So we get 2 times x squared plus y squared plus z
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='161740'>But x squared plus y squared plus z
  squared</span> <span m='165430'>is the radius of a small sphere of thickness
  dr.</span> </p><p><span m='175900'>And my mass element-- now I have to
  integrate over the sphere.</span> </p><p><span m='180790'>And so now our mass
  element, dm, is the volume density</span> <span m='187750'>of this times the
  volume.</span> </p><p><span m='194370'>Now what is the volume density?</span>
  </p><p><span m='196260'>Well, that's the total mass over 4/3 pi r
  cubed.</span> </p><p><span m='201079'>And what is the volume of a
  sphere</span> <span m='203150'>of radius r and thickness dr?</span>
  </p><p><span m='206150'>That's 4 pi r squared dr.</span> </p><p><span
  m='212120'>So if I put that into my expression, what</span> <span m='217220'>I
  get-- let's just get rid of the 4</span> <span m='219380'>pi's, and I get 3m
  over r cubed times r squared dr.</span> </p><p><span m='229550'>And so our 3 I
  cm, I have a factor of 2,</span> <span m='241580'>this integral becomes 2
  times dm times r squared.</span> </p><p><span m='250550'>And the dm is 3m r
  cubed r squares dr times</span> <span m='258200'>another r squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='260190'>And what are we integrating over are r variable
  from?</span> </p><p><span m='264220'>These spherical shells that we're
  integrating outward</span> <span m='268120'>go from r equal 0 to r equal
  capital R.</span> </p><p><span m='272450'>Notice that our 3 m's cancel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='276800'>And we'll just write this is I cm</span> <span
  m='280490'>equals factor 2 times m over r cubed times the integral of r</span>
  <span m='289340'>to the fourth dr from zero to R. And that's a simple
  integral</span> <span m='293930'>to do.</span> </p><p><span m='294430'>r to
  the fourth is r to the fifth divided by 5.</span> </p><p><span m='300840'>And
  so we get 2 over 5 m R to the fifth over R cubed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='308270'>And we conclude that the moment of inertia</span> <span
  m='310760'>about any of the axes of the sphere is 2/5 m R squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='318470'>And in this calculation, it's a beautiful
  example</span> <span m='321740'>of how we use the symmetry of the sphere to
  simplify</span> <span m='325130'>very complicated integrals.</span> </p>
