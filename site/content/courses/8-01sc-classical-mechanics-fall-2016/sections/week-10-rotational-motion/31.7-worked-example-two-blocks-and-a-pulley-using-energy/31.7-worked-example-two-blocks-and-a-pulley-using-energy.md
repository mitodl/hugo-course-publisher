transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3960'>When we used our energy principle,</span> <span
  m='5940'>suppose we have an object that starts at a height h0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='10910'>And this object is dropped, and when it gets to the
  ground,</span> <span m='15110'>it has some final velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='17542'>And when we applied our energy principle,</span> <span
  m='19250'>assuming that there was no air resistance, what</span> <span
  m='22340'>we saw was that the change in kinetic energy plus the change</span>
  <span m='25850'>of potential energy was 0, so we had 0 was equal to
  delta</span> <span m='29450'>k plus delta u.</span> </p><p><span m='32180'>And
  we saw that the kinetic energy</span> <span m='34040'>changed by 1/2 mv
  squared, and the potential energy changed</span> <span m='38690'>by minus mg
  h0.</span> </p><p><span m='41480'>So we can compute the velocity of the
  object</span> <span m='45020'>as it's falling given by square root of 2g
  h0.</span> </p><p><span m='51020'>Now that we're considering kinetic energy of
  rotation,</span> <span m='55130'>recall that we show that the kinetic
  energy</span> <span m='57890'>of a pure rotation about a fixed axis</span>
  <span m='60980'>was 1/2 the moment of inertia about</span> <span
  m='63980'>that axis times the angular speed squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='68960'>We now would like to apply our energy principle</span> <span
  m='71720'>to include rotational kinetic energy along</span> <span
  m='75350'>with the translational kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='77960'>And the example that we want to look at</span> <span m='80000'>is
  something very simple.</span> </p><p><span m='81260'>Suppose we have a
  pulley.</span> </p><p><span m='83210'>Now our pulley has a mass p, and
  we'll</span> <span m='86000'>say it has a moment of inertia of the pulley
  about the fixed</span> <span m='90380'>axis passing through the center of the
  pulley.</span> </p><p><span m='92870'>And we have a mass 1 and another block
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='99890'>And let's suppose that we release this
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='103830'>And for the moment let's make this
  surface frictionless.</span> </p><p><span m='110050'>And suppose that block 2
  falls down a certain distance.</span> </p><p><span m='116070'>So in the final
  state, block 2 will</span> <span m='119180'>have dropped a distance each
  final</span> <span m='124050'>from its initial position.</span> </p><p><span
  m='128270'>And what we like to consider is find</span> <span m='132590'>the
  velocity final of block 2.</span> </p><p><span m='136310'>So we begin in the
  same way that we've done this before,</span> <span m='140840'>by considering
  our energy diagrams.</span> </p><p><span m='143780'>And so we'll have an
  initial state.</span> </p><p><span m='148880'>And in our initial state, what
  we'll do</span> <span m='151670'>is we'll just have the initial 1, 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='157790'>And I'm going to choose u equals 0, here's my
  pulley.</span> </p><p><span m='164000'>And everything is at rest.</span>
  </p><p><span m='167520'>And so in the initial state, the initial energy,
  i</span> <span m='171430'>initial, k initial, plus u initial is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='176329'>And in our final state, we have the pulley</span>
  <span m='180350'>is rotating with omega final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='186650'>Block 1 is moving with a velocity v final 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='192260'>And block 2 is also moving with v2 final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='199370'>And let's just suppose that this was our u equals 0
  position.</span> </p><p><span m='203730'>And although it's not so clear in the
  diagram, u final,</span> <span m='209570'>it has moved down to height h
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='213350'>So what is the energy in our final
  state?</span> </p><p><span m='217700'>Well, we have to consider all the
  different pieces.</span> </p><p><span m='220220'>We have block 1, 1/2 m1, v1
  final squared.</span> </p><p><span m='225829'>We have the motion of block 2,
  1/2 m2 v2 final squared.</span> </p><p><span m='231980'>And we also have the
  kinetic energy</span> <span m='233510'>of the pulley, which is given by 1/2 I
  about the pulley</span> <span m='240140'>omega final squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='242180'>And what about our final potential energy?</span>
  </p><p><span m='245070'>Well, we've dropped the height, h final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='247880'>So we have block 2 has moved minus m2 gh final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='255110'>And now we have our two energy states.</span>
  </p><p><span m='258800'>And what we'd like to consider is apply the energy
  principle</span> <span m='262880'>just like we applied it for this simple
  case.</span> </p><p><span m='266690'>But before we do that, there is a
  constraint condition</span> <span m='270740'>that because the rope is fixed in
  length, as block 1 moves,</span> <span m='280840'>the pulley is rotating and
  block 2 is moving.</span> </p><p><span m='283810'>What we'll have is fixed and
  not slipping.</span> </p><p><span m='288260'>So as the rope moves around the
  pulley,</span> <span m='291220'>the pulley is moving with the same motion as
  the rope,</span> <span m='295030'>and the rope is moving with the speeds of
  block 1 and 2,</span> <span m='298300'>so we see that v1 final is equal to v2
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='303280'>And now what about the pulley?</span>
  </p><p><span m='304810'>If this is radius r, we know that the velocity</span>
  <span m='309520'>of a point on the rim of a disk is</span> <span
  m='313330'>moving with the speed of the rope, which</span> <span m='315940'>is
  the speed of block 1 and block 2,</span> <span m='317890'>So that's our omega
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='321610'>And so that makes our final energy,
  let's now gather terms.</span> </p><p><span m='327940'>The velocities are the
  same.</span> </p><p><span m='330310'>So we have 1/2 and 1 plus m2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='334720'>And we'll just call this the final for
  simplicity.</span> </p><p><span m='338310'>1/2 m2 times v final
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='342070'>That accounts for these two
  terms.</span> </p><p><span m='345130'>And we have the moment of inertia,
  kinetic energy</span> <span m='348820'>associated with the wheel, which is
  1/2i omega final squared,</span> <span m='353630'>which is v final squared
  over r squared minus m2 gh final.</span> </p><p><span m='363370'>And so now we
  can solve our energy principle, which</span> <span m='368620'>is because we're
  assuming everything's frictionless,</span> <span m='371650'>we have 0 equals E
  final minus E initial,</span> <span m='378310'>implies that E final equals E
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='381220'>And we chose our initial potential
  energy to be 0.</span> </p><p><span m='386590'>So of course that's just a
  choice of constant.</span> </p><p><span m='389410'>So I can now solve this
  equation by setting E final equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='396340'>That's
  the same statement.</span> </p><p><span m='398120'>And then you can see
  algebraically I</span> <span m='400360'>can solve for V final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='403330'>And what I get is I'm just going to write all these
  terms over.</span> </p><p><span m='408190'>I get m2gh final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='414400'>I'm going to divide by this common coefficient, 1/2
  and 1</span> <span m='421050'>plus m2 plus the moment of inertia</span> <span
  m='428390'>divided by radius squared.</span> </p><p><span m='432020'>And I now
  have to take the square root of the whole thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='436980'>And that's how I can find the velocity of block 2</span> <span
  m='441650'>when it's dropped down a certain distance to h final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='445220'>So here we've generalized our energy approach</span>
  <span m='448790'>to include rotational kinetic energy.</span> </p><p></p>
