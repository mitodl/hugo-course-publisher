title: 30.5 Torque from Gravity
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3630'>We would now like to consider a system of particles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6690'>And let's draw them as 1, 2, 3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='11940'>And let's refer to this one as the j particle of mass mj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='17100'>And these particles, system of particles</span> <span
  m='19500'>is in a gravitational field.</span> </p><p><span m='21180'>And I
  would like to consider the torque about some point</span> <span m='24420'>s
  for this system of particles.</span> </p><p><span m='26420'>And in particular,
  I'd like to know</span> <span m='28140'>how do I treat the gravitational force
  that's acting on all</span> <span m='31410'>of these individual
  particles.</span> </p><p><span m='33540'>Well, the way we'll analyze this
  is</span> <span m='36510'>recall that the definition of torque about some
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='41460'>Now we have n particles labeled by index
  j.</span> </p><p><span m='46080'>It's a vector from the place we're</span>
  <span m='48180'>calculating the torque to where the j-th particle is
  located.</span> </p><p><span m='52710'>So we draw that vector rsj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='56280'>And we cross that with the force that's</span> <span
  m='58560'>acting on the j-th particle, which in this case</span> <span
  m='61710'>is the gravitational force mjg.</span> </p><p><span m='67230'>And
  this is the torque about s, and it's this complicated sum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='71690'>But the sum will simplify in the following way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='73950'>Let's just write out a couple of terms</span> <span m='75570'>to see
  what it actually looks like.</span> </p><p><span m='77380'>So we have rs1
  cross m1g plus rs2 cross m2g.</span> </p><p><span m='87240'>And we just keep
  on going for the n terms.</span> </p><p><span m='90060'>Now quantity m1 is the
  scalar units of kilograms in SI units.</span> </p><p><span m='96270'>But the
  cross product is between this vector and that vector.</span> </p><p><span
  m='99870'>So I can actually rewrite this as m1 rs1 cross g</span> <span
  m='105570'>plus m2 rs2 cross g, et cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='111509'>And
  you see that the g term is the same</span> <span m='114300'>for every single
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='116320'>So I can write this sum-- j goes from 1
  to n as mj rsj</span> <span m='123900'>and pull the g out of the sum, because
  every term has</span> <span m='128190'>the same g in the cross product.</span>
  </p><p><span m='130650'>Now let's focus on the meaning of this sum,</span>
  <span m='133440'>where we're weighting position by mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='136470'>Recall that if you have the center of mass of an object,</span>
  <span m='141090'>and we wanted to find out where is</span> <span
  m='142800'>the location of the center of mass with respect to point s,</span>
  <span m='146880'>then we can calculate this vector rs cm by our
  definition</span> <span m='152910'>that the location of the center of mass
  with respect to s</span> <span m='158940'>is given by the sum j goes from 1 to
  n of mj rsj.</span> </p><p><span m='166860'>And we divide that by the total
  mass mj.</span> </p><p><span m='171840'>We'll denote this term by m total for
  the total mass.</span> </p><p><span m='176460'>So what we see here is the
  total mass times</span> <span m='179250'>Rscm is equal to exactly the sum that
  we</span> <span m='184530'>have in that expression mj rsj.</span> </p><p><span
  m='188790'>That's precisely that term.</span> </p><p><span m='191730'>And so
  we can conclude that the torque about the center of mass</span> <span
  m='196140'>is m total Rscm cross g.</span> </p><p><span m='201090'>Now
  remember again m total is a scalar.</span> </p><p><span m='203760'>The cross
  product is between these two vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='206680'>And so
  finally, we write this as Rscm cross m total g.</span> </p><p><span
  m='214829'>And this is how we apply the gravitational force</span> <span
  m='218220'>to a system of particles.</span> </p><p><span m='219870'>Now what
  does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='221890'>Well, that's just denote our
  system like this,</span> <span m='225210'>and let's say here is the center of
  mass,</span> <span m='227910'>and here's the point s.</span> </p><p><span
  m='229960'>So what we need to do is we need to draw the vector Rscm,</span>
  <span m='237680'>and apply all the gravitational force at the center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='243260'>And then our torque about s is the vector
  Rs</span> <span m='246890'>to where the force is acting cross m total
  g.</span> </p><p><span m='249920'>So in conclusion, when you have a rigid body
  or a system</span> <span m='252980'>of particles, and you want to
  calculate</span> <span m='254930'>the torque due to a uniform gravitational
  field,</span> <span m='258500'>then we place-- the total gravitational force
  is</span> <span m='263540'>acting at the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='265490'>And that gives us the torque about s</span> <span m='267710'>to the
  individual torques of the system</span> <span m='271930'>of the gravitational
  force about s.</span> </p><p><span m='274550'>All the force is placed at the
  center of mass.</span> </p><p></p>
