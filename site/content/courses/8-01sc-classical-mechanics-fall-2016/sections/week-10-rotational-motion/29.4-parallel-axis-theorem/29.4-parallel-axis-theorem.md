title: 29.4 Parallel Axis Theorem
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3410'>We've defined moment of inertia of a rigid body
  already.</span> </p><p><span m='6680'>And we often are interested in
  it,</span> <span m='8540'>because when we rotate a body about an axis,</span>
  <span m='11180'>say an axis that's passing through the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='14310'>Then our kinetic energy depends in that moment of
  inertia</span> <span m='16790'>through that axis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='18230'>But we may also want to consider rotation about another axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='23120'>So suppose we consider an axis passing</span> <span
  m='25460'>through close to the end and we rotate</span> <span m='27770'>the
  body around this axis.</span> </p><p><span m='30740'>You can see from overhead
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='35090'>Then we want to now consider how the
  mass is distributed</span> <span m='39140'>about an axis that was parallel to
  the axis passing</span> <span m='42710'>through the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='44540'>So we'll now make a little calculation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='47090'>But first, we want to quote the theorem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49200'>So let's just draw an example of our rigid body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='53120'>And let's take the center of mass,</span> <span
  m='55250'>and let's consider an axis that's going perpendicular</span> <span
  m='57710'>to the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='59000'>We can think of
  the object is rotating about that axis.</span> </p><p><span m='63430'>And now
  let's consider another axis passing</span> <span m='65780'>through a different
  point, but also parallel</span> <span m='69830'>to this axis separated by a
  distance d.</span> </p><p><span m='73580'>Then the result that we want is at
  the moment of inertia</span> <span m='78470'>about an axis passing
  perpendicular</span> <span m='80720'>to the plane of the object through the
  axis s</span> <span m='84050'>is equal to the moment of inertia about an
  axis</span> <span m='87680'>passing through the center of mass--</span> <span
  m='89390'>notice these are parallel axes-- plus the mass</span> <span
  m='92509'>of the object times the distance between the two parallel
  axes.</span> </p><p><span m='98509'>And this is a result that is very useful
  when</span> <span m='101420'>calculating moments of inertia.</span>
  </p><p><span m='102979'>Of course, we could calculate the moment</span> <span
  m='105020'>about any axis we wanted.</span> </p><p><span m='106950'>And we'll
  see that in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='108500'>For example, we know that
  for a rod of length L</span> <span m='114310'>that the moment of inertia
  through the center of mass</span> <span m='117560'>was 1/12.</span>
  </p><p><span m='118759'>And let's call the length of the rod L. So we have a
  length L.</span> </p><p><span m='124780'>And let's assume it's a uniform
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='128660'>And we'll calculate a moment of inertia
  through an axis</span> <span m='132050'>through the end.</span> </p><p><span
  m='133670'>And so in this case, d is equal to L over 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='137540'>And so I about the end axis is 1/12 mL</span> <span
  m='143210'>squared plus the mass times L over 2 square</span> <span
  m='148970'>and a 12 plus a quarter is 1/3 mL squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='154340'>And that means that all you need to know</span> <span m='157280'>is
  the moment through the center of mass,</span> <span m='159530'>and you can
  calculate the moment through any other axis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='162650'>Very useful theorem called the parallel axis theorem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='169040'>Now as I said, we can calculate the moment s.</span>
  </p><p><span m='174200'>And just to show you very quickly, if we pick s
  here,</span> <span m='178640'>and we pick our little dm there, and we have a
  distance x,</span> <span m='183380'>then the moment about s-- and let's</span>
  <span m='186020'>say that dm is equal to the total mass divided</span> <span
  m='189860'>by the length times some little distance dx--</span> <span
  m='194060'>then the moment is dm times x squared, where x we'll</span> <span
  m='200450'>give this an integration variable</span> <span m='201980'>x prime
  goes from 0 to x prime equals l.</span> </p><p><span m='206000'>And so we have
  for our dm m over L dx prime.</span> </p><p><span m='211200'>Remember, that's
  our integration variable.</span> </p><p><span m='213829'>And we have x
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='216000'>So that's x prime squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='219110'>And this is just the integral of x cubed over
  3.</span> </p><p><span m='223100'>So we have 1/3 m over L x prime cubed
  evaluated from 0 to L,</span> <span m='230690'>and that comes out to 1/3 mL
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='235340'>And that's in agreement with the
  parallel axis theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='238910'>And that's an example of
  parallel axis theorems.</span> </p><p><span m='241010'>You can do the same
  thing with the disk or other objects.</span> </p><p></p>
