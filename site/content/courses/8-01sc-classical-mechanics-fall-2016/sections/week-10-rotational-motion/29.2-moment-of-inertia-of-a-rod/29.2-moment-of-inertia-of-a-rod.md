title: 29.2 Moment of Inertia of a Rod
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3795'>I would now like to show you how to calculate</span> <span
  m='5670'>the moment of inertia of a typical continuous body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='9240'>Let's consider a rigid rod, very thin.</span>
  </p><p><span m='12540'>And what we want to do is calculate</span> <span
  m='14070'>the moment of inertia of this body about the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18090'>Let's say the body is of length L, and it has total
  mass M.</span> </p><p><span m='23250'>Now, recall that the moment of
  inertia</span> <span m='25770'>about the center of mass we defined</span>
  <span m='27510'>as an integral of dm r-squared integrated over the
  body.</span> </p><p><span m='33360'>Now, our challenge today is to
  understand</span> <span m='35400'>exactly what all these terms are in this
  expression.</span> </p><p><span m='38610'>What is dm?</span> </p><p><span
  m='39600'>What is r?</span> </p><p><span m='40650'>And what do we mean by an
  integral over the body?</span> </p><p><span m='43120'>So now let's do a
  stepwise interpretation of each term.</span> </p><p><span m='46680'>The
  crucial thing is to introduce coordinates systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='50370'>So let's choose a coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52440'>And let's put the origin at the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='57039'>Now, the most important thing is that we're</span> <span
  m='58830'>going to do an integral.</span> </p><p><span m='60180'>So we need to
  introduce the integration variable.</span> </p><p><span m='64050'>And that's
  the hardest part of setting up intervals.</span> </p><p><span m='67930'>So
  what we want to do is arbitrarily choose</span> <span m='71130'>an element
  dm.</span> </p><p><span m='73980'>So there's our elements dm.</span>
  </p><p><span m='75810'>And here's our integration variable,</span> <span
  m='78060'>it's a distance x from the origin.</span> </p><p><span m='81180'>So
  that's the integration variable.</span> </p><p><span m='85410'>Now, there's
  two things when we set up the integral.</span> </p><p><span m='88650'>r is
  equal to that integration variable.</span> </p><p><span m='93420'>r is
  abstract in this expression,</span> <span m='95700'>but in this concrete
  realization it is the integration variable.</span> </p><p><span m='99670'>The
  second place the integration variables shows up is in dm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='103380'>dm is a mass in this small element.</span> </p><p><span
  m='106560'>But if we want to express that in terms of our integration</span>
  <span m='109560'>variable, we have to express it in terms of the
  differential</span> <span m='112930'>length dx.</span> </p><p><span
  m='115140'>So dm mass is equal to the total mass per unit length.</span>
  </p><p><span m='121050'>We're assuming the rod is uniform times</span> <span
  m='125010'>the length dx of our small piece.</span> </p><p><span
  m='128400'>And now we've set up the two pieces that are crucial</span> <span
  m='131430'>and all we have to think about now</span> <span m='133230'>is what
  does an integral mean.</span> </p><p><span m='135470'>Well, an integral means
  that we're dividing up the piece</span> <span m='138840'>into a bunch of small
  elements and we're</span> <span m='141720'>adding the contribution of each
  small element.</span> </p><p><span m='145030'>So in particular, when we write
  Icm equals-- now,</span> <span m='149730'>we can write it as m over
  Ldx.</span> </p><p><span m='153810'>That was our dm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='155880'>And the distance of dm from the point we're computing the
  axis</span> <span m='160560'>is x-squared.</span> </p><p><span m='162520'>Now,
  the question is what is our integration variable doing?</span> </p><p><span
  m='165240'>Well, x is going from minus L over 2-- that's at this end--</span>
  <span m='170570'>to x equals plus L over 2 on the other end.</span>
  </p><p><span m='174610'>So we have x minus L over 2x equals plus L over
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='180300'>And now we've set up the integral</span>
  <span m='182100'>for the moment of inertia, and the rest</span> <span
  m='183990'>is just doing an integral.</span> </p><p><span m='185400'>Recall
  that the integral of dx x-squared is x-cubed over 3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='192490'>And so this integral then simply becomes</span> <span
  m='194600'>Icm equals m over L x-cubed over 3-- evaluating</span> <span
  m='200460'>from the limits minus L over 2 to x equals plus L over 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='205980'>Again when you evaluate the limits, what</span> <span
  m='208920'>we get is m over L we have to put in L over 2 cubed divided</span>
  <span m='214920'>by 3 minus L over 2 cubed divided by 3,</span> <span
  m='221070'>and that's 1 over 2 cubed is an eighth-- divide</span> <span
  m='225500'>by third, that's the 24.</span> </p><p><span m='228120'>24 minus 24
  is a 12.</span> </p><p><span m='231690'>And so what we get for Icm is m over
  L,</span> <span m='237390'>12 L-cubed, or 1/12 m L-squared is</span> <span
  m='243390'>the moment of inertia about the center of mass</span> <span
  m='247140'>of our rigid rod.</span> </p><p><span m='248340'>And this is a
  measure of how the mass is</span> <span m='250800'>distributed about this
  axis.</span> </p><p></p>
