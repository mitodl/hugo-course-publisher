  <p><span m='1870'>How do we solve problems involving massive pulleys
  using</span> <span m='5500'>Newton's laws?</span> </p><p><span m='7300'>As a
  simple example, let's look at this problem,</span> <span m='9850'>consisting
  of a block of mass m1 hanging</span> <span m='12760'>from a massive pulley
  that has a moment of inertia I</span> <span m='16360'>and radius r.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18290'>We'll find the acceleration of the block, a1,</span>
  <span m='21820'>and the angular acceleration of the massive pulley,
  alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='26500'>It is critical to remember that the first
  step in solving</span> <span m='29300'>these problems is to define the
  positive x and y directions</span> <span m='33530'>and the positive direction
  of rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='36280'>In two-dimensional problems,
  you're</span> <span m='38240'>free to find any direction to be
  positive.</span> </p><p><span m='40960'>Here, we'll set our positive x and
  positive y like this.</span> </p><p><span m='45710'>Once we pick x and y, the
  direction</span> <span m='47390'>of the positive rotation is now also
  defined</span> <span m='50030'>by the right-hand rule.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52400'>You'll see shortly that defining positive directions</span> <span
  m='55190'>at the beginning will save you from a negative sign nightmare</span>
  <span m='58040'>later on.</span> </p><p><span m='60454'>Now let's break down
  Newton's laws for the different parts</span> <span m='62870'>of the
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='63872'>First, for the block, we will write down
  the linear version</span> <span m='68120'>of Newton's second law.</span>
  </p><p><span m='70770'>For the sum of forces, we have gravity pointing
  down</span> <span m='74210'>and tension pointing up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='76340'>According to the convention we just defined, T1 is positive</span>
  <span m='79340'>and m1g is negative.</span> </p><p><span m='82039'>Notice that
  since the block is accelerating,</span> <span m='84240'>T1 minus m1g is not 0
  but is equal to m1a1.</span> </p><p><span m='90110'>Notice that here we've set
  the signs for tension and weight,</span> <span m='93140'>but we don't yet know
  which were the block is accelerating.</span> </p><p><span m='96320'>So we just
  start by writing m1a1.</span> </p><p><span m='98950'>And if, in the end, we
  get that a1 is negative,</span> <span m='101320'>we'll know that it's actually
  accelerating</span> <span m='103070'>in the negative direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='106289'>Now let's look at the pulley.</span> </p><p><span
  m='108680'>Newton's second law in its rotational form</span> <span
  m='111410'>is tau is equal to I alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='114710'>For a
  normal pulley, the string is always</span> <span m='117440'>tangential to the
  side of the pulley.</span> </p><p><span m='120410'>So r and f are
  perpendicular, so that means</span> <span m='124640'>the torque is just T1
  times r.</span> </p><p><span m='127790'>What's the sign of this term?</span>
  </p><p><span m='130130'>Well, according to the positive direction that we
  defined,</span> <span m='132920'>this torque is positive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='135720'>Again, we'll leave the sign of the I alpha term</span> <span
  m='138800'>to be positive.</span> </p><p><span m='140000'>And alpha will turn
  out to be either positive or negative.</span> </p><p><span m='144810'>Finally,
  we need to connect these two equations.</span> </p><p><span m='147770'>Because
  the block is connected to the pulley using</span> <span m='150620'>an ideal,
  taut, inextensible rope,</span> <span m='153829'>a1 is going to be related to
  alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='155900'>We just need to figure out exactly how
  they're related.</span> </p><p><span m='158520'>In other words, we need to
  write down the constraint condition.</span> </p><p><span m='161930'>Let's say
  that the block hypothetically</span> <span m='165020'>is moving
  upwards.</span> </p><p><span m='166820'>In this case, what's happening to the
  pulley?</span> </p><p><span m='169579'>It must be spinning clockwise to pull
  the rope up</span> <span m='172340'>as the block goes in, so it has a
  clockwise angular velocity,</span> <span m='178290'>which, according to our
  convention, is negative.</span> </p><p><span m='181540'>In fact, if the pulley
  rotates a full turn</span> <span m='183750'>in the clockwise negative
  direction,</span> <span m='186120'>the angle changes by negative 2 pi,</span>
  <span m='189210'>and 2 pi times r of the rope will be pulled up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='193440'>So we can write that delta y is equal to negative r
  delta theta</span> <span m='198540'>or, taking some derivatives, a1 is equal
  to negative r</span> <span m='202890'>times alpha.</span> </p><p><span
  m='206150'>After setting the sign conventions,</span> <span m='208790'>writing
  Newton's laws for different parts of the system,</span> <span m='212000'>and
  then writing down the constraint condition,</span> <span m='215060'>we have
  three equations and three unknowns</span> <span m='217790'>for which we can
  now solve.</span> </p>
