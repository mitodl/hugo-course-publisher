  <p><span m='3660'>Let's determine the moment of inertia of a big wheel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='9330'>Here we have a big wheel and on the side it's attached
  here</span> <span m='14040'>at the center .</span> </p><p><span m='15270'>And
  there's a string going around here, and on that string</span> <span
  m='20160'>is a little mass hanging.</span> </p><p><span m='24030'>And our disk
  here has a radius R.</span> </p><p><span m='29370'>And we now want to in a
  little experiment</span> <span m='35550'>what the moment of inertia is of this
  disk.</span> </p><p><span m='37580'>And what we have to do is we have</span>
  <span m='39090'>to drop this mass to the ground, and we</span> <span
  m='45240'>need to measure what height is here,</span> <span m='48400'>and we
  need to measure how long it takes to drop.</span> </p><p><span m='51220'>So we
  need to measure t.</span> </p><p><span m='56200'>So how are we going to go
  about that?</span> </p><p><span m='58520'>Well the moment of inertia, that
  probably</span> <span m='61230'>has something to do with the torque of this
  wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='63870'>So we have to start doing a torque
  analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='67830'>So torque about the center of mass
  equals moment of inertia</span> <span m='73660'>about the center of mass times
  the angular acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='78820'>And we need to recall
  that the torque is</span> <span m='82350'>the product of the radius times the
  perpendicular force,</span> <span m='86610'>so we're going to have R here, and
  then</span> <span m='89760'>the force that's acting on this wheel</span> <span
  m='92789'>here is actually this tension force here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='97320'>So we are going to have our RT here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='101670'>And now we need to look at how things actually moving</span> <span
  m='107289'>with respect to coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='109509'>So if I let this mass drop, to the disk</span> <span
  m='113270'>it's going to spin clockwise.</span> </p><p><span m='115890'>So
  we're going to have theta hat going this way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='121620'>And if theta hat is going clockwise,</span> <span m='124230'>my k
  hat vector is going to go into the board.</span> </p><p><span m='129690'>And
  if k hat is going to go there,</span> <span m='132570'>and it's rotating
  clockwise, the angular acceleration</span> <span m='136820'>is going to go in
  the k hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='142600'>And if that is the case,
  then the torque</span> <span m='144650'>is going to follow suit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='146530'>So torque also goes into the board.</span>
  </p><p><span m='151410'>And so that means here we're going</span> <span
  m='153150'>to deal with k hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='155410'>And
  we're going to have Icm and then</span> <span m='158690'>alpha Z in the k hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='162420'>OK, so we can solve this I RT over
  alpha Z. OK,</span> <span m='171390'>well that's pretty good, but we have two
  unknowns-- the T</span> <span m='176760'>and the alpha Z. And we can use some
  other concepts to actually</span> <span m='181140'>get information on
  those.</span> </p><p><span m='183920'>The T, as you can guess already, plays a
  role here</span> <span m='188700'>in this massless string, so we can do a
  quick free body</span> <span m='193440'>diagram, an F equals ma analysis to
  get to that tension force.</span> </p><p><span m='202530'>So we have a little
  mass, m, here gravity is acting on it.</span> </p><p><span m='208380'>And we
  have this tension force here.</span> </p><p><span m='210360'>And we're going
  to put j hat down.</span> </p><p><span m='214140'>So we're going to get mg
  minus t, equals ma.</span> </p><p><span m='220560'>It's only going to go in y
  direction,</span> <span m='224079'>so we can just leave it here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='226600'>And we can solve this for t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='228960'>And then we have mg minus a.</span> </p><p><span m='237020'>OK,
  good, so we have that.</span> </p><p><span m='239190'>Now about the angular
  acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='242190'>And whenever there was a string
  going around a disk then,</span> <span m='246900'>we of course, have a
  constrained condition,</span> <span m='252210'>because the linear acceleration
  of this little mass going down</span> <span m='258660'>is related to the
  radius of the disk, times the angular</span> <span
  m='265050'>acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='266010'>So we can solve this
  for alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='268740'>And then we have a over R. So let's
  put that in here.</span> </p><p><span m='276700'>R, and then we have mg minus
  a over a,</span> <span m='284250'>and then we get another R here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='286540'>And we can write that a little bit more compact, mR
  squared g</span> <span m='293070'>over a minus 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='296380'>Good, so now we have one last hurdle, namely that a here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='304140'>That a we can't measure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='307290'>I said in the beginning, we want to make an experiment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='311250'>Actually we need experiment, because we can't
  otherwise</span> <span m='315540'>get to this a, so what we need is</span>
  <span m='317610'>a relation that connects what we can measure, which is the
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='323640'>It falls down the height here to the
  acceleration of this block.</span> </p><p><span m='329490'>And of course, that
  comes from one dimensional kinematics.</span> </p><p><span m='335370'>And we
  know that h equals 1/2 at squared, so we can solve for a.</span> </p><p><span
  m='348030'>2h over t squared.</span> </p><p><span m='353320'>And now we can
  stick that in here.</span> </p><p><span m='356560'>And we have mR squared, gt
  squared over 2h minus 1.</span> </p><p><span m='368660'>And let's just write
  this here again.</span> </p><p><span m='371530'>And that is our final
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='375220'>So now we have only measurable
  quantities here.</span> </p><p><span m='379380'>The t we can measure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='381390'>We just need a stopwatch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='384410'>And the h we can measure, as well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='388500'>And this actually already resembles,</span> <span m='392640'>if you
  know the theoretical, this already</span> <span m='397590'>resembles the
  theoretical solution,</span> <span m='400830'>which of course is for a
  disk.</span> </p><p><span m='404540'>1/2 mR squared, so that's what one
  expects for a disk.</span> </p><p><span m='412110'>And you see that we're very
  close, so this term here</span> <span m='415230'>is probably something like
  1.5, or should better</span> <span m='418500'>come out to be 1.5, because if
  we subtract 1,</span> <span m='421570'>we get to that 1/2 here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='423540'>And you can use it to in return-- in return,</span>
  <span m='426720'>you can also use it to predict the time</span> <span
  m='429390'>it takes to fall down if you know what the height is</span> <span
  m='433265'>or vice versa.</span> </p><p></p>
