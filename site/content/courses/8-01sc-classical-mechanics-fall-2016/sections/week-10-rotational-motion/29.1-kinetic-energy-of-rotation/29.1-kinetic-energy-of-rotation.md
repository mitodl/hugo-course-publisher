  <p><span m='3530'>We are now considering the motion of a rigid body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5690'>And we'd like to talk about kinetic energy of
  rotation</span> <span m='8360'>and properties of that rigid body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='10280'>Let's consider a rigid body, and let's</span> <span
  m='13640'>say that our rigid body is rotating about an axis passing</span>
  <span m='18440'>through a point S.</span> </p><p><span m='20810'>If we look
  overhead at our rigid body,</span> <span m='23660'>then what we're going to do
  is introduce a coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='28490'>So this is our
  overhead view.</span> </p><p><span m='31220'>And suppose that we have a small
  element of our rigid body</span> <span m='34940'>here, which I'm going to
  write as delta m j.</span> </p><p><span m='38300'>And that's a distance r j
  from the center.</span> </p><p><span m='42170'>Our rigid body has an angle
  theta.</span> </p><p><span m='45320'>And what we'd like to do is describe a
  coordinate system,</span> <span m='49170'>r hat, theta hat, and k hat pointing
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='54600'>Now, with this rigid body that's
  rotating,</span> <span m='58310'>we describe the angular velocity as the
  rate</span> <span m='62660'>that the angle is changing with respect to k
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='66230'>And so we can draw the vector omega,</span>
  <span m='68570'>and this establishes our coordinate system</span> <span
  m='70910'>for our rigid body and a small element of mass, delta m j.</span>
  </p><p><span m='76640'>Now, what we'd like to consider is</span> <span
  m='79220'>what does this mass element do?</span> </p><p><span
  m='80810'>Imagine that it's over there.</span> </p><p><span m='83360'>Because
  every point in the rigid body</span> <span m='85310'>has the same angular
  velocity, this object</span> <span m='89330'>is going in a circle with angular
  velocity omega.</span> </p><p><span m='92030'>Recall that omega is
  perpendicular to the plane</span> <span m='95060'>of motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='96050'>But the object itself has a velocity,</span> <span
  m='98780'>which I'm going to write v j.</span> </p><p><span m='100700'>And
  that velocity vector, v j, is in the tangential direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='106200'>And it's related to the z component of our angular</span> <span
  m='109009'>velocity by the following relationship--</span> <span
  m='111560'>it's how far we are from the center point,</span> <span
  m='114979'>S, times the z component of the angular velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='119180'>And it's pointing in the tangential direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='122310'>So remember that omega z is equal to d theta
  dt.</span> </p><p><span m='127760'>And this describes our coordinate
  system</span> <span m='130070'>for the rigid body.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131690'>Now what we'd like to discuss is the kinetic energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='134917'>And the way we're going to consider kinetic
  energy</span> <span m='137000'>is, we're going to sum up the rotational
  kinetic energy</span> <span m='140240'>of every single mass element.</span>
  </p><p><span m='142340'>So we begin by writing k j rotational.</span>
  </p><p><span m='147710'>And we know that that is just 1/2 times the mass
  element</span> <span m='152000'>times the velocity of that element
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='155520'>Now we can use our relationship for
  the tangential velocity</span> <span m='159380'>element related to the angular
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='162110'>And we have 1/2 delta m j r j squared
  times omega z squared.</span> </p><p><span m='170630'>Now keep in mind that
  omega z is the same for every single mass</span> <span m='174485'>element, but
  the distance of the mass elements</span> <span m='177470'>are all different by
  r j.</span> </p><p><span m='179690'>So the total rotational kinetic
  energy</span> <span m='183500'>is the sum over j from 1 to n of, let's</span>
  <span m='188870'>put the 1/2 outside, times delta m j r j squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='194540'>Now again, recall that every element has the same
  omega z.</span> </p><p><span m='199430'>So I can write parentheses omega z
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='204350'>And that's our rotational kinetic
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='206150'>So what we want to do now is look at
  the limit</span> <span m='209720'>as our delta m j becomes very small, because
  we</span> <span m='212270'>have a continuous body.</span> </p><p><span
  m='214070'>And we'll write a definition, which</span> <span m='217220'>is
  going to be the moment of inertia passing</span> <span m='219590'>through this
  point, S, about the axis passing through S</span> <span m='223400'>is equal to
  the limit as delta m j goes to 0</span> <span m='227660'>or n goes to infinity
  of this sum-- delta m j r j squared,</span> <span m='234740'>j goes from 1 to
  n.</span> </p><p><span m='237900'>Now because this is a limit for the
  continuous body,</span> <span m='243350'>we'll define it as the integral over
  the body</span> <span m='247700'>of a small mass element dm.</span>
  </p><p><span m='250580'>That's a distance r squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='253260'>Now here, what is the meaning of the r?</span> </p><p><span
  m='256670'>For our continuous body here, if we call this dm</span> <span
  m='261860'>and we define the distance from S to the body r-- and now</span>
  <span m='267790'>I'm going to just put a little notation in here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='270500'>It's the distance from S, the axis we're calculating
  about,</span> <span m='275630'>to where the body is dm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='277700'>So I'll write S dm.</span> </p><p><span m='280520'>This is what we
  call the moment of inertia</span> <span m='283700'>of a continuous
  body.</span> </p><p><span m='285620'>Now again, what's very important to
  realize--</span> <span m='288230'>it's a moment about a particular
  axis.</span> </p><p><span m='291300'>So this is about an axis passing
  perpendicular</span> <span m='301790'>to the plane of rotation and through S,
  point S.</span> </p><p><span m='311750'>So it's an axis that's passing
  perpendicular</span> <span m='315220'>to the plane of rotation passing through
  the point S.</span> </p><p><span m='318400'>And this is what we call the
  moment of inertia of a body.</span> </p><p><span m='321070'>Now, we'll see
  that the moment can be expressed in terms</span> <span m='325290'>of other
  physical quantities.</span> </p><p><span m='326950'>As the course develops,
  you'll see</span> <span m='328930'>two or three more fundamental
  relations</span> <span m='331300'>for moment of inertia.</span> </p><p><span
  m='332620'>But what we'd like to do now is summarize our results--</span>
  <span m='335560'>that the kinetic energy of rotation is 1/2 for
  rotation</span> <span m='341380'>about this axis, I'm just to indicate passing
  through S,</span> <span m='344830'>of I s times omega z squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='348890'>Now keep in mind, because omega z is a
  component,</span> <span m='351950'>it can be positive, 0, or negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='353890'>But the square is always a positive definite
  quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='358930'>And that's our kinetic energy of
  rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='362630'>Let's contrast that with our
  translational kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='366610'>And we remember
  there that was 1/2 times the total mass</span> <span m='371800'>of the object
  times v squared cm,</span> <span m='376540'>where we're looking at all of the
  objects</span> <span m='378520'>at the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='380110'>And this is the total mass of the object.</span> </p>
