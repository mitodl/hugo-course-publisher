  <p><span m='3574'>So far in the course, we've been studying the motion</span>
  <span m='5740'>of collections of particles.</span> </p><p><span m='6910'>We
  would know like to consider rigid bodies.</span> </p><p><span m='9810'>Now,
  rigid bodies can be translated in space</span> <span m='15220'>as I move it
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='16480'>Or we can rotate this rigid body
  about some point.</span> </p><p><span m='22250'>I can rotate it about the end
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='26420'>I can rotate it about a point
  which</span> <span m='29440'>we call the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='31540'>So I can rotate it about the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34720'>I can take the rigid body and I can</span> <span m='36970'>rotate it
  about the center of mass,</span> <span m='39070'>and also translate it in
  space.</span> </p><p><span m='41420'>So there's many types of motions that
  we</span> <span m='43120'>can do with rigid bodies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='44710'>Sometimes the motions are quite complicated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='47350'>If I spin it like that, it is a very more complicated motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='52220'>You can see that it's rotating about this axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='56710'>So what we'd like to do now is analyze</span> <span
  m='59170'>how to think about the motion of rigid bodies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='62800'>And what we'd like to do is idealize our rigid body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='66280'>So even though we looked at a rod here,</span> <span
  m='69520'>let's just draw some extended idealized rigid body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='74680'>And let's identify two points in that rigid
  body--</span> <span m='77870'>the j-th point and the k-th point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='81880'>And we'll think of our rigid body</span> <span
  m='84430'>as a bunch of point-like particles mj and mk.</span> </p><p><span
  m='89800'>And the important thing that defines a rigid body</span> <span
  m='93490'>is the condition that the distance-- and we'll</span> <span
  m='97000'>draw a vector from the k-th particle to the j-th particle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='104350'>So we'll draw that as rjk.</span> </p><p><span
  m='109450'>And actually, I'd like to write it from the k-th particle</span>
  <span m='114100'>to the j-th particle rjk.</span> </p><p><span m='117280'>And
  our condition is that the magnitude of this vector, which</span> <span
  m='122720'>I'll denote as rjk is constant for all points j and k.</span>
  </p><p><span m='135560'>Now, what does that mean?</span> </p><p><span
  m='137340'>That means the distance between any two</span> <span
  m='140150'>points in the rigid body stays fixed no matter</span> <span
  m='144890'>how the rigid body is moving and no matter what</span> <span
  m='148060'>two points I choose.</span> </p><p><span m='150590'>The distance
  between any two points is fixed.</span> </p><p><span m='154280'>So we'll
  rewrite this as the distance between any two points</span> <span m='168079'>is
  fixed.</span> </p><p><span m='170720'>So that doesn't change.</span>
  </p><p><span m='172500'>And that's what we call the rigid body
  condition.</span> </p><p></p>
