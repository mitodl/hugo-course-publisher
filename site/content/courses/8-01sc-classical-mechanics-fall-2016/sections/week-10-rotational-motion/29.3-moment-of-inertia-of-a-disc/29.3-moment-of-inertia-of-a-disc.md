title: 29.3 Moment of Inertia of a Disc
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3555'>I would now like to calculate the moment of inertia</span>
  <span m='5680'>for a very thin disk.</span> </p><p><span m='9050'>So we have a
  thin disk.</span> </p><p><span m='11950'>And the radius of that disk is
  r.</span> </p><p><span m='14920'>And it has a mass m.</span> </p><p><span
  m='17270'>And I would like to calculate the moment of inertia</span> <span
  m='19450'>for this disk.</span> </p><p><span m='20830'>Now, let's just remind
  what point</span> <span m='22960'>we're calculating it about, about the center
  of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='26380'>So our definition of moment of
  inertia</span> <span m='28720'>was take a small element, mass element to the
  disk.</span> </p><p><span m='32057'>In fact, we're going to see it doesn't
  have to be small.</span> </p><p><span m='34390'>Take a mass element to the
  disk that's useful,</span> <span m='37390'>and multiply it by the
  perpendicular distance squared</span> <span m='40900'>from the point we're
  calculating it.</span> </p><p><span m='43240'>So the way I'll do it is I will
  choose a ring.</span> </p><p><span m='48940'>I'm gonna choose a ring of radius
  r.</span> </p><p><span m='53860'>And now I'll make the ring a certain
  thickness.</span> </p><p><span m='58180'>And this thickness is dr.</span>
  </p><p><span m='62830'>Now, in this calculation, we're going</span> <span
  m='64930'>to take a limit as dr goes to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='69100'>So
  even though the ring has some finite thickness,</span> <span m='72400'>its
  radius-- we'll eventually treat</span> <span m='74650'>treated as all of the
  mass element</span> <span m='76560'>a distance r from the center.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78700'>So r will be our integration variable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='83170'>And that will be equal to rcm, what we're
  calling</span> <span m='87460'>rcm in the abstract result.</span> </p><p><span
  m='90430'>Now, the dm is the tricky part.</span> </p><p><span m='93140'>So
  what is the mass that's contained in this area disk</span> <span m='100720'>of
  radius r and thickness dr?</span> </p><p><span m='103300'>Well, one way to
  think about that is it's-- here we</span> <span m='107080'>didn't say this,
  but our disk is going to be uniform.</span> </p><p><span m='113380'>And so we
  can describe the mass per unit area</span> <span m='116860'>as the total mass
  divided by the area of the whole disk.</span> </p><p><span m='122920'>And then
  we can say that the mass in that ring</span> <span m='127000'>is equal to
  sigma mass per area times</span> <span m='131890'>the area of the outer ring
  minus the area of the inner ring.</span> </p><p><span m='140470'>Now, when we
  expand this out, dm, m over pi r squared,</span> <span m='146980'>we get pi r
  squared plus 2rdr plus dr quantity</span> <span m='152890'>squared minus pi r
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='156280'>And you can see those terms
  cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='159440'>And so what I get is m times pi r
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='163300'>And in here I have 2 pi r dr.
  Now,</span> <span m='167860'>this is only order dr, plus a second term</span>
  <span m='171760'>that goes like pi dr squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='175300'>And so, when I take this limit as dr goes to 0,</span> <span
  m='180310'>this term is much, much smaller than that term.</span> </p><p><span
  m='183760'>And so I can say my mass element is m pi r squared times</span>
  <span m='188770'>2 pi r dr.</span> </p><p><span m='191740'>Now, let's think
  about this term, why it makes sense.</span> </p><p><span m='195730'>When we're
  shrinking our ring, so taking a limit as dr</span> <span m='202329'>goes to 0,
  and the ring just becomes an extremely thin ring</span> <span m='207100'>at
  radius r, then this piece is a circumference,</span> <span m='213610'>and this
  piece is just the width.</span> </p><p><span m='217700'>And so it's no
  surprise that area is 2 pi r</span> <span m='222040'>times d pi r dr in the
  limit.</span> </p><p><span m='225670'>And now that enables us to write the
  moment of inertia</span> <span m='229990'>about the center of mass,
  icm.</span> </p><p><span m='233950'>Let's pull out these constants, m pi r
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='238301'>Now we're integrating over the
  body.</span> </p><p><span m='239800'>Let's hold off on the limits for the
  moment,</span> <span m='241960'>and put our values for dm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='243370'>That's 2 pi r dr. And we have our distance squared,</span> <span
  m='250610'>which was, again, the radius of r squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='253990'>And so the pis will cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='256160'>I have
  2m over r-squared times the integral of r cubed dr.</span> </p><p><span
  m='262840'>Now, we're supposedly integrating over the body,</span> <span
  m='265420'>but what does that body integral actually mean?</span> </p><p><span
  m='269030'>Well, what we're doing is we're taking a series of rings</span>
  <span m='273820'>and adding them up as we go from the origin</span> <span
  m='278890'>out to the radius of the whole disk.</span> </p><p><span
  m='281620'>So the limits of our body integral with respect</span> <span
  m='284380'>to our integration variable, we start with rings</span> <span
  m='287860'>that essentially have no width.</span> </p><p><span m='291230'>And
  we're integrating these, we're adding up</span> <span m='293500'>the
  contribution of every ring until we</span> <span m='296050'>get to rings of
  radius r.</span> </p><p><span m='298330'>And our integration variable, r
  cubed, dr.</span> </p><p><span m='302080'>Now, this is an integral that's easy
  to do.</span> </p><p><span m='304970'>That's r to the forth over 4 between 0
  and r equals r.</span> </p><p><span m='310930'>And when we put that in, the 2
  cancels the 4.</span> </p><p><span m='314020'>And oh, the pi we lost.</span>
  </p><p><span m='316600'>So let's make sure this pi should be in m.</span>
  </p><p><span m='319900'>So we have the 2 over the 4 is one half, and r
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='326410'>And that is the moment of inertia of
  it</span> <span m='329080'>does about an axis passing through the
  center</span> <span m='332620'>perpendicular to the plane of the disk.</span>
