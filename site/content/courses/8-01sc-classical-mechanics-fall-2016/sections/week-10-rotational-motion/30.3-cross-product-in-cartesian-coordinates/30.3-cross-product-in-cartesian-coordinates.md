title: 30.3 Cross Product in Cartesian Coordinates
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3510'>So when we have a vector product of two vectors,</span>
  <span m='6060'>A cross B equals C, let's compute that vector product</span>
  <span m='11430'>in different coordinate systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='13330'>So let's begin by choosing two vectors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='17190'>I hat, and J hat.</span> </p><p><span m='20730'>And notice they're
  at a right angle,</span> <span m='23020'>and because there is a unit
  vector,</span> <span m='25710'>the area here is equal to and 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='29400'>And I want to define K hat to be equal to I hat cross J
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='37020'>Now, our angle theta here was 90
  degrees.</span> </p><p><span m='41910'>And so, if I use the right hand rule,
  then I hat,</span> <span m='45980'>cross J hat is-- the right handed unit
  normal is out</span> <span m='52440'>of the plane of the figure.</span>
  </p><p><span m='54600'>And so I would write K hat like that,</span> <span
  m='57930'>and notice K hat is out of plane of figure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='64379'>And because I used my right hand rule,</span> <span m='66970'>this
  is what we call a right handed coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='75430'>Now, there's something very nice about this cross product</span>
  <span m='81480'>definition.</span> </p><p><span m='82470'>Notice that there's
  a cyclic order.</span> </p><p><span m='84900'>IJK is a cyclic order.</span>
  </p><p><span m='92259'>And if you interchange any two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='93930'>For example, JIK, that's anti-cyclic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='101250'>And the cross products satisfy this cyclic rule, in that,</span>
  <span m='107610'>J cross K hat is I hat.</span> </p><p><span m='114110'>And
  notice JKI, maintains that cyclic order, and K hat</span> <span
  m='124490'>cross I hat is J hat.</span> </p><p><span m='128503'>KIJ maintains
  that cyclic order, but because of the way</span> <span m='133700'>we defined a
  cross-product in general A cross B</span> <span m='139460'>is minus B cross A,
  because now you're</span> <span m='143150'>using the opposite direction, so
  there's a minus sign.</span> </p><p><span m='149390'>And therefore, any
  anti-cyclic permutation of these unit</span> <span m='153380'>vectors, as an
  example, K hat cross J hat, has to be--</span> <span m='159320'>notice I've--
  is minus I hat-- that's anti-communitive</span> <span m='165620'>property of
  the cross-product.</span> </p><p><span m='167510'>Similarly, I hat cross K hat
  is minus J hat.</span> </p><p><span m='173660'>And lastly, J hat cross I hat
  is minus K hat.</span> </p><p><span m='181070'>And so, in fact, you only need
  to know one.</span> </p><p><span m='185180'>And this idea of cyclic, and
  anti-cyclic,</span> <span m='188750'>to be able to write down all of the other
  6.</span> </p><p><span m='193370'>So we have one, two, three, four, five,
  six.</span> </p><p><span m='196640'>Now, when you want to compute the cross
  products</span> <span m='200360'>in Cartesian coordinates, for
  instance,</span> <span m='202340'>it can be a little bit messy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='205190'>There's going to be a lot of terms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='206780'>If I write a vector A as A X I hat</span> <span
  m='209960'>plus A Y J hat plus A Z K hat.</span> </p><p><span m='216230'>And I
  write a vector B as BX I hat plus BY J hat plus BZ K</span> <span
  m='225335'>hat.</span> </p><p><span m='226270'>And now I want to compute the
  cross-product of these vectors</span> <span m='233300'>to get the new
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='235310'>Notice that there's going to be six terms,
  because I</span> <span m='240500'>have I hat-- well, we actually should say
  one more thing.</span> </p><p><span m='244610'>that I hat cross I hat-- the
  angle between these two vectors</span> <span m='249860'>is zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='251500'>There's no perpendicular projection.</span>
  </p><p><span m='254330'>So that's zero, as is J hat cross J hat, K hat cross K
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='262970'>So of these nine parts, when we take the
  cross-product,</span> <span m='268970'>three of them will be 0, by this
  rule,</span> <span m='272390'>and we'll we apply our cyclic or anti-cyclic
  rules</span> <span m='275030'>for the others.</span> </p><p><span
  m='276840'>And so what we have here-- let's just do it</span> <span
  m='278930'>in-- so C equals A cross B.</span> </p><p><span m='288750'>And now
  let's just go one by one.</span> </p><p><span m='291850'>I hat cross I
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='294490'>That's 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='296380'>There's no perpendicular part.</span> </p><p><span m='298240'>The
  area formed by these two vectors is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='300700'>I hat
  cross J hat.</span> </p><p><span m='303600'>That's cyclic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='305110'>IJ is plus K hat.</span> </p><p><span m='307810'>So our first
  non-zero term is AXBY K hat I hat cross J hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='314800'>And now let's do I hat cross K hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='317950'>Notice that's anti-cyclic.</span> </p><p><span m='319540'>I K minus
  J. So our next term is minus AX BZ J hat.</span> </p><p><span m='328540'>So
  there's the first two.</span> </p><p><span m='330430'>And now let's just
  continue this process.</span> </p><p><span m='332920'>J hat cross I
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='335590'>That's anti-cyclic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='337840'>So we have minus AY BX K hat.</span> </p><p><span m='345670'>AY J
  hat across BX I hat.</span> </p><p><span m='348310'>J hat cross J hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='350200'>That's 0.</span> </p><p><span m='351760'>So we have no
  contribution there.</span> </p><p><span m='353260'>And J hat crossed K hat,
  that is cyclic.</span> </p><p><span m='356650'>So that's plus AY BZ K
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='362650'>And now we have our last two terms K hat
  cross I hat.</span> </p><p><span m='366990'>That cyclic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='367780'>So that's plus AZ BX J hat.</span> </p><p><span m='374870'>K hat
  cross J hat.</span> </p><p><span m='376360'>That's anti-cyclic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='378130'>So there's a minus I hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='379940'>So it's minus AZ BY I hat.</span> </p><p><span m='386520'>And
  finally K hat cross K hat, well that's also 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='390500'>So we have six terms.</span> </p><p><span m='392230'>And we can
  collect them equal to AX BY minus-- well</span> <span m='402015'>let's check
  this one.</span> </p><p><span m='405340'>Here we used the wrong symbol
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='408550'>We have to be a little bit careful
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='411450'>AY cross BZ is J hat cross K hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='415860'>That's plus I hat.</span> </p><p><span m='418870'>So
  we have AXBY minus AY BX K hat.</span> </p><p><span m='427600'>And now let's
  look at the I hat terms.</span> </p><p><span m='430750'>I'll just check those
  off.</span> </p><p><span m='432820'>We have AY BZ minus AZ BY I hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='444050'>And check those two terms off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='446350'>And lastly, we have AZ BX minus AXPZ.</span> </p><p><span
  m='451020'>So we have AZBX minus AX BZ and that's J hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='462120'>And that's how we calculate the cross-product</span> <span
  m='466530'>in Cartesian coordinates.</span> </p><p></p>
