transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4010'>Consider a rod of mass m, and suppose</span> <span
  m='14210'>I apply a force to this rod.</span> </p><p><span m='16900'>Let's say
  a force like that.</span> </p><p><span m='23550'>So we know that as a result
  of that applied force, the center</span> <span m='26730'>of mass of the rod,
  which we can imagine is right at the center</span> <span m='29430'>the rod,
  will translate with some acceleration, such</span> <span m='33270'>that the
  vector f is equal to the mass</span> <span m='38220'>of the rod times the
  acceleration</span> <span m='40470'>of the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='42450'>Now recall that for a rigid body,</span> <span m='44490'>this
  equation will be true regardless of where on the rod</span> <span m='47880'>I
  apply the force.</span> </p><p><span m='49260'>So for example, if I draw the
  rod again over here,</span> <span m='55200'>and I apply the same force, vector
  f, but I apply it,</span> <span m='58620'>let's say, on the right hand
  side,</span> <span m='61380'>I'll still have the same f equals ma.</span>
  </p><p><span m='64260'>All I specify with f is its magnitude and
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='68820'>But for a rigid body, no matter where
  on the body</span> <span m='72390'>I apply that force, the acceleration</span>
  <span m='75930'>of the center of mass will be the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='79030'>Now, we know from experience, however,</span> <span m='81330'>that
  the motion of the rod is different</span> <span m='83670'>if I push it at the
  center at one end or at the other end.</span> </p><p><span m='89270'>The point
  is, though, that the motion, the overall motion,</span> <span m='92430'>the
  overall translation of the object</span> <span m='95310'>doesn't just involve
  the translation</span> <span m='96900'>of the center of mass, but it also
  involves some rotation,</span> <span m='100080'>in general.</span>
  </p><p><span m='101370'>So in fact, there is a theorem called Chasles'
  theorem, which</span> <span m='111360'>tells us that the most general
  displacement of a rigid body</span> <span m='115680'>can be split into the
  translation</span> <span m='118289'>of the center of mass and a rotation about
  the center</span> <span m='121770'>of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='122610'>Our
  f equals ma relation tells us</span> <span m='125430'>how an applied force
  affects the first part of the translation</span> <span m='128478'>of the
  center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='130020'>But how does that applied force
  affect</span> <span m='132300'>the rotation of the rigid body?</span>
  </p><p><span m='134510'>We'll see that this depends not only on the
  magnitude</span> <span m='137820'>and direction of the force, but also on
  where</span> <span m='141030'>the force is applied, OK?</span> </p><p><span
  m='143129'>That's different than the translation</span> <span m='144670'>of
  the center of mass, which only</span> <span m='145740'>depends upon what the
  force is.</span> </p><p><span m='147329'>The rotation about the center of
  mass</span> <span m='149460'>depends both upon the force itself and where on
  the object</span> <span m='153540'>that it's applied.</span> </p><p><span
  m='156570'>In fact, in the next few lessons,</span> <span m='158320'>we'll see
  that there's a special equation of motion</span> <span m='161220'>for
  describing rotational motion.</span> </p><p><span m='162750'>It's analogous to
  Newton's Second Law of Motion,</span> <span m='164790'>analogous to f equals
  ma, applying to rotational motion.</span> </p><p><span m='169079'>And we write
  that relationship.</span> </p><p><span m='173540'>Its rotational equation of
  motion</span> <span m='183470'>is written as tau, which is a vector,</span>
  <span m='186160'>is equal to i times alpha, which is a vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='192150'>So tau is a new quantity we haven't talked</span>
  <span m='198880'>about before called the torque.</span> </p><p><span
  m='202570'>It's a vector.</span> </p><p><span m='205470'>i is the moment of
  inertia that we've already encountered,</span> <span m='215480'>and alpha is
  the angular acceleration</span> <span m='219980'>of the rotational
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='229280'>Now, tau is a sort of rotational analog
  to the force,</span> <span m='233990'>and it depends on not just the force
  itself,</span> <span m='236780'>but on where the force is applied.</span>
  </p><p><span m='239900'>Computing the torque, tau, depends upon
  something</span> <span m='243290'>called a vector product or a cross
  product.</span> </p><p><span m='245580'>It's a way of multiplying two vectors
  together</span> <span m='248600'>to produce a third vector.</span>
  </p><p><span m='250130'>In that way, it's different than the dot product or
  scalar</span> <span m='252740'>product that we discussed earlier,</span> <span
  m='254540'>where we multiply two vectors together and get</span> <span
  m='257329'>a scalar or a pure number.</span> </p><p><span m='259310'>This is a
  different operation, the vector product</span> <span m='261589'>or
  cross-product.</span> </p><p><span m='262910'>Torque is the first physical
  quantity we've encountered,</span> <span m='265490'>but it won't be the last,
  that involves a cross-product</span> <span m='268330'>in its
  definition.</span> </p><p><span m='269420'>And so, before giving you a formal
  definition of torque,</span> <span m='272600'>we'll first review the
  mathematics of cross-products,</span> <span m='275100'>and we'll do that in
  the next lesson.</span> </p><p><span m='278210'>Now, the angular acceleration,
  alpha,</span> <span m='281360'>tells us about how the rotational motion
  changes.</span> </p><p><span m='285770'>Again, just like in f equals ma,
  where</span> <span m='288170'>we could divide the two sides of this
  equation</span> <span m='290970'>into dynamics and kinematics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='293750'>Kinematics is telling us about a geometrical
  description</span> <span m='297830'>of the motion, or the translation of
  motion,</span> <span m='299750'>and the dynamics f is telling us about
  how</span> <span m='304160'>the applied forces cause changes in the motion,
  changes</span> <span m='307130'>in the kinematics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='308690'>Likewise, for rotational motion, the angular acceleration,</span>
  <span m='312380'>alpha, tells us about the geometry</span> <span m='315560'>of
  the rotational motion, and specifically</span> <span m='317450'>how the
  rotational motion is changing,</span> <span m='320360'>and the torque is
  telling us about the application of forces</span> <span m='325160'>and how
  that causes changes in the rotation of motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='329370'>So that leaves one other quantity,</span> <span m='331580'>which is
  the moment of inertia.</span> </p><p><span m='333680'>And I want to talk about
  what that means for just a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='337940'>So the term
  "inertia," the term "inertia" in physics</span> <span m='347570'>represents a
  resistance to an applied force.</span> </p><p><span m='349909'>It tells us how
  difficult it is to change an object's motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='354350'>So for example, suppose I have two blocks, one of mass m</span>
  <span m='360380'>and another that's 10 times as massive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='363830'>So 10m.</span> </p><p><span m='366230'>Newton's Second Law, f
  equals ma,</span> <span m='369170'>tells us that if I want to accelerate the
  heavier</span> <span m='374480'>mass to the same rate that I do with a smaller
  mass,</span> <span m='380870'>I'll need to apply a force that's 10 times
  larger.</span> </p><p><span m='384440'>So for translation of motion, the mass
  m</span> <span m='388490'>represents the notion of inertia, the
  resistance</span> <span m='392630'>to a force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='393560'>It tells us how much force we have</span> <span m='395150'>to apply
  to achieve a certain change in motion.</span> </p><p><span m='398570'>Now, for
  rotational motion, that role</span> <span m='401810'>is played by the moment
  of inertia i.</span> </p><p><span m='405080'>That tells us how difficult it is
  to change</span> <span m='408110'>the rotation of an object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='410100'>If I increase the moment of inertia by a factor of
  10,</span> <span m='415020'>then I'll need a torque that is 10 times larger in
  order</span> <span m='419030'>to achieve the same change in rotational
  motion,</span> <span m='421790'>the same angular acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='424550'>But recall that our definition of moment of
  inertia</span> <span m='429110'>for some rigid body is, if I break up</span>
  <span m='432260'>the rigid body into a bunch of little pieces,</span> <span
  m='434780'>and for each piece I take the product</span> <span m='437840'>of
  the mass of that piece, delta mj, times the perpendicular</span> <span
  m='442610'>distance of that piece from the rotation</span> <span
  m='445340'>axis-- I call that rj-- and if I sum</span> <span m='448520'>that
  over the entire object, the entire body, that</span> <span m='452120'>gives me
  my moment of inertia.</span> </p><p><span m='454050'>Well, so-- sorry, this is
  r squared.</span> </p><p><span m='456710'>So it's the mass of each element
  times the distance</span> <span m='461900'>of the axis squared, delta mj times
  rj squared.</span> </p><p><span m='465860'>Now, I can increase the moment of
  inertia by a factor of 10</span> <span m='469460'>by increasing the total mass
  of the object,</span> <span m='472514'>but you can see from this
  equation</span> <span m='473930'>that I can also do it with the same
  mass</span> <span m='476480'>by changing the location of the mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='478210'>If I increase the r's, if I move the mass, the same
  mass,</span> <span m='485420'>but I move it to be farther away from the
  rotation axis,</span> <span m='488240'>that also achieves an increase in the
  moment of inertia.</span> </p><p><span m='492510'>So what that tells is that
  for rotational motion,</span> <span m='495060'>it's not just the amount of
  mass that matters,</span> <span m='498710'>but also how that mass is
  distributed.</span> </p><p><span m='501766'>OK, so in that sense, rotational
  inertia</span> <span m='504170'>is different than translational
  inertia.</span> </p><p><span m='505970'>For translational motion, all that
  matters is the mass.</span> </p><p><span m='509020'>If I increase the mass by
  a factor of 10,</span> <span m='512070'>then it will become a factor of
  10</span> <span m='513530'>more difficult to get that object to
  accelerate.</span> </p><p><span m='516210'>I need a factor of 10 larger
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='518600'>But with rotational motion, I can</span>
  <span m='522080'>increase the notion of inertia.</span> </p><p><span
  m='523679'>I can make it more difficult to change the rotation of
  motion</span> <span m='526700'>either by changing the mass, by increasing
  it,</span> <span m='528650'>or by making the distribution of mass</span> <span
  m='531260'>be further away from the rotation axis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='534500'>So as an example, imagine if you were rolling a wheel up a
  hill.</span> </p><p><span m='540920'>It's different if I have a wheel whose
  mass is distributed</span> <span m='543980'>evenly over the whole disk, or if
  I have</span> <span m='546590'>all of the mass in the rim.</span> </p><p><span
  m='547940'>If all of the mass is in the rim, then from this equation,</span>
  <span m='551104'>we see the moment of inertia is larger for the same
  amount</span> <span m='553520'>of total mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='554570'>And so it's much more difficult to roll a wheel up the hill</span>
  <span m='558980'>if all of the mass is in the rim than it</span> <span
  m='561410'>is if the mass is distributed evenly over the wheel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='566060'>So our rotational equivalent to Newton's Second
  Law</span> <span m='570080'>is, tau equals i alpha, the torque</span> <span
  m='573410'>equals the moment of inertia times the angular acceleration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='576520'>In the next few lessons, we'll see how torque is
  defined,</span> <span m='579800'>and we'll derive this expression for the
  dynamics of rotation</span> <span m='584730'>of motion and see how to apply
  it.</span> </p>
