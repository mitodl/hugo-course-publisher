title: 31.4 Worked Example - Atwood Machine
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3480'>Let's consider a very famous problem the, Atwood
  machine.</span> </p><p><span m='6920'>We have a pulley, A, suspended from a
  ceiling.</span> </p><p><span m='11780'>And a rope is wrapped around the
  pulley.</span> </p><p><span m='14330'>And on each side of the rope, there's
  different masses.</span> </p><p><span m='18200'>So here is block 1, and block
  2, and we</span> <span m='22820'>can say here-- it doesn't matter--</span>
  <span m='25160'>but we'll say that M2 is bigger than M1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='28040'>And that gives us some intuition that we</span> <span
  m='29840'>expect block 2 to go down and block 1 to go up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='33440'>Now in this problem there is friction</span> <span m='39750'>between
  the rope and the pulley, so the rope is not sliding.</span> </p><p><span
  m='45690'>And what that means is that the pulley will rotate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='48510'>And also the mass of the pulley is not 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='51840'>So these were all assumptions we made way back
  when</span> <span m='54180'>were analyzing Newton's second law,</span> <span
  m='56260'>but now we have to take into effect</span> <span m='58110'>that
  there some rotational inertia to make</span> <span m='60990'>the pulley start
  to have angular acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='64360'>So what we'd like
  to do is to identify our three objects--</span> <span m='68350'>mass 1, the
  pulley, and mass 2.</span> </p><p><span m='70920'>And for mass 1 and mass 2,
  use Newton's second law,</span> <span m='74130'>for the pulley, we'll use our
  torque relationships.</span> </p><p><span m='77260'>So let's begin by drawing
  our free body</span> <span m='79410'>diagrams for object 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='82500'>So we have tension in the rope pulling object 1
  up,</span> <span m='87420'>we have the gravitational force down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='89970'>And here it doesn't matter which way</span> <span
  m='92759'>I'm going to choose my unit vectors, because I</span> <span
  m='95670'>have this idea that M2 is bigger than M1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='98460'>I'm just going to choose j hat 1 up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='101820'>Now for block 2, I have M2g.</span> </p><p><span m='106680'>Now
  here's the place where lots of people get tripped up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='109590'>In the past we've been assuming that the tension in the rope</span>
  <span m='113729'>is uniform everywhere.</span> </p><p><span m='116280'>In this
  problem, because the rope is not slipping</span> <span m='120090'>and the
  pulley is not massless, the tension</span> <span m='123720'>is not constant
  everywhere in the rope.</span> </p><p><span m='127380'>And we'll see more
  reasons why that can't be the case, so I'll</span> <span m='130590'>have to
  identify a different tension on the other side T2</span> <span
  m='134160'>pulling the rope, pulling the block up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='137579'>And I'm going to choose j hat 2 down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='139890'>Notice my unit vectors are chosen in opposite directions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='143920'>The reason for that is that there's a constraint
  here</span> <span m='147840'>that as block 2 goes down, block 1 goes
  up,</span> <span m='151620'>if the acceleration of block 2 is positive,</span>
  <span m='154170'>the acceleration of block 1 will also</span> <span
  m='156120'>be positive if I choose unit vector pointing up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='159760'>So now I can write Newton's second law for both of
  these.</span> </p><p><span m='163360'>So for block 2, positive down, and 2g
  minus T2 equals M2a.</span> </p><p><span m='171690'>It's the same acceleration
  in the rope.</span> </p><p><span m='174390'>a is equal to a1, equal to a2,
  they're all positive.</span> </p><p><span m='178930'>And for 2, notice I have
  positive up</span> <span m='183480'>minus M1g equals m1a.</span> </p><p><span
  m='187740'>So so far, these are my two equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='190260'>I have three unknowns-- T1, T2, and the accelerations,</span> <span
  m='194700'>and only two equations.</span> </p><p><span m='196660'>Now let's
  analyze the pulley.</span> </p><p><span m='198970'>So we have our pulley A.
  And what</span> <span m='201990'>are the forces on the pulley?</span>
  </p><p><span m='204570'>Well forces and torques are a little bit
  different,</span> <span m='207310'>but let's just draw our forces
  first.</span> </p><p><span m='209640'>There is a tension holding it up,</span>
  <span m='211680'>we'll call that T3 from this rope pulling it up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='215710'>Now here's where we have to be careful.</span>
  </p><p><span m='219390'>Rope 1 is pulling the pulley down, that's what we
  called T1,</span> <span m='224970'>so we draw a T1 on this side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='227220'>And the same rope on the other side</span> <span
  m='229410'>is pulling the pulley down.</span> </p><p><span m='231000'>Notice
  that it is a different, T2.</span> </p><p><span m='234840'>Now this brings us
  to what we called our rotational</span> <span m='238740'>coordinate
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='240750'>I do know expect that the
  angular</span> <span m='244440'>acceleration of the pulley.</span>
  </p><p><span m='246690'>So as the pulley rotates in this problem,</span> <span
  m='249930'>I expect that it's rotating in the direction</span> <span
  m='254100'>like by the right hand rule, this way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='258899'>And so I expect to see the alpha pointing like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='268350'>What I'll do is I'll choose a coordinate system for an
  angle</span> <span m='273659'>theta.</span> </p><p><span m='275409'>And that
  will make positive direction</span> <span m='279490'>like that for my
  rotational coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='283180'>Now when we write
  torque equals the moment of inertia</span> <span m='288450'>of the pulley,
  times the angular acceleration,</span> <span m='292500'>we have two
  torques.</span> </p><p><span m='294360'>The radius is R, radiuses of R. And if
  we're</span> <span m='300630'>calculating the torque about the center of the
  pulley,</span> <span m='304050'>we'll call that point 0, then each of these
  torques</span> <span m='308220'>are in different directions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='310180'>So for instance, we would have to take for T1</span>
  <span m='313560'>going down and this vector from origin to where T1 is
  acting,</span> <span m='320190'>we can extend that force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='323910'>And we see that that torque is pointing in the direction</span>
  <span m='329370'>in-- direction like that.</span> </p><p><span m='332940'>And
  that's opposite or sign here.</span> </p><p><span m='335190'>So this torque,
  minus T1 R is negative.</span> </p><p><span m='339640'>What about the torque
  from the other force, T2?</span> </p><p><span m='343470'>Again, we would draw
  that vector.</span> </p><p><span m='345659'>Let's draw them over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='347490'>We have T2 pointing down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='349890'>The point 0 is there.</span> </p><p><span m='352400'>The vector
  from 0 to 2 is pointing like that.</span> </p><p><span m='358540'>We extend
  that vector.</span> </p><p><span m='360150'>We put the arrow like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='362140'>And we see that this one is pointing</span> <span
  m='366540'>in our positive direction.</span> </p><p><span m='368080'>So we
  have a plus T2R equals IA alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='374130'>Now right away
  we can see why the tension in the strings</span> <span m='377250'>is not the
  same.</span> </p><p><span m='378734'>Because if these tensions were the
  same,</span> <span m='380400'>this quantity would be 0, but the
  tensions</span> <span m='382740'>can't be the same because the pulley is
  rotating.</span> </p><p><span m='387420'>And that rotational inertia of the
  pulley</span> <span m='390360'>is coming from the fact that the two torques
  are not</span> <span m='393210'>the same on both sides.</span> </p><p><span
  m='395010'>So we now have our last equation here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='397530'>T2R minus T1R equals IA alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='404190'>But
  notice that I've introduced another variable here,</span> <span m='408540'>so
  I guess again, I have four equations and only</span> <span m='410820'>three
  unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='412450'>We still have one last
  constraint.</span> </p><p><span m='415290'>Because the rope is sliding along
  the pulley</span> <span m='418440'>and the radius is R, we know that a
  point</span> <span m='421680'>on the rim of the pulley has acceleration A of
  the rope.</span> </p><p><span m='427900'>But the pulley has an alpha angular
  acceleration,</span> <span m='431220'>so our constraint conditioned here is
  plus R alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='435480'>Now why did I put a plus
  sign?</span> </p><p><span m='438180'>Because when the pulley is rotating the
  direction shown,</span> <span m='441510'>alpha will be positive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='442800'>This quantity, torque, will be bigger than this
  one,</span> <span m='445670'>and so we'll have a positive alpha.</span>
  </p><p><span m='447930'>When I chose j hat 1 up and j hat 2 down,</span> <span
  m='452040'>that made all my accelerations positive,</span> <span
  m='454810'>and so I with the plus side.</span> </p><p><span m='457330'>If I
  had reversed my choice of unit vectors,</span> <span m='460930'>then this
  would be a minus sign.</span> </p><p><span m='463600'>So you have to be
  extremely careful by making sure</span> <span m='467430'>that the directions
  you chose for the linear force</span> <span m='470520'>diagrams that give us
  A, and the direction we chose</span> <span m='473652'>in our rotational
  coordinate system</span> <span m='475110'>are consistent when we choose to
  relate</span> <span m='478260'>the constraints between them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='479980'>So that's our last condition that a equals our R
  alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='486150'>So I now have four equations and four
  unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='488920'>And if I want to solve for the
  acceleration a,</span> <span m='491160'>then I have to need a strategy
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='494650'>And what I'll do to find a is I'll use
  this equation</span> <span m='498570'>as my backbone.</span> </p><p><span
  m='499950'>Why did I do that?</span> </p><p><span m='501210'>Because I have
  the unknowns T2, T1, and alpha.</span> </p><p><span m='505080'>And I have
  separate equations that relate alpha to A,</span> <span m='507735'>and T1 to a
  and T2 to a And so I can solve for T2.</span> </p><p><span m='513440'>And
  substitution here I'll need a little room.</span> </p><p><span m='516480'>So I
  get that T2 is M2g plus M2a.</span> </p><p><span m='525960'>I'm sorry, minus
  M2a times R. Now T1 is M1a plus M1g times R,</span> <span m='544260'>and
  that's equal to times AI alpha, which is a over R.</span> </p><p><span
  m='552000'>So I'll now collect all of my a terms over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='556560'>And so I get to M2gR minus M1gR, this term and this
  term,</span> <span m='570360'>is equal to a times IA over R. Notice</span>
  <span m='576870'>I have 2 plus signs here, so I get M1 plus M2 times R.</span>
  </p><p><span m='585720'>And I therefore conclude, we'll put it over
  here,</span> <span m='590520'>that the acceleration a of is equal to M2 minus
  m1gR, divided</span> <span m='603440'>by IA over R, plus M1 plus M2R.</span>
  </p><p><span m='614540'>Now, when I have this result, let's just</span> <span
  m='616820'>check a number of things first.</span> </p><p><span
  m='619040'>Notice that if M2 is bigger than M1,</span> <span m='621420'>a will
  be positive, which is what I expected.</span> </p><p><span
  m='625810'>Dimensionally, we have M2gR, down here, M2R,</span> <span
  m='632060'>so this first term will have dimensions of acceleration g.</span>
  </p><p><span m='636380'>Now over here, we have IA over R,</span> <span
  m='638840'>but remember moment of inertia is M times R</span> <span
  m='641210'>square, so this also have the dimensions of mass and radius.</span>
  </p><p><span m='646760'>And so I have confidence dimensionally.</span>
  </p><p><span m='650660'>And the sine of A that this is the correct
  answer.</span> </p><p><span m='654780'>And that's how we solve the Atwood
  machine.</span> </p>
