transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3777'>We would now like to compare the moment of inertia</span>
  <span m='5860'>for a rigid body.</span> </p><p><span m='6820'>Let's take an
  arbitrary rigid body about the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='11950'>So let's say the rigid body is rotating about this axis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='16770'>And what we'd like to compare that is</span> <span
  m='18940'>to the moment of inertia, say, about a parallel axis that's</span>
  <span m='22990'>also going through the rigid body.</span> </p><p><span
  m='25270'>Now, let's recall how we define moment of inertia.</span>
  </p><p><span m='28720'>We first choose a mass element dm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='31750'>What I'd like to show is if this object</span> <span m='33670'>is
  rotating about this axis, then what is that object doing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='37990'>Well, that object is undergoing a little bit</span> <span
  m='40150'>of circular motion.</span> </p><p><span m='41650'>And this distance
  here is what we call the perpendicular</span> <span m='45940'>distance about
  that axis.</span> </p><p><span m='49250'>And let's indicate this is for our
  element dm.</span> </p><p><span m='53590'>So this perpendicular distance
  is</span> <span m='56260'>what shows up in our definition for the center of
  mass moment</span> <span m='60580'>of inertia about that axis-- it's the
  interval of dm r cm</span> <span m='65980'>perp.</span> </p><p><span
  m='67030'>Now again, quantity squared.</span> </p><p><span m='69594'>What is
  this distance?</span> </p><p><span m='70510'>This is the perpendicular
  distance from our dm</span> <span m='73570'>and to the axis of
  rotation.</span> </p><p><span m='75850'>Imagine it's doing a circle and
  that's</span> <span m='78160'>the radius of that circle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='80480'>So if we were to calculate the moment of inertia</span> <span
  m='83230'>about another axis, then about this</span> <span m='86860'>axis the
  perpendicular distance here</span> <span m='91430'>that I'll write as rs
  perp.</span> </p><p><span m='95332'>And you can see these perpendicular
  distances are not</span> <span m='97539'>the same.</span> </p><p><span
  m='98660'>And the moment of inertia about that</span> <span m='100390'>other
  axis is equal to the integral of dm rs perp quantity</span> <span
  m='108190'>squared.</span> </p><p><span m='109700'>Now, how do we relate those
  perpendicular distances?</span> </p><p><span m='114759'>Well, there's a couple
  of ways to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='116830'>And notice that the distance
  between these axes</span> <span m='121420'>is given by d.</span> </p><p><span
  m='123460'>And I'm going to call this the distance r cm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='128560'>Now, let's just call this-- the x direction-- I'll call that
  x.</span> </p><p><span m='135780'>So how do I relate these distances?</span>
  </p><p><span m='139980'>Well, d is a fixed distance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='145960'>And you can see from my diagram that rs perp</span> <span
  m='149990'>is equal to d plus r cm x.</span> </p><p><span m='155280'>And if I
  square this, I get d-squared plus 2d rcm x</span> <span m='164310'>plus rcm
  x-squared.</span> </p><p><span m='168390'>And that r cm x-squared is precisely
  what we're</span> <span m='171990'>calling perpendicular distance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='176800'>So when I put those into my moment of inertia
  Is,</span> <span m='181290'>I get dm times d-squared plus 2d times rcm x plus,
  parentheses,</span> <span m='196079'>rcm perp squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='200340'>Now, I'll separate this into three terms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='203170'>The first term is dm times d-squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='207120'>This is an integral over the body.</span> </p><p><span
  m='209950'>The second term is 2d-- and I'm going</span> <span m='214260'>to
  hold off on the interval, because the 2d is</span> <span m='216240'>the same
  for every piece-- dm rcm x.</span> </p><p><span m='221490'>And the third piece
  is integral over the body of dm</span> <span m='229876'>r-- since rcm x is the
  r perp, I'll</span> <span m='234880'>write it as r perp squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='237600'>And you can see that this term is precisely</span>
  <span m='240690'>the moment of inertia about the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='243930'>Now, what I'd like to focus on is</span> <span
  m='246000'>this terribly, in particular, dm rcm</span> <span m='251280'>x that
  appears in our integral expression.</span> </p><p><span m='254280'>Recall,
  that we define center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='256740'>We had the
  condition that the sum of mj rcmj was 0.</span> </p><p><span m='264330'>Now
  for an integral relationship,</span> <span m='267120'>this is dm rcmj cm equal
  to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='274170'>So when you sum up the position of every
  object with respect</span> <span m='277409'>to the vector from the center of
  mass to your dm element, 0.</span> </p><p><span m='281590'>What does this say
  in terms of components?</span> </p><p><span m='284220'>In terms of components,
  each component</span> <span m='287040'>separately vanishes so we have the
  condition that cm x is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='291780'>So that term is 0,
  which is precisely this term-- that's 0.</span> </p><p><span m='297530'>And so
  we can conclude that Is-- now</span> <span m='301710'>in this term, where d is
  the same piece for every object--</span> <span m='306460'>so we're just
  pulling out the total mass.</span> </p><p><span m='309130'>So it's m total
  d-squared.</span> </p><p><span m='312250'>And let's remind ourselves that
  d</span> <span m='314880'>is the distance between the two parallel axes</span>
  <span m='317760'>plus the moment of inertia about the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='322710'>And this result is called the parallel axis
  theorem.</span> </p><p></p>
