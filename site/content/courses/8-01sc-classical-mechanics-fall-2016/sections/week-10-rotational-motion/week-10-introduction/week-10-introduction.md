transcript: >-
  <p><span m='690'>Up until now, we have been studying the motion</span> <span
  m='3120'>of point-like objects.</span> </p><p><span m='5460'>In this module,
  we are going to consider</span> <span m='7440'>the motion of extended objects,
  specifically</span> <span m='10200'>objects that are rigid bodies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='12330'>By rigid, we mean that the distance</span> <span
  m='14340'>between any two points on the object always stays the same.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18070'>In other words, the shape of a rigid body</span> <span
  m='20280'>does not change or deform.</span> </p><p><span m='23820'>There is a
  useful relation known as Chasles' theorem that</span> <span m='27030'>states
  that the general arbitrarily</span> <span m='29130'>complicated displacement
  of a rigid body</span> <span m='31740'>can be broken up into two parts--
  first,</span> <span m='34680'>the translational motion of its center of
  mass,</span> <span m='37470'>and second, the pure rotation of the
  object</span> <span m='40230'>about its center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='42810'>We already know how to analyze the center</span> <span m='44970'>of
  mass translational motion through our study</span> <span m='47160'>of
  point-like objects.</span> </p><p><span m='49170'>This week, we will consider
  the rotational motion</span> <span m='52020'>of rigid bodies, once again
  distinguishing</span> <span m='54510'>between kinematics, a geometric
  description of the motion,</span> <span m='58200'>and dynamics, the underlying
  cause of changes</span> <span m='60900'>in the rotational motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='63270'>On a microscopic level, we can think of an extended
  rigid body</span> <span m='67110'>as made up of a very large number</span>
  <span m='69000'>of small point-like pieces all attached together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='73140'>For rotation about a fixed axis through the center of
  mass,</span> <span m='76740'>each little piece will move in a circle</span>
  <span m='78750'>about the rotational axis.</span> </p><p><span m='81030'>The
  radius of the circle will vary</span> <span m='82680'>depending upon where in
  the object,</span> <span m='84580'>that particular piece sits.</span>
  </p><p><span m='86520'>However, because all of these small pieces</span> <span
  m='88890'>are moving collectively as part of a single rigid body,</span> <span
  m='92280'>they will all have the same angular velocity and angular</span>
  <span m='95340'>acceleration at any given instant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='98610'>This gives us a way to specify the kinematics or geometrical</span>
  <span m='101700'>description of rotational motion using</span> <span
  m='104130'>the vector quantities of angular velocity and angular</span> <span
  m='107220'>acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='109200'>We will also consider
  the dynamics of rotational motion.</span> </p><p><span m='112470'>We will see
  that an applied external force</span> <span m='115140'>is able to change the
  rotational motion of a rigid body,</span> <span m='118440'>depending upon
  exactly where on the body the force is applied.</span> </p><p><span
  m='122700'>This leads directly to the concept of torque,</span> <span
  m='125520'>a vector quantity that represents</span> <span m='127230'>a sort of
  rotational force.</span> </p><p><span m='130169'>Finally, we will see that we
  can link the kinematics</span> <span m='132930'>and dynamics of rotational
  motion</span> <span m='134880'>through a rotational equation of motion,
  analogous to the role</span> <span m='138420'>that Newton's second law plays
  for translational motion.</span> </p><p><span m='141930'>This relation states
  that the angular acceleration</span> <span m='144720'>is proportional to the
  applied torque</span> <span m='146990'>and also depends upon how the mass of
  the object</span> <span m='149670'>is distributed.</span> </p>
