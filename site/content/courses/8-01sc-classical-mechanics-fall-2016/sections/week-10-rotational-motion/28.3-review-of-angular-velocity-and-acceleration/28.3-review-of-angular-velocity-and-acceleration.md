title: 28.3 Review of Angular Velocity and Acceleration
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3670'>Suppose we have a rigid body, and it's</span> <span
  m='6340'>rotating about a fixed axis, and we</span> <span m='9220'>know that
  the angular acceleration, alpha, is given.</span> </p><p><span m='13450'>Now,
  it may be a function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='15490'>And we'd like to
  find from the angular velocity</span> <span m='18220'>and how much angle has
  rotated in some time interval.</span> </p><p><span m='21710'>So the first
  thing we have to do is</span> <span m='23770'>choose a point in the rigid
  body,</span> <span m='26410'>and introduce a coordinate system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='28780'>Here we have our angle theta.</span> </p><p><span
  m='31240'>And with this point, we have our r hat and our theta hat</span>
  <span m='35060'>direction.</span> </p><p><span m='36470'>And recall that by
  the right-hand rule,</span> <span m='38460'>the k hat is going out of the
  plane of the figure.</span> </p><p><span m='44200'>And so we have our
  coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='46300'>And we wrote alpha as the
  second derivative of theta</span> <span m='51940'>with respect to time k
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='53950'>Now our goal is to find omega, which</span>
  <span m='59110'>we'll right as the first derivative of d theta dt k
  hat,</span> <span m='65170'>and also to find theta as a function of
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='69590'>Now recall that our notation was that
  alpha z was the omega</span> <span m='75920'>z dt equals d squared theta dt
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='80630'>And in this notation, omega z was equal
  to d theta dt.</span> </p><p><span m='85852'>Now what we're going to do is
  we're</span> <span m='87310'>going to integrate alpha, just like we</span>
  <span m='89710'>did in simple circular motion kinematics</span> <span
  m='94120'>for point-like objects.</span> </p><p><span m='96039'>And so what we
  have here is that for some time interval,</span> <span m='99370'>omega z at
  time t minus omega z0 is the integral of t</span> <span m='106479'>prime
  equals 0 to t of alpha z, which</span> <span m='111340'>is our component of
  the angular acceleration.</span> </p><p><span m='114970'>We have an
  integration variable, dt prime.</span> </p><p><span m='118420'>And recall that
  that implies that omega z t can</span> <span m='122710'>have some initial
  value at time t</span> <span m='125080'>equals 0 plus this integral
  relationship,</span> <span m='129400'>which is what we want to figure out by
  direct integration.</span> </p><p><span m='134350'>Now, this only works when
  alpha z is some function of time.</span> </p><p><span m='139480'>In order to
  get the angle, theta of t, we integrate again,</span> <span m='144490'>where
  we have theta t0 is the integral from t</span> <span m='148180'>prime equal 0
  to t prime equals t of this function omega z.</span> </p><p><span
  m='153820'>Again, we have some integration variable, t prime, dt prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='159260'>And so we see that theta t can have</span> <span
  m='162850'>some initial value plus this integral relationship,</span> <span
  m='167829'>t prime equals t of omega z t prime dt prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m='174610'>And this is how we can figure out</span> <span m='177360'>how the
  point p has a component of angular velocity,</span> <span m='183180'>and what
  angle the point p sweeps out</span> <span m='187130'>in some time interval
  t.</span> </p><p></p>
