transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4210'>We would now like to look at two-dimensional
  collisions.</span> </p><p><span m='8770'>And what we'd like to look at is in
  the laboratory frame--</span> <span m='12310'>so I'll call that the lab
  frame-- in which we have</span> <span m='14710'>a target particle, which I'm
  going to call 2,</span> <span m='17370'>and an incoming particle 1, which is
  coming in</span> <span m='20710'>with some initial velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='23800'>After the collision, let's imagine</span> <span
  m='25960'>that the target particle is going out</span> <span m='29700'>at a
  certain direction.</span> </p><p><span m='30980'>So we'll call that 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='33570'>And the target particle has a velocity v2 final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='37450'>And the initial particle that's going in this
  direction-- we'll</span> <span m='41530'>call that 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='42730'>And that is it's outcoming velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='46390'>Now in this collision, we want to ask ourselves first,</span> <span
  m='49930'>what quantities are constants of the motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='52420'>Well, let's assume no external forces,</span> <span
  m='55000'>therefore momentum is constant.</span> </p><p><span m='56890'>And we
  can write our momentum equation</span> <span m='58750'>as m1 v1 initial equals
  m1 v1 final plus m2 v2 final.</span> </p><p><span m='70480'>Now recall that
  momentum is a vector.</span> </p><p><span m='72700'>And so what we have here
  are two-- the unknowns here</span> <span m='80230'>are our two outcoming
  vectors, v1 final and v2 final.</span> </p><p><span m='85840'>And a vector in
  two dimensions has two quantities.</span> </p><p><span m='89380'>We can
  discuss-- we can write that as components.</span> </p><p><span m='92770'>Or we
  can write it in terms of magnitudes and directions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='96289'>Now experimentally, we often will measure the directions</span>
  <span m='100360'>of the outcoming particles, which</span> <span m='102280'>I
  will now indicate by theta 2 final and theta 1 final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='108970'>And so, when we write our two momentum equations,</span> <span
  m='111789'>we can either write it as components,</span> <span m='114190'>or we
  can write it in terms of magnitudes and directions</span> <span m='118660'>and
  do vector decomposition.</span> </p><p><span m='120740'>Now because we measure
  the outcoming directions,</span> <span m='123430'>we're going to choose to do
  magnitudes and directions.</span> </p><p><span m='126260'>So let's indicate a
  little notation.</span> </p><p><span m='128090'>We'll say that the magnitude
  of v1 initial is v1 i.</span> </p><p><span m='134800'>And the magnitude of v2
  final is v2 final.</span> </p><p><span m='141550'>And the magnitude of v1
  final is v1 final.</span> </p><p><span m='146380'>And so now, when we look at
  our two momentum conditions,</span> <span m='150690'>we can-- we now also have
  to introduce</span> <span m='153940'>unit vectors for directions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155530'>So let's call i hat that way and j hat in this
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='160990'>And in our i hat direction, we
  have</span> <span m='163570'>only the incoming momentum.</span> </p><p><span
  m='166070'>And we can write that as m1 v1 initial.</span> </p><p><span
  m='170470'>It's positive because we've chosen the forward direction</span>
  <span m='174430'>as our i hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='176360'>Now in
  terms of the outgoing momentum in the i hat</span> <span m='179950'>direction,
  we have to do vector decomposition</span> <span m='182890'>of both of these
  vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='184150'>And they both have positive
  components.</span> </p><p><span m='186800'>So we have m1 v1 final-- that's the
  magnitude-- cosine theta</span> <span m='192690'>1 final plus-- positive sign,
  because they're</span> <span m='196030'>both in the positive direction-- v2
  final magnitude</span> <span m='200010'>times-- we need that little-- m2 v2
  final cosine theta 2 final.</span> </p><p><span m='208870'>And that is our i
  hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='210760'>Now the j hat direction--
  remember,</span> <span m='212920'>we have to be careful, because we're taking
  positive j hat up.</span> </p><p><span m='216340'>So our particle 2 has a
  positive component in the j direction.</span> </p><p><span m='220420'>And our
  particle 1 has a negative component</span> <span m='222700'>in the j
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='224020'>The incoming momentum-- there's no
  momentum in the j direction.</span> </p><p><span m='227329'>So we have a
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='228970'>And that's equal to positive m2 v2
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='235000'>And that's a sine theta 2 final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='238462'>Now, here's where you have to be careful,</span> <span
  m='240170'>because this one is negative.</span> </p><p><span
  m='242350'>Component is in the negative j hat direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='246080'>And we have m1 v1 final sine theta 1 final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='251710'>And these two represent our momentum equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='256040'>Now we also have to think-- let's think about energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='260110'>Again, we have to know something about this
  collision.</span> </p><p><span m='262420'>And our assumption will be that this
  particular collision</span> <span m='266320'>is elastic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='267730'>And that means the initial kinetic energy</span> <span
  m='269770'>is equal to the final kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='272480'>Energy is a scalar.</span> </p><p><span m='273909'>We've been
  describing our incoming velocity vectors</span> <span m='277090'>in terms of
  magnitudes.</span> </p><p><span m='278780'>So we can write our elastic energy
  condition</span> <span m='281620'>as the incoming kinetic energy
  squared--</span> <span m='286000'>that's the kinetic energy incoming--</span>
  <span m='288250'>is equal to 1/2 m1 v1 final squared plus 1/2</span> <span
  m='295470'>m2 v2 final squared.</span> </p><p><span m='299570'>And that is our
  kinetic energy condition.</span> </p><p><span m='303010'>Let's label this
  equation 1 and equation 2.</span> </p><p><span m='307100'>Now, it's very
  important to realize</span> <span m='309350'>which quantities are given and
  which we need to solve for.</span> </p><p><span m='313370'>So in this problem,
  because the two outcoming velocities--</span> <span m='316640'>unknowns-- we
  have four unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='321560'>Those unknowns can be
  written in terms of the two velocity</span> <span m='325790'>final and the
  other one, v2 final.</span> </p><p><span m='332450'>Those are our vector
  quantities.</span> </p><p><span m='334909'>But recall, in terms of the scalar
  magnitudes,</span> <span m='339200'>we have that v1 final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='340820'>And I'll just write the other ones down-- v2 final,</span> <span
  m='343940'>and the two outgoing directions-- theta 1 final</span> <span
  m='347810'>and theta 2 final.</span> </p><p><span m='350240'>So these are our
  four unknown quantities.</span> </p><p><span m='354110'>But you can see we
  only have three equations.</span> </p><p><span m='357230'>And therefore, if we
  want to determine the outcomes,</span> <span m='361190'>we need to measure one
  additional quantity.</span> </p><p><span m='370280'>Now that's very useful
  when doing problem solving,</span> <span m='373280'>because when you start to
  read a problem,</span> <span m='375290'>and you look at what's being
  measured,</span> <span m='377330'>you can right away determine which of the
  four quantities</span> <span m='381200'>has been given.</span> </p><p><span
  m='381890'>You may be given an outgoing magnitude of the velocity,</span>
  <span m='386330'>or you may be given one of these scattering angles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='389480'>And so that's how we approach two-dimensional
  elastic</span> <span m='392420'>collision.</span> </p><p><span m='393440'>Of
  course there's algebra now to solve</span> <span m='395587'>for any particular
  quantity that you're interested</span> <span m='397670'>in, provided you have
  this extra additional information.</span> </p>
