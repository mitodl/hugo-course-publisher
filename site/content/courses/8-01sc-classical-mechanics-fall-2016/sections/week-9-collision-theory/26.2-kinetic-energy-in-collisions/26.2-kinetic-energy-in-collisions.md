title: 26.2 Kinetic Energy in Collisions
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3430'>So we analyzed our one-dimensional collision</span> <span
  m='5530'>where we had an object 1 moving with some initial velocity,</span>
  <span m='9670'>object 2 also moving with some initial velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='13740'>And after the collision, we just arbitrarily</span>
  <span m='16570'>said object 1 is moving this way and object 2</span> <span
  m='19840'>was moving that way.</span> </p><p><span m='22250'>And we called
  that our i hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='25620'>In this collision, we
  assume that it</span> <span m='27280'>was a frictionless surface.</span>
  </p><p><span m='30460'>And there were no external forces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='32080'>So momentum is constant.</span> </p><p><span m='33730'>Now what
  about energy?</span> </p><p><span m='36100'>Well, we know that if there is no
  external forces, then</span> <span m='42310'>in principle there could be no
  external work.</span> </p><p><span m='46790'>However, during the collision,
  we've</span> <span m='49300'>established different types of collisions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='51640'>We said elastic collision is when</span> <span
  m='56980'>we are assuming that the kinetic energy of the system--
  that's</span> <span m='63670'>K system final minus K system initial--</span>
  <span m='70360'>is 0, the statement that the kinetic energy is
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='74620'>We have an inelastic collision in
  which</span> <span m='82560'>delta K system has decreased.</span> </p><p><span
  m='86460'>And that can come from some deformation of the objects</span> <span
  m='88896'>during the collision.</span> </p><p><span m='89770'>Heat is
  generated.</span> </p><p><span m='90660'>Some sound, some other source of
  energy</span> <span m='93560'>in which energy is always constant,</span> <span
  m='97170'>but the kinetic energy of the system could diminish.</span>
  </p><p><span m='101170'>And we also talked about a super elastic
  collision.</span> </p><p><span m='106289'>And in this type of collision, the
  kinetic energy</span> <span m='109080'>of the system has increased.</span>
  </p><p><span m='112390'>Now that's a little bit tricky in terms of what</span>
  <span m='114720'>we're calling our system.</span> </p><p><span m='116160'>But
  imagine that when these two objects collided,</span> <span m='119280'>there
  was some type of chemicals on it that exploded.</span> </p><p><span
  m='122250'>And so that was some chemical energy</span> <span m='124380'>that
  was converted into extra kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='128710'>So in
  order to make a model of our problem,</span> <span m='132360'>we have to
  beforehand make some assumptions about the nature</span> <span m='135780'>of
  the collision.</span> </p><p><span m='137020'>Now for our particular
  collision,</span> <span m='138960'>let's assume that the collision is
  elastic.</span> </p><p><span m='142540'>So we have two conservation
  principles.</span> </p><p><span m='144630'>We have that the kinetic energy of
  the system is constant.</span> </p><p><span m='147780'>And we've already said
  that because there's</span> <span m='149700'>no external forces, the momentum
  of the system is constant.</span> </p><p><span m='153270'>So now we can write
  down our kinetic energy condition.</span> </p><p><span m='157650'>We have m1
  V1-- now here, this can be a little bit tricky</span> <span m='163462'>how
  we're going to write this, because remember</span> <span m='165420'>kinetic
  energy is a magnitude squared</span> <span m='170220'>plus 1/2 m2 V2 initial
  squared equals 1/2 m1 V1 final squared</span> <span m='180360'>plus 1/2 m2 V2
  final squared.</span> </p><p><span m='186040'>Now because a component,
  although it</span> <span m='189810'>can be positive or negative, in one
  dimension,</span> <span m='192900'>if you square the component, you get the
  magnitude.</span> </p><p><span m='196170'>So I can also write this
  equation--</span> <span m='198300'>and I'm going to divide through by the
  halves,</span> <span m='201390'>cancel all those-- as 1x initial squared equal
  to the magnitude</span> <span m='207750'>squared plus m2 V2x initial squared
  equals M1</span> <span m='216400'>V1x final squared plus 1/2 m2 V2x final
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='231750'>And we've already canceled all the
  halves,</span> <span m='234500'>so we have no half there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='237230'>Now given this equation-- we'll call this equation</span> <span
  m='242210'>1-- we can also had our momentum equation,</span> <span
  m='248780'>which I'm going to write down as 2, m1 Vx</span> <span
  m='253640'>initial plus m2 V2x initial equals m1 V1x final plus m2 V2x</span>
  <span m='265790'>final, reminding us of our condition</span> <span
  m='268460'>of the constancy of momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='270350'>So
  now, if you look at this, if we're given the masses, all</span> <span
  m='275570'>the mi's and we're also given the initial state</span> <span
  m='280880'>of the system, V2x initial, then we</span> <span m='285950'>have
  two equations and two unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='287940'>And we can
  solve algebraically for V1x final and V2x final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='297740'>And by determining the signs of these components,</span> <span
  m='301320'>we can figure out the actual final state of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='304850'>So this is going to end up involving a quadratic
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m='310070'>And what we'd like to do now is show
  an alternative way</span> <span m='313760'>that gives us another kind of
  conservation, another principle</span> <span m='318800'>to analyze these one
  dimensional collisions.</span> </p><p><span m='321410'>So we'll begin
  that.</span> </p>
