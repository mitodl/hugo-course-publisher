  <p><span m='3410'>Let's consider a collision in a lab frame</span> <span
  m='6640'>in which one particle is coming in</span> <span m='8620'>and the
  other particle is at rest.</span> </p><p><span m='10960'>So here's particle
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='12710'>V2 initial is 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='14890'>And we could say that m2 is twice m1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='19210'>And this is our lab frame.</span> </p><p><span m='21850'>And now
  let's consider the same collision</span> <span m='24700'>in the center of mass
  frame.</span> </p><p><span m='32280'>And in that reference frame, we
  have</span> <span m='35590'>particle 1 moving with velocity V1 prime
  initial</span> <span m='43150'>and particle 2 moving with velocity V2 initial
  prime.</span> </p><p><span m='50260'>Now, the way we're going to analyze this
  problem</span> <span m='52990'>is that we know the speeds in the center of
  mass frame</span> <span m='59740'>relative to the lab frame.</span>
  </p><p><span m='62870'>So we actually know these initial speeds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='66340'>And we'll write that result down in a moment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='69039'>Because we know the initial speeds,</span> <span
  m='70570'>we also know that V1 final in the center of mass frame</span> <span
  m='77289'>is just minus the initial velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='83234'>That's the beauty of the center of mass frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='85150'>The velocities just change direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='86800'>They don't change magnitude.</span> </p><p><span m='88330'>Because
  we know this we can get V1 final.</span> </p><p><span m='92350'>And then it's
  just a simple exercise</span> <span m='94630'>to go back to the lab frame to
  calculate</span> <span m='99430'>the quantity, the velocity of the object 1 in
  the lab frame.</span> </p><p><span m='104080'>So that will be our sequence of
  ideas.</span> </p><p><span m='106390'>And the key fact that we know is that V1
  prime</span> <span m='115150'>is equal initially to the reduced mass
  divided</span> <span m='121480'>by m1 times V1, 2, where V1, 2 initial</span>
  <span m='133530'>is just equal to V1 initial minus 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='138390'>So that's V1 initial.</span> </p><p><span m='143579'>And the ratio,
  mu over m1, it's very simple to calculate that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='152370'>That's just m2 over m1 plus m2, or our case, that's 2/3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='159690'>And so from our result, we now have very simply</span>
  <span m='166430'>that V1 final prime is minus V1 initial prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='173880'>So it's minus 2/3 V1 initial.</span> </p><p><span
  m='180000'>And that's a very straightforward calculation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='183780'>We can do exactly the same thing with V2 final prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='191350'>V2 final prime is minus V2 initial prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='201180'>And V2 initial prime is equal to minus mu over m2
  times V1, 2</span> <span m='213120'>initial.</span> </p><p><span
  m='214460'>This ratio instead of being 2/3, it's a simple exercise.</span>
  </p><p><span m='217710'>It will be m1 over m1 plus m2 is 1/3 V1
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='225390'>And so we have solved for the final
  velocities in the center</span> <span m='233280'>of mass reference
  frame.</span> </p><p><span m='234990'>Now let's just double check our
  results.</span> </p><p><span m='237060'>We have V2 final is minus V2
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='240570'>So that's minus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='242400'>But there's another minus sign here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='245340'>So we have 2 minus signs.</span> </p><p><span m='247020'>So that's
  a plus.</span> </p><p><span m='248430'>And that's why we have a plus 1/3 V1
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='252960'>And finally, if we want to ask the
  question, what</span> <span m='255660'>are the velocities in the lab
  frame,</span> <span m='258329'>it's now a very simple exercise to do reference
  frame change.</span> </p><p><span m='263370'>We do need to know what V center
  of mass is.</span> </p><p><span m='266370'>That's V1 V initial over m1 plus
  m2, because remember</span> <span m='272250'>that V2 initial is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='275280'>So that's another factor, V1 initial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='279470'>And now for conclusion, we have that the final
  velocity</span> <span m='284280'>in the lab frame is equal to the
  velocity</span> <span m='290370'>in the center of mass frame plus V center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='294060'>And we just collect our results, minus
  2/3 V1</span> <span m='298800'>initial plus 1/3 V1 initial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='303000'>So that's minus 1/3 V1 initial.</span> </p><p><span
  m='306630'>The outgoing velocity of particle 1 in the lab frame</span> <span
  m='310890'>and the outgoing velocity of particle 2 in the lab frame,</span>
  <span m='317660'>again, we have 1/3 V1 initial plus another 1/3 V1
  initial</span> <span m='326370'>is equal to 2/3 V1 initial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='331080'>So we were able to solve this problem by switching
  reference</span> <span m='335130'>frame using our basic fact in the center of
  mass frame</span> <span m='340440'>that the speeds remain the same but the
  direction changes</span> <span m='344700'>and able to solve this problem
  without any</span> <span m='347940'>of the traditional ways of applying the
  energy momentum</span> <span m='352650'>relationship and kinetic energy or
  having quadratic equations.</span> </p><p></p>
