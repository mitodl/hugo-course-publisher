  <p><span m='3720'>So we're going to return to our one-dimensional
  elastic</span> <span m='6180'>collision with no external forces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='8070'>So we have object 1 moving with velocity V1 initial and
  object</span> <span m='14520'>2 maybe it's moving this way with V2 initial i
  hat,</span> <span m='19620'>again, on a frictionless surface.</span>
  </p><p><span m='21990'>And we'll call that our initial state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='26280'>And here you can imagine we're going to use a ground
  reference</span> <span m='28980'>frame.</span> </p><p><span m='29580'>So both
  objects are moving.</span> </p><p><span m='31350'>And our final state has
  object 1-- well,</span> <span m='36060'>we don't know, again, which way it's
  going.</span> </p><p><span m='38340'>We can just say it bounced back.</span>
  </p><p><span m='41970'>And object 2 also bounced back.</span> </p><p><span
  m='45036'>But the goal of our problem, of course,</span> <span m='46660'>is to
  determine these vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='49800'>And by knowing the
  vectors, we know which way they go.</span> </p><p><span m='52500'>Now because
  energy and momentum are constant,</span> <span m='55290'>let's write down our
  two equations.</span> </p><p><span m='56885'>And I'm going to write them
  down,</span> <span m='58260'>again, in terms of components.</span>
  </p><p><span m='61240'>So we have 1/2 m1 V1x initial squared plus 1/2</span>
  <span m='70030'>m2 V2x initial squared equals 1/2 m1 V1x final squared</span>
  <span m='80940'>plus 1/2 m2 V2x final squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='87520'>Now we're going to do some algebraic manipulations here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='90504'>So the first thing I'm going to do</span> <span
  m='91920'>is just eliminate these halves because it's not necessary.</span>
  </p><p><span m='96280'>And I don't want to rewrite this equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='98880'>And this is our fact that our energy is
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='102789'>And now our condition that momentum
  is constant,</span> <span m='106495'>we'll write this-- now, I'm going to
  leave a little space</span> <span m='108870'>here intentionally.</span>
  </p><p><span m='110300'>And our condition that momentum is constant</span>
  <span m='112110'>is m1 Vx initial plus m2 V2x initial equals m1 V1x</span>
  <span m='123840'>final plus m2 V2x final.</span> </p><p><span m='129030'>Now
  this energy equation can be factored in</span> <span m='133050'>by bringing
  all the m1 terms to one side and the M2 terms</span> <span m='137310'>to the
  other side.</span> </p><p><span m='138850'>So when I write that, I'll need a
  little room.</span> </p><p><span m='141060'>I have m1 V1x initial squared
  minus V1x final squared.</span> </p><p><span m='148680'>And that's equal to m2
  V2x final squared</span> <span m='153420'>minus V2x initial squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='157177'>So I've just brought those terms over to the other
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='159510'>Now likewise I'll do the same thing down
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='164550'>I have m1 V1x initial minus V1x
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='173070'>And that's equal to m2 V2x final minus
  V2x initial.</span> </p><p><span m='180630'>Now here comes the algebraic
  trick</span> <span m='183370'>in which I'm going to linearize these
  systems.</span> </p><p><span m='186180'>This is a squared minus b
  squared,</span> <span m='188950'>which factors into a plus b times a minus
  b.</span> </p><p><span m='192270'>So let's give ourselves a little
  room.</span> </p><p><span m='194070'>m1 V1x initial plus-- let's put the minus
  sign first.</span> </p><p><span m='202820'>minus V1x final times V1x initial
  plus V1x final.</span> </p><p><span m='212500'>Factored that term.</span>
  </p><p><span m='214040'>We have the same factoring on the other side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='217500'>So it's just identical, V2x final</span> <span
  m='220400'>minus V2x initial times V2x final plus V2x initial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='229680'>Now let's call this equation 1a and our momentum
  factored</span> <span m='237870'>as 2a.</span> </p><p><span m='239250'>Now if
  you notice, the momentum piece</span> <span m='242190'>is appearing exactly
  there and exactly here.</span> </p><p><span m='246850'>So when I divide 1a by
  2a-- and I'll just</span> <span m='250500'>symbolically represent that-- then
  these two pieces cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='255960'>And that leads to just
  this term equal to that term.</span> </p><p><span m='261420'>And the
  significance, as you'll see when I write it out,</span> <span m='264370'>1 of
  x 1x final equals V2x final plus V2x initial.</span> </p><p><span
  m='273360'>I've solved the quad-- I've eliminated the squared terms,</span>
  <span m='278190'>linearized the system.</span> </p><p><span m='280240'>Now I
  still want to write this equation in another way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='283440'>Another important point to notice</span> <span m='285420'>is that
  this equation is independent of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='289290'>Now what
  I want to do is write this</span> <span m='291150'>in terms of those concepts
  of relative velocity we had.</span> </p><p><span m='294400'>Remember just to
  motivate this, V relative by definition</span> <span m='299220'>was V1 minus
  V2.</span> </p><p><span m='301980'>So let's write this in terms of the initial
  and the final.</span> </p><p><span m='309030'>So in order to do that, we have
  to bring this initial term</span> <span m='312120'>over to here and this final
  term over to there.</span> </p><p><span m='315210'>And so this equation, which
  will give it a number 3,</span> <span m='320520'>and now we'll modify that by
  calling it 3a.</span> </p><p><span m='323760'>We have V1x initial minus V2x
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='330730'>Now notice the sign.</span>
  </p><p><span m='332270'>I'm going to want to keep the order of 1 and 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='334770'>So I have to put a minus sign, V1x final minus V2x
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='345909'>And when written this way, this is the
  initial component</span> <span m='351280'>of the relative velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='353290'>And in there is the final component of relative
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='356620'>So by combining these two
  equations,</span> <span m='358420'>I have this remarkable result that V
  relative initial</span> <span m='362830'>is minus V relative final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='369130'>And this condition is a very powerful tool</span>
  <span m='373390'>for simply analyzing one-dimensional elastic and</span> <span
  m='377740'>inelastic collisions.</span> </p><p><span m='378934'>I'd like to
  even give this a name.</span> </p><p><span m='380350'>I'd like to call it the
  energy momentum equation.</span> </p><p><span m='390890'>Now there's a lot of
  significant things about this.</span> </p><p><span m='393140'>So let's just
  think about it for a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='395390'>We have that V
  relative initial in magnitude</span> <span m='400100'>is equal to V relative
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='403060'>And so right away, this gives us some
  insight</span> <span m='405800'>into any collision.</span> </p><p><span
  m='406850'>We can see whether a collision, if we</span> <span m='409850'>know
  what the relative initial velocity is,</span> <span m='411800'>we know that
  the final relative velocity has the same magnitude</span> <span m='416240'>but
  simply switches direction.</span> </p><p><span m='418940'>And that's a
  powerful tool in which to analyze collisions</span> <span m='422030'>without
  doing a lot of algebra.</span> </p>
