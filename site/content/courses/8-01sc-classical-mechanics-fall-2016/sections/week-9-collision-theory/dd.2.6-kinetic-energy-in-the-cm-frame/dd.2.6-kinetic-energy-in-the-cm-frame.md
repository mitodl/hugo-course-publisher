title: DD.2.6 Kinetic Energy in the CM Frame
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3340'>Let's calculate the kinetic energy</span> <span m='5020'>in
  the center of mass frame of two objects that are colliding.</span>
  </p><p><span m='8800'>I'm going to use prime for the center of mass frame
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='12020'>So we have V1 prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='14180'>And we have V2 prime.</span> </p><p><span m='17140'>And
  recall two things that when we calculated V1 prime</span> <span m='21400'>in
  the center of mass frame, we found</span> <span m='23560'>that this was equal
  to the reduced mass</span> <span m='26560'>divided by m1 times the relative
  velocities</span> <span m='31030'>of the two objects, V1 prime minus V2
  prime.</span> </p><p><span m='36070'>Now in the center of mass frame, this
  quantity</span> <span m='40960'>is a reference frame independent.</span>
  </p><p><span m='43130'>And so we can just write that as V1, 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='47440'>It's the relative velocity is reference frame
  independent.</span> </p><p><span m='62020'>So we also knew that V2 prime
  was</span> <span m='66160'>equal to minus mu over m2 V1, 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='71980'>So now let's calculate the kinetic energy</span> <span
  m='74530'>in the center of mass frame.</span> </p><p><span m='76300'>So K cm
  is 1/2 m1 V1 prime squared</span> <span m='83170'>plus 1/2 m2 V2 prime
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='87289'>Now let's use our results in terms of
  relative velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='90620'>So we have 1/2 m1 mu over and
  m1 times V1,</span> <span m='99729'>2 squared-- because we're squaring</span>
  <span m='103500'>that-- plus 1/2 m2 mu-- the minus sign doesn't matter</span>
  <span m='108430'>anymore because we're squaring it--</span> <span
  m='110800'>V2 squared-- I could put that in there, it wouldn't matter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='114970'>And now what we have is we have 1/2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='119350'>One of the m1s cancels so we have a mu squared over m1
  V1, 2</span> <span m='126160'>squared plus 1/2 another mu square over m2
  times</span> <span m='132070'>V1, 2 squared.</span> </p><p><span m='134590'>So
  I pull out the common terms, mu square, V1, 2 squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='140410'>I have 1 over m1 plus 1 over m2.</span> </p><p><span m='144700'>But
  recall that the reduced mass was precisely 1 over m1</span> <span
  m='150460'>plus 1 over m2.</span> </p><p><span m='152380'>And so I get 1/2 mu
  times V1, 2 squared</span> <span m='158079'>is the kinetic energy in the
  center of mass frame.</span> </p><p><span m='161650'>So what that means is a
  way of thinking</span> <span m='166090'>if this were just a simple reduced
  mass</span> <span m='168030'>problem with a relative speed of V1, 2
  squared,</span> <span m='171579'>I can write down the kinetic energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='173710'>But that's the kinetic energy in the center of mass
  frame.</span> </p><p><span m='178780'>And therefore, the change in kinetic
  energy in a collision</span> <span m='183850'>is just 1/2 V1, 2 V final
  squared minus--</span> <span m='191140'>and it's the same mu, so we'll
  just</span> <span m='193750'>put a parentheses-- minus V1, 2 initial
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='203079'>And if the collision is elastic--
  remember,</span> <span m='206530'>our elastic collision show that V1, 2
  initial</span> <span m='214000'>was minus V1, 2 final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='218320'>So an elastic collision satisfies that condition.</span>
  </p><p><span m='222079'>And you can see directly that delta Kcm is 0 in that
  case.</span> </p><p><span m='227360'>And a completely inelastic
  collision</span> <span m='229960'>has the two objects moving together at the
  end.</span> </p><p><span m='232840'>So V1, 2 final is 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='235240'>So completely inelastic is the condition that V1, 2 final</span>
  <span m='246820'>is 0 because the objects stick together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='250820'>And then have a very simple result</span> <span m='252670'>for the
  change in kinetic energy for completely</span> <span m='255310'>inelastic
  collision.</span> </p><p><span m='256600'>It's only negative 1/2 mu V1, 2
  initial quantity squared.</span> </p><p></p>
