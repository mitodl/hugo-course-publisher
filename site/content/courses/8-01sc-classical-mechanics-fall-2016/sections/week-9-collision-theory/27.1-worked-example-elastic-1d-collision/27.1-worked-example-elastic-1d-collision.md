  <p><span m='3390'>Let's look at some examples of one</span> <span
  m='4920'>dimensional elastic collisions with no external forces</span> <span
  m='9144'>between two particles.</span> </p><p><span m='10060'>So suppose I
  have particle 1 and particle 2,</span> <span m='12740'>and we have them moving
  on a frictionless surface.</span> </p><p><span m='15750'>And let's choose a
  reference frame</span> <span m='19380'>in which we'll call-- the
  laboratory</span> <span m='21090'>frame-- in which the initial velocity of
  particle 2 0.</span> </p><p><span m='26070'>So our frame is called the
  laboratory frame.</span> </p><p><span m='32650'>And in this frame we're
  thinking of particle 2 as our target.</span> </p><p><span m='38530'>And the
  target is at rest.</span> </p><p><span m='39970'>And particle 1 is moving in
  with some initial velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='44050'>And so here is our
  initial picture.</span> </p><p><span m='47920'>And then in our final state,
  both the target</span> <span m='50410'>and the particles can be moving.</span>
  </p><p><span m='52780'>So we'll just indicate v1 final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='55630'>And we'll have target was also moving with v2 final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='60640'>And we have i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='62016'>So
  let's now look at some examples</span> <span m='64150'>where we're analyzing
  this type of collision</span> <span m='66850'>in which both energy and
  momentum are constant.</span> </p><p><span m='71050'>And for a particular
  example that we want to look at,</span> <span m='75820'>we'll have m2 is twice
  m1.</span> </p><p><span m='82360'>Now, for our two equations that we're going
  to write about,</span> <span m='84850'>we'll choose components, and we'll
  write our energy equation</span> <span m='89260'>as 1/2 m1 v1 x initial
  squared plus 1/2 m2--</span> <span m='99910'>so now we're going to write 2
  m1.</span> </p><p><span m='103090'>But object 2 is at rest, so we don't
  have</span> <span m='105910'>to worry about that one yet.</span> </p><p><span
  m='108259'>And so, our initial kinetic energy</span> <span m='110740'>is just
  equal to the final kinetic energy--</span> <span m='113170'>1/2 m1 v1 x final
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='117920'>And now I'm going to substitute in 2m1
  for the mass of m2</span> <span m='122590'>v2 x final squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='127310'>And that's our energy condition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='130240'>And then our momentum condition is</span> <span m='132340'>that the
  incoming momentum, 1/2 x initial</span> <span m='135490'>is equal to the
  outgoing momentum, m1 v1 x final.</span> </p><p><span m='140800'>And again,
  I'm going to substitute for m2.</span> </p><p><span m='143920'>That's 2m1 v2 x
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='149050'>And these two equations represent</span>
  <span m='154329'>a system of two equations with two unknowns.</span>
  </p><p><span m='156950'>We'll treat this as givens along with the initial
  velocity</span> <span m='166030'>of particle 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='167230'>And our target here is to solve for the 1x final and v2 x</span>
  <span m='178050'>final.</span> </p><p><span m='178690'>So we have two
  equations and two unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='181630'>Now it's a
  quadratic equation.</span> </p><p><span m='183580'>So we have to identify--
  from a problem solving strategy,</span> <span m='186070'>we have to identify
  which quantity</span> <span m='187930'>we're going to solve first.</span>
  </p><p><span m='190050'>And so, let's solve for v1 x final, which</span> <span
  m='192760'>means we need to eliminate v2 x final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='195700'>And the way I'll eliminate v2 x final</span> <span m='197740'>is
  I'll use the momentum equation.</span> </p><p><span m='200300'>And notice that
  the m's will cancel</span> <span m='202360'>in the momentum equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='203980'>And so, if I divide through by 2m in the momentum
  equation</span> <span m='208270'>and bring this term over to the other
  side,</span> <span m='211570'>equation 2a becomes v2 x final equals--</span>
  <span m='218950'>I'm dividing through by 2-- 1/2 v1 x initial minus 1/2 v1
  x</span> <span m='228790'>final.</span> </p><p><span m='230170'>So this gives
  me a target-- v2 x final--</span> <span m='233860'>I can substitute into
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='235510'>This equation, again, can be cleaned
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='237310'>Let's clean it up before.</span>
  </p><p><span m='238531'>We can get rid of the halves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='239740'>We can get rid of the m1's.</span> </p><p><span m='241420'>And so
  the quadratic equation that we're</span> <span m='244360'>going to be working
  with is v1 x initial squared</span> <span m='248350'>equals v1 x final
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='253160'>And I'm dividing through by 2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='255220'>So I have the factor 2 plus 2 v2 x final
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='262070'>Now that's our energy equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='265120'>And here's our momentum equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='267620'>So if we substitute this in and square it,</span> <span
  m='271180'>we can now substitute and we get v1 x initial squared equals</span>
  <span m='276340'>v1 x final squared plus 2.</span> </p><p><span m='279200'>Now
  we make our substitution.</span> </p><p><span m='281409'>So that's 1/2 v1 x
  initial minus 1/2 v1 x final,</span> <span m='288790'>quantity squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='290300'>So let's now expand this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='294520'>And we have to be careful not to make any mistakes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='298000'>v1 x initial squared equals v1 x final squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='303460'>Now if I pull the 2 out, I got a quarter in
  front,</span> <span m='310240'>and divide that by 1/2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='312310'>So I get 1/2 v1 x initial squared plus another 1</span> <span
  m='322870'>plus a 1/2 v1 x final squared.</span> </p><p><span m='327460'>Those
  represent the-- squaring out those two terms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='330310'>Now the cross-term will have a factor of 1/2</span> <span
  m='335740'>in the front but a factor of 2.</span> </p><p><span m='338150'>So
  we have a simple cross-term of v1 x initial v1 x final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='351580'>Now, when we-- let's collect terms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='356170'>Let's bring everything over to this side</span> <span m='358450'>so
  we have a 0 equals 3/2 v1 x final squared minus 1/2 v1</span> <span
  m='367060'>x initial squared and minus v1 x initial v1 x final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='375370'>Now I always like to just write this up in a simple
  way</span> <span m='379030'>to use the quadratic formula.</span> </p><p><span
  m='381350'>So I'm going to divide through by 2/3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='384010'>And I get minus 1/3 v1 x initial squared minus 2/3 v1</span> <span
  m='391300'>x initial v1 x final.</span> </p><p><span m='395260'>And this is
  now a simple application</span> <span m='397960'>of the quadratic
  formula.</span> </p><p><span m='400150'>Negative b is plus 2/3 v1 x initial
  plus or minus.</span> </p><p><span m='407060'>And we're going to interpret
  those two roots in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='409570'>We have to factor
  2/3 v1 x initial squared minus 4ac.</span> </p><p><span m='419230'>So that's
  another minus sign with a plus.</span> </p><p><span m='422700'>So that's plus
  4/3 v1 x initial squared,</span> <span m='428320'>all to the square root, and
  everything divided by 2.</span> </p><p><span m='433210'>Now here, let's just
  look at this factor.</span> </p><p><span m='435370'>This is 4/9 plus
  4/3.</span> </p><p><span m='439480'>4/3 is 12/9, so that's 16/9, which</span>
  <span m='442930'>is very convenient, because when you take the square root
  that's</span> <span m='445600'>4/3.</span> </p><p><span m='446900'>So we get
  equal to 2/3 v1 x initial plus or minus 4/3 v1 x</span> <span
  m='455060'>initial divided by 2.</span> </p><p><span m='459260'>Now we see
  that there's two different roots.</span> </p><p><span m='462370'>So when you
  add them, you get 2 v1 x initial divided by 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='469180'>So there's one solution.</span> </p><p><span m='472120'>And when
  you subtract them, you're getting 2/3 minus 4/3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='478030'>That's negative 2/3 divided by 2.</span> </p><p><span m='481270'>So
  that is another solution-- v1 x final equals negative 1/3</span> <span
  m='486550'>v1 x initial.</span> </p><p><span m='489850'>Now let's think about
  the meaning of these two</span> <span m='492610'>possible solutions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='495370'>This solution has v1 x final equals v1 x
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='500500'>So that's the initial
  conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='503710'>Just repeat it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='504880'>And that will always be the case.</span> </p><p><span
  m='506900'>One solution will describe the initial state,</span> <span
  m='509380'>and the other solution will define the final state.</span>
  </p><p><span m='511810'>You can check for yourself that if you just</span>
  <span m='514000'>put vx1 final into this-- equal to vx1 in the
  initial--</span> <span m='518380'>into this momentum equation, then v2 x
  final</span> <span m='521650'>is 0, which just repeats the initial
  conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='525020'>So this solution is the initial
  state.</span> </p><p><span m='531970'>And this solution, here, is the final
  state.</span> </p><p><span m='536890'>Now just to complete the picture,</span>
  <span m='539020'>v2 x final-- well, that's equal to 1/2 v1</span> <span
  m='545010'>x initial minus 1/2 times v1 x final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='551680'>But v1 x final is negative 1/3.</span> </p><p><span m='554890'>So
  we have a 1/2 minus 1/2 half times minus 1/3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='559720'>So that's 1/2 plus 1/6, which is 4/6 or 2/3 v x initial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='566800'>So that's 2/3 the v1 x initial.</span> </p><p><span
  m='573160'>And that represents the solution to this particular problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='577970'>Now, of course what you want to do is,</span> <span
  m='581530'>you want to check-- we know the momentum condition is</span> <span
  m='583810'>already satisfied.</span> </p><p><span m='585010'>But just as a
  check, you would like</span> <span m='586930'>to put it into the energy
  condition</span> <span m='588910'>just to make sure that when you square these
  things out</span> <span m='592150'>you get the right terms.</span>
  </p><p><span m='593680'>However, we're very confident of our result,</span>
  <span m='596420'>because we've already reproduced the initial
  conditions.</span> </p><p><span m='599410'>And that wouldn't happen if we made
  some algebraic mistake.</span> </p><p><span m='602990'>So that, by itself, is
  a sufficient check</span> <span m='605380'>that this is a correct
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='607210'>One thing we should sit back and
  think about</span> <span m='609520'>is that when we use the energy and
  momentum</span> <span m='612070'>that we're inevitably dealing with
  quadratics.</span> </p><p><span m='615430'>And so we expect to use-- to solve
  a quadratic equation</span> <span m='619420'>at one point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='620590'>And here it was right here.</span> </p><p><span m='622732'>Now
  we're going to find another way</span> <span m='624190'>to do this by
  linearizing the system, which</span> <span m='626770'>will be a lot
  easier.</span> </p><p></p>
