title: 26.3 Totally Inelastic Collisions
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3290'>Let's analyze a one-dimensional collision,</span> <span
  m='6390'>where we're in the laboratory reference frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8520'>And we have V1 initial and V2 initial is 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='16079'>It's a frictionless surface.</span> </p><p><span m='18750'>But
  there's a collision here.</span> </p><p><span m='20640'>And now we're going to
  make this collision totally inelastic.</span> </p><p><span m='27600'>Now what
  that means is that the two particles stick together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34690'>So if this is our initial state--</span> <span m='39550'>and let's,
  again, choose a direction i hat-- then</span> <span m='43580'>our final state
  will just stick those two particles together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='48560'>And they're going to move.</span> </p><p><span m='50060'>We only
  need one velocity for the final state, i hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='55430'>Now again, let's assume that there's no external forces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='63270'>There are clearly internal forces</span> <span
  m='65519'>that are acting between the two particles as they collide.</span>
  </p><p><span m='69960'>But, remember, we know that internal forces</span>
  <span m='71850'>cancel in pairs.</span> </p><p><span m='73170'>And if there's
  no external forces,</span> <span m='74880'>the momentum of the system is
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='77320'>So we can write down our momentum
  condition very simply.</span> </p><p><span m='79920'>And we'll write it again
  in terms of components.</span> </p><p><span m='82350'>We have some incoming
  momentum into the system.</span> </p><p><span m='85770'>And all of that
  incoming momentum is going out.</span> </p><p><span m='94250'>And now, is
  energy constant?</span> </p><p><span m='98500'>Well, a totally inelastic
  collision,</span> <span m='100880'>energy cannot be constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='103680'>And the reason is that these internal forces</span>
  <span m='106460'>will cause deformations that are irreversible.</span>
  </p><p><span m='109830'>So the objects might be deformed,</span> <span
  m='114020'>which is a loss of-- some of that kinetic energy will</span> <span
  m='117229'>go into deformation.</span> </p><p><span m='118670'>There could be
  noise.</span> </p><p><span m='119750'>There could be heat generated in the
  collision, lots of sources.</span> </p><p><span m='122810'>When objects stick
  together, kinetic energy is not constant.</span> </p><p><span m='126180'>In
  fact, we can even figure out the change in kinetic energy,</span> <span
  m='130070'>because we can see here that Vx final is m1 over m1 plus m2
  V1</span> <span m='138020'>x initial.</span> </p><p><span m='139610'>And now
  let's ask ourselves, in a totally inelastic collision</span> <span
  m='143090'>what is the change in the kinetic energy?</span> </p><p><span
  m='148160'>So our final kinetic energy is 1/2 m1 plus m2 V-- here,</span>
  <span m='156890'>we can, again, right in terms of components-- Vx
  final,</span> <span m='160867'>because the component's squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='162200'>That's no problem.</span> </p><p><span m='163430'>And
  we just have this initial kinetic energy coming in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='168110'>Now we have a solution for our problems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='170520'>So let's just put that in.</span> </p><p><span m='174110'>m1 plus
  m2 times m1 over m1 plus m2 times V1</span> <span m='182900'>x initial squared
  minus 1/2 m1 V1 x initial squared.</span> </p><p><span m='189270'>And now
  let's pull out the 1/2 m1</span> <span m='193160'>V1 x initial squared-- 1/2
  one factor of m1 V1 x</span> <span m='198829'>initial squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='200550'>But what we're left with here is another factor of
  m1.</span> </p><p><span m='204770'>And downstairs, we have an m1 plus
  m2</span> <span m='207200'>outside but an m1 plus m2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='210079'>Now remember, we didn't square that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='213050'>We have an m1 plus m2 inside.</span> </p><p><span m='216320'>So
  there's that m1 plus m2 minus 1.</span> </p><p><span m='221390'>Now this is
  the initial kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='224880'>And when we
  subtract these terms,</span> <span m='226579'>we have negative m2 over m1 plus
  m2.</span> </p><p><span m='231829'>And so what we see here is-- I'm
  just</span> <span m='234920'>going to rewrite this again-- that the kinetic
  energy,</span> <span m='239720'>the change in kinetic energy, just</span>
  <span m='241670'>depends on the initial kinetic energy and this mass
  ratio.</span> </p><p><span m='246600'>In fact, if we asked ourselves,
  what</span> <span m='249170'>is the ratio of that loss of kinetic
  energy</span> <span m='253670'>to the initial kinetic energy, that just</span>
  <span m='255920'>depends on the mass ratio of our two objects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='261019'>In particular, it should be a minus sign,</span> <span
  m='263330'>because the kinetic energy is decreasing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='267840'>And so this is the fact that it's very transparent now</span> <span
  m='272780'>that in a totally inelastic collision</span> <span m='275450'>the
  kinetic energy is not constant.</span> </p><p><span m='278510'>Where did that
  energy go?</span> </p><p><span m='279650'>It went into other forms of
  energy.</span> </p><p></p>
