transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3610'>We'd like to examine the motion of two particles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='5910'>Here's particle 1.</span> </p><p><span m='7270'>And
  here's particle 2.</span> </p><p><span m='8710'>And each particle can have
  some motion.</span> </p><p><span m='11620'>In between them is the center of
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='14327'>And what we'd like to do is figure
  out</span> <span m='15910'>how to describe the motion of each of these
  particles</span> <span m='18580'>with respect to the center of mass.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20500'>So let's choose some coordinate system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='22870'>Origin down here.</span> </p><p><span m='24650'>Here's
  our particle r1.</span> </p><p><span m='26680'>Here's our particle r2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='28540'>And here is our center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='31130'>Now in the reference frame of the center of mass,</span> <span
  m='33940'>we have position vector r1 prime.</span> </p><p><span m='36800'>And
  we have position vector r2 prime.</span> </p><p><span m='39907'>And what we'd
  like to do is find expressions</span> <span m='41740'>for r2 prime and r2
  prime in terms</span> <span m='44500'>of the positions of r1 and r2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='48340'>Now we call that the position of the center of mass for
  this two</span> <span m='52090'>body problem is given by m2 m1 r1 plus m2 r2
  divided</span> <span m='58120'>by the total mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='60160'>And here we use the vector triangle</span> <span m='62590'>that r1
  prime equals r1 minus center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='69130'>Now
  remember this vector is equal to this vector</span> <span m='72910'>minus that
  vector.</span> </p><p><span m='73800'>Sometimes people like to say the
  vector</span> <span m='76150'>r1 is equal to r plus r prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m='79300'>And that's how we get that relationship.</span>
  </p><p><span m='81590'>Now we can use our result here that r1 prime</span>
  <span m='84940'>is r1 minus m1 r1 plus m2 r2 divided by m1 plus m2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='95110'>And when we combine terms-- let's just do this</span>
  <span m='98020'>so you can see it-- r1 minus m1 r1 plus m2 r2</span> <span
  m='105130'>divided by the total mass.</span> </p><p><span m='107740'>We now
  have the m1 r1 terms cancel.</span> </p><p><span m='110830'>And we have a
  common m2 over m1 plus m2 times r1 minus r2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='118970'>Now r1 minus r2 is a vector that goes from-- here is r1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='126520'>Here's r2.</span> </p><p><span m='127960'>So the
  vector r1 minus r2 is the relative position</span> <span m='135760'>of vector
  1 with respect to 2.</span> </p><p><span m='138860'>And let's give that a
  special name.</span> </p><p><span m='142400'>We'll call that r1, 2, the
  relative position vector.</span> </p><p><span m='147040'>So we have m2 over m1
  plus m2 r1, 2 is r1 prime.</span> </p><p><span m='155170'>Now you can easily
  see that if you interchange</span> <span m='161079'>the indices 1 and 2, the
  only thing that changes here</span> <span m='166150'>is a sign.</span>
  </p><p><span m='167500'>And if we interchange 1 and 2-- and this is an
  exercise</span> <span m='170500'>that you can do-- then r2 prime is
  minus</span> <span m='175440'>m1-- I'm interchanging the indices.</span>
  </p><p><span m='178420'>The minus sign came from the interchange of 1 and
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='183260'>And so we get m1 over m1 plus m2 with the
  minus sign r1, 2.</span> </p><p><span m='191020'>Now what is the significance
  of this result?</span> </p><p><span m='193840'>If you know the position of r1
  and r2,</span> <span m='197079'>you know the relative velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='199420'>If you have information about this relative
  position,</span> <span m='202540'>if you know the relative position
  vector,</span> <span m='204490'>then you can separately get the locations of
  the two objects</span> <span m='208870'>in the center of mass frame.</span>
  </p><p><span m='210820'>Now this quantity in here will appear often.</span>
  </p><p><span m='214780'>And I'd like to introduce a new quantity called</span>
  <span m='217210'>the reduced mass.</span> </p><p><span m='220030'>And that
  reduced mass, mu, is the product</span> <span m='223360'>of m1 m2 over m1 plus
  m2.</span> </p><p><span m='227140'>It's a simple exercise to see that 1 over
  mu is 1 over m1</span> <span m='232150'>plus 1 over m2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='233950'>And we'll encounter that a little bit later.</span> </p><p><span
  m='236860'>Then I can write both of these vectors--</span> <span
  m='240340'>and this is our conclusion-- that r1 prime is the reduced</span>
  <span m='244330'>mass.</span> </p><p><span m='244960'>Notice we have an m2
  here, so we have to divide by m1 times</span> <span m='249880'>the vector r1,
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='251830'>And r2 prime is minus the reduced
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='255250'>Again, we now have to divide by
  m2.</span> </p><p><span m='259329'>And you see this nice symmetry of m1 and 1,
  2 and 2, r1, 2.</span> </p><p><span m='265540'>And that's our key
  result.</span> </p>
