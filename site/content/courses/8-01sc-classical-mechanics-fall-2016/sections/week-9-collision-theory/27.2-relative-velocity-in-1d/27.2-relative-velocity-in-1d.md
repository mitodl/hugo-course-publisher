  <p><span m='4300'>For one-dimensional collisions, let's talk about two
  objects, 1</span> <span m='8440'>and object 2, moving with velocity V1 and
  another object</span> <span m='14170'>V2 moving with velocity V2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='17046'>Let's say they're moving on the ground.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18670'>Now I'd like to introduce the concept of relative
  velocity,</span> <span m='21790'>a concept that we experience all the time in
  our lives.</span> </p><p><span m='24940'>But let's see what it actually
  means.</span> </p><p><span m='27250'>So V relative, I'm going to define</span>
  <span m='30370'>this to be the velocity of V1 minus the velocity of V2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='35730'>Now because of this minus sign that seems a little
  bit</span> <span m='38500'>about abstract.</span> </p><p><span m='39920'>But
  one typical example where we see this all the time</span> <span m='43250'>is
  for people traveling on highways.</span> </p><p><span m='45640'>You might have
  two cars, one car overtaking the other car.</span> </p><p><span m='49300'>But
  if you're sitting in car 1, it</span> <span m='51580'>looks like car 2 is
  going quite slow.</span> </p><p><span m='54580'>So let's just take typical
  highway example.</span> </p><p><span m='57460'>So you might have V1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='59590'>And we'll give it some speed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='60970'>So we'll make it 60 miles per hour.</span> </p><p><span
  m='63910'>And we'll just call this one-dimensional problem i hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='68350'>And V2-- notice we're not speeding</span> <span
  m='71410'>on a highway-- V2 is going at 50 miles per hour,</span> <span
  m='75789'>i hat, very slow.</span> </p><p><span m='78580'>And the relative
  velocity, V1 minus V2-- so that's</span> <span m='82690'>what we're calling V
  relative-- that's 60 miles per hour</span> <span m='88990'>minus 50 miles per
  hour i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='92830'>And that's just 10 miles per
  hour.</span> </p><p><span m='94490'>And that's what people experience when one
  car is</span> <span m='97539'>approaching another car.</span> </p><p><span
  m='100450'>If you're in car 2, car 1 seems like it's coming</span> <span
  m='103539'>at you at 10 miles per hour.</span> </p><p><span m='105560'>This is
  what we mean by relative velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='107710'>There's
  another important example--</span> <span m='109720'>so that's example 1-- the
  other important example to look at,</span> <span m='115030'>example 2, is when
  two objects are</span> <span m='118240'>moving in opposite directions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='121370'>So let's just see write them in terms of components
  this time.</span> </p><p><span m='127810'>So we have V2 x1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='129699'>And we have V2.</span> </p><p><span m='131830'>And
  let's make V1 x positive.</span> </p><p><span m='134620'>So object 1 is moving
  in that direction.</span> </p><p><span m='137950'>And let's write this one as
  V2 x.</span> </p><p><span m='141370'>We don't have to call this
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='143760'>We'll just call it V2 x i hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='147740'>And here V2 x is equal to minus V1 x.</span>
  </p><p><span m='153220'>So its component is negative.</span> </p><p><span
  m='156160'>And even though we drew an arrow in this picture,</span> <span
  m='158620'>the picture is still fine, because if the component is</span> <span
  m='160870'>negative, it means it's moving in the opposite direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='164260'>The key arrow is the unit vector when we are writing
  components.</span> </p><p><span m='169000'>And now V relative in this case is
  V1 x i hat minus V2 x i hat.</span> </p><p><span m='177880'>That's the V1 x i
  hat minus minus.</span> </p><p><span m='181750'>So there's another V1 x i
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='185320'>So the relative velocity in this
  case</span> <span m='188560'>has a component that's twice the speed of
  V1.</span> </p><p><span m='192520'>If two objects are moving together at the
  same speed,</span> <span m='196210'>the relative velocity, the way we've
  defined it,</span> <span m='198820'>has twice the magnitude of either
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='203030'>And this is an important example to
  consider in collisions.</span> </p><p><span m='207020'>Now this relative
  velocity concept we'll see we'll</span> <span m='210850'>add a new way of
  thinking about elastic collisions</span> <span m='215560'>with no external
  forces in one dimension.</span> </p>
