title: DD.2.7 Change in the Kinetic Energy
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3800'>Now when we did these calculation,</span> <span m='6170'>we
  saw that the kinetic energy in the ground frame</span> <span m='11990'>was
  equal to the kinetic energy in the center of mass frame</span> <span
  m='16190'>plus a constant term, m1 plus m2 times Vcm squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='22460'>And this is a constant whether you're</span> <span
  m='25340'>in the initial or the final picture.</span> </p><p><span
  m='27140'>So if we look at the change in kinetic energy</span> <span
  m='30560'>in the ground frame, that's equal to the change</span> <span
  m='33430'>in kinetic energy in the center of mass frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='35910'>But this term is a constant.</span> </p><p><span m='38180'>So
  there's no change in that term.</span> </p><p><span m='41090'>And so we have a
  crucial result that the change</span> <span m='44450'>in kinetic energy in the
  ground frame</span> <span m='46130'>is equal to the change in kinetic
  energy</span> <span m='48680'>in the center of mass frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='50330'>Now let's look at an example of a collision that's</span> <span
  m='53150'>completely inelastic.</span> </p><p><span m='56160'>So we have
  object one.</span> </p><p><span m='58250'>And it's coming in with V1
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='62050'>And object 2, let's make it at
  rest.</span> </p><p><span m='65750'>And afterwards object 1 and 2 stick
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='70640'>And they go off with V final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='73880'>So here's a collision in an inelastic frame.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78830'>Now in the center of mass frame, the two objects-- so
  here's</span> <span m='83630'>our lab or ground frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='87450'>I can call it the lab frame because that one is at rest.</span>
  </p><p><span m='90080'>And this is the cm frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='94780'>And there we have V1 prime and V2 prime.</span> </p><p><span
  m='101670'>They're both moving.</span> </p><p><span m='102930'>And now in the
  center of mass frame,</span> <span m='107789'>they're at rest at the end of
  the collision.</span> </p><p><span m='111840'>So in this collision, we can
  analyze it.</span> </p><p><span m='117240'>And now what I want to show is that
  the change</span> <span m='120740'>in kinetic energy, recall from our previous
  calculation,</span> <span m='125850'>that the kinetic energy in the center of
  mass frame</span> <span m='129478'>was equal to 1/2 mu times the relative
  velocity squared.</span> </p><p><span m='139840'>So remember V1, 2 was equal
  to V1 minus V2.</span> </p><p><span m='145710'>And so the change in kinetic
  energy</span> <span m='148800'>in the center of mass frame is the final
  kinetic energy</span> <span m='152760'>is 0 minus 1/2 the kinetic energy in
  the initial state.</span> </p><p><span m='160020'>And what is this quantity
  initial?</span> </p><p><span m='162450'>Well, this was a reference frame
  independent concept.</span> </p><p><span m='165990'>So we can just look at the
  lab frame.</span> </p><p><span m='168490'>And right this as V1 initial i
  hat</span> <span m='172470'>where that's i hat because this object is at
  rest.</span> </p><p><span m='175960'>And so right away we have that the change
  in kinetic energy</span> <span m='179310'>is minus 1/2-- now remember mu was
  m1 m2 over m1 plus m2</span> <span m='185430'>times V1 initial mean
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='188490'>And that's the same change in kinetic
  energy as the ground</span> <span m='192390'>frame.</span> </p><p><span
  m='193620'>So by using our result here and our result there,</span> <span
  m='198480'>we were able to very quickly assess</span> <span m='201120'>how
  much kinetic energy is lost in this inelastic collision.</span> </p><p><span
  m='205177'>And where does that kinetic energy go?</span> </p><p><span
  m='206760'>It can go to a variety of places, deformation of objects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='209940'>It can go into sound.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211380'>It can go into thermal energy that</span> <span m='220660'>diffuses
  into the environment.</span> </p><p><span m='222520'>However, that's how much
  is changed.</span> </p>
