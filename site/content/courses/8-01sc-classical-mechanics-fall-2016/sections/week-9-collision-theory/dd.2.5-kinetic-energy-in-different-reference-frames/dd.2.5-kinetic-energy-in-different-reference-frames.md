  <p><span m='3480'>Let's compare kinetic energies in a two particle</span>
  <span m='5850'>one-dimensional collision in different reference frames.</span>
  </p><p><span m='9190'>So we could have one reference frame</span> <span
  m='11040'>in which particle 1 is coming in and particle 2 is</span> <span
  m='15870'>moving like that.</span> </p><p><span m='17370'>And in particular--
  so we can call this the ground frame.</span> </p><p><span m='21750'>And now
  let's consider the center of mass frame.</span> </p><p><span m='25850'>And in
  the center of mass frame, let's</span> <span m='27780'>remind you that when we
  have two different reference frames,</span> <span m='32670'>the velocity--
  we'll call this the ground frame</span> <span m='36510'>g-- in the ground
  frame is equal to the velocity of the object--</span> <span m='42900'>we'll
  actually write it this way, just unprime,</span> <span m='45990'>V1-- the
  velocity in the center of mass frame--</span> <span m='50890'>so this is the
  velocity in the cm frame--</span> <span m='55560'>plus the relative velocities
  between the frames.</span> </p><p><span m='58770'>And that's why that's the
  velocity of the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='61290'>So this was our
  rule for describing</span> <span m='64080'>how velocities change in different
  reference frames.</span> </p><p><span m='67077'>And so we can draw the picture
  in the center</span> <span m='68910'>of mass frame, V1 initial prime and V2
  initial prime.</span> </p><p><span m='77400'>Now let's compare kinetic
  energies</span> <span m='79650'>in these different frames.</span> </p><p><span
  m='81460'>So we know that the kinetic energy</span> <span m='84600'>in the
  center of mass frame is just 1/2 m1 V1 initial squared</span> <span
  m='90690'>prime-- put the prime there-- plus 1/2</span> <span m='97650'>V2
  initial prime squared, kinetic energy</span> <span m='102150'>in the center of
  mass frame.</span> </p><p><span m='103680'>How do we calculate the kinetic
  energy in the lab frame?</span> </p><p><span m='107789'>Well, that's a little
  bit more complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='110190'>And we'll need a little
  algebra to start that.</span> </p><p><span m='112710'>So let's put kinetic
  energy in the ground frame.</span> </p><p><span m='116640'>We know is 1/2 m1
  V1 initial squared</span> <span m='121230'>plus 1/2 m2 V2 initial
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='126370'>Now what I have to do is use the law,
  the velocity relationship.</span> </p><p><span m='130978'>And this is going to
  take a little bit algebra.</span> </p><p><span m='133620'>We have m1-- I'll
  write V1 prime plus Vcm.</span> </p><p><span m='141900'>And remember that any
  quantity squared is the dot product,</span> <span m='146300'>V dot V. So I'm
  going to dot this with itself.</span> </p><p><span m='152130'>V1 initial prime
  plus the center of mass.</span> </p><p><span m='158800'>And I have the second
  term which looks</span> <span m='160579'>identical to this first term.</span>
  </p><p><span m='162320'>I'll write it all the way down here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='163820'>1/2 m2 V2 initial prime plus Vcm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='170240'>Vector dot scalar dot product of V2 initial prime plus Vcm.</span>
  </p><p><span m='179810'>Now when you take a dot product, remember</span> <span
  m='182300'>there's four terms here.</span> </p><p><span m='183860'>There's V1
  prime dot V1 prime, which is just V1 prime squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='189050'>There's V center of mass dot V center of mass.</span> </p><p><span
  m='192422'>So that's V center of mass squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='193880'>And then there's the cross term.</span> </p><p><span m='195620'>And
  because they're identical, there's a factor of 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='198290'>And it will be repeated below.</span> </p><p><span m='200690'>So
  the kinetic energy in the ground frame is 1/2 m1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='208340'>So we'll take v1 i prime dotted with itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211760'>That's V1 i prime squared.</span> </p><p><span m='214940'>We have
  the cross term, which is a factor</span> <span m='216890'>of 2, which will
  cancel this.</span> </p><p><span m='219050'>So the cross term is . m1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='222810'>That canceled the factor of 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='224990'>V1 i prime dot Vcm plus the Vcm with itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='234720'>So that's 1/2 m1 Vcm squared.</span> </p><p><span m='238980'>Now I
  have exactly the same thing on the next one.</span> </p><p><span m='241769'>So
  we'll write that down.</span> </p><p><span m='242810'>1/2 V2 i prime squared
  plus m2 V2i prime dot Vcm.</span> </p><p><span m='251240'>That's the same in
  both.</span> </p><p><span m='253050'>Plus 1/2 m2 Vcm squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='258420'>Now let's look carefully at what we.</span>
  </p><p><span m='261260'>Have 1/2 m1 V1 prime squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='265260'>This is an m2.</span> </p><p><span m='267050'>1/2 m2 V2 i prime
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='269960'>So we have 1/2 m1 V1i prime
  squared</span> <span m='276010'>plus 1/2 m2 V2i prime squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='279722'>And you're already noticing that's the kinetic
  energy</span> <span m='281930'>in the center of mass frame.</span>
  </p><p><span m='284090'>We have the total mass, 1/2 m1 plus m2 Vcm
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='292159'>I can just put a little check to
  show</span> <span m='294530'>which terms I've done so far.</span> </p><p><span
  m='296659'>And now here's the interesting one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='298850'>We have m1 V1i prime plus m2 V2i prime dot Vcm.</span> </p><p><span
  m='312710'>That represents this term and this term added together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='315920'>But recall that the center of mass reference
  frame</span> <span m='320360'>is defined by the condition that the total
  momentum</span> <span m='325280'>in that frame is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='328190'>So this term is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='333800'>And thus, we
  get that the kinetic energy in the ground</span> <span m='337640'>frame is
  equal to the kinetic energy</span> <span m='341780'>in the center of mass
  frame plus 1/2 m1 plus m2 times Vcm</span> <span m='349280'>squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='351050'>And that's how kinetic energy is in different
  reference frames.</span> </p><p><span m='356120'>And the next thing we'll look
  at is</span> <span m='357620'>how that changes when we have a
  collision.</span> </p>
