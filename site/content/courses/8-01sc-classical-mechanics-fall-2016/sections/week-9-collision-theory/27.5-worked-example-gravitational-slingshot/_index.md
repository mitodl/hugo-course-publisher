A spacecraft of mass \\(m1\\) with speed \\(v\_{1i} = 3v\_s\\), approaches Saturn which is moving in the opposite direction with speed \\(v\_s\\). After interacting gravitationally with Saturn, the spacecraft swings around Saturn and heads off in the opposite direction from its approach direction. The mass of Saturn is \\(m\_s\\), is much much larger than the mass of the spacecraft. Find the final speed, \\(v\_{1f}\\), of the spacecraft after it is far enough away from Saturn to be nearly free of the gravitational pull of Saturn.
