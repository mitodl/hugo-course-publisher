title: 27.5 Worked Example - Gravitational Slingshot
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3600'>Let's consider a gravitational slingshot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6780'>What is that?</span> </p><p><span m='8010'>Well, once in
  a while, people like to send spacecrafts out</span> <span m='12300'>into the
  solar system, particularly</span> <span m='14370'>the outer solar system, to
  explore what's going on there.</span> </p><p><span m='18620'>And because we
  can't on Earth give enough speed</span> <span m='22050'>to these little
  spacecrafts, we need the big planets around us</span> <span m='25770'>to help
  us a little.</span> </p><p><span m='27880'>And so we can consider a large
  planet like Jupiter or Saturn.</span> </p><p><span m='33030'>Here we have
  Saturn.</span> </p><p><span m='34860'>And if we have a little
  spacecraft</span> <span m='37290'>and we make it fly by close, then what
  actually happens</span> <span m='43110'>is it will, due to the gravitational
  attraction</span> <span m='46080'>of Saturn, acquire a kick in
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='49420'>And that is a gravitational
  slingshot.</span> </p><p><span m='51300'>So let's look at that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='53180'>So our little spacecraft comes in with an initial
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='58080'>And Saturn, of course, also has a
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='63180'>And once it has passed, our little
  spacecraft</span> <span m='67620'>will have a final velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='71430'>And in order to calculate what this final velocity is
  going</span> <span m='75030'>to be, what the increase in speed is going to
  be,</span> <span m='77850'>we need the concept of relative velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='85240'>And for that, we need to first consider some initial
  state.</span> </p><p><span m='90789'>So we have the relative velocity
  initially.</span> </p><p><span m='95690'>And that is the difference between
  those two velocities,</span> <span m='99400'>between the spacecraft and
  Saturn.</span> </p><p><span m='101811'>And what becomes very important
  here</span> <span m='103310'>is that we look at the coordinate system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='106420'>And keep that in mind.</span> </p><p><span
  m='107650'>Otherwise, we're going to get a few sign errors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='110650'>So the initial velocity of the spacecraft</span> <span
  m='115090'>goes in the i hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='117830'>And the
  velocity-- the relative velocity</span> <span m='119926'>is, of course, the
  difference, so</span> <span m='121300'>minus the velocity of Saturn.</span>
  </p><p><span m='124180'>But that one goes in the minus i hat direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='128240'>And then we have the final state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131710'>So V final relative.</span> </p><p><span m='134940'>And here we
  have the final velocity</span> <span m='137590'>of the spacecraft now going in
  the minus i hat</span> <span m='140170'>direction minus the velocity of
  Saturn</span> <span m='144040'>that also goes in the minus i hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='148520'>Now, there is one thing that we need
  to consider,</span> <span m='150910'>which is this velocity of Saturn.</span>
  </p><p><span m='153370'>This one actually is, of course, here,</span> <span
  m='155200'>the initial velocity of Saturn, and this one is the final
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='159220'>But because the mass of Saturn is</span>
  <span m='162190'>much larger than the mass of the spacecraft,</span> <span
  m='165730'>we can actually set the initial velocity of Saturn</span> <span
  m='169750'>to the final velocity of Saturn.</span> </p><p><span m='172460'>So
  we can turn this-- we can take this away here again,</span> <span
  m='177180'>and just consider one velocity of Saturn.</span> </p><p><span
  m='183040'>OK, good.</span> </p><p><span m='183830'>There's one more thing
  that we need in order to solve this,</span> <span m='186820'>because we need
  to know how the relative velocities are</span> <span m='190330'>actually
  related.</span> </p><p><span m='191860'>And the energy momentum law helps us
  there,</span> <span m='196780'>because that gives us that the initial relative
  velocity</span> <span m='200050'>equals minus the final relative
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='205000'>OK, so we can plug that in
  now.</span> </p><p><span m='207840'>What do we have here for the initial
  velocity?</span> </p><p><span m='211360'>We have Vi minus two i's gives us a
  plus the Saturn velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='219329'>And that equals--
  minus minus gives us a</span> <span m='223390'>plus-- the final velocity of
  the spacecraft.</span> </p><p><span m='227230'>And then we have three minuses
  here,</span> <span m='229180'>so that gives us a minus the Saturn
  velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='234760'>And we know from the problem that the
  initial velocity here</span> <span m='239890'>of the spacecraft was actually
  given</span> <span m='241750'>at three Saturn velocities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='244520'>So we can tally this up now.</span> </p><p><span m='245890'>We have
  three-- we have three plus one is four.</span> </p><p><span m='249820'>And
  we'll put this over on the other side.</span> </p><p><span m='251940'>That
  gives us five.</span> </p><p><span m='254310'>Five Saturn velocities equals
  our final velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='260170'>So that's quite a good
  gain, I would say.</span> </p><p><span m='264370'>And it nicely illustrates
  why big planets like Jupiter</span> <span m='268630'>and Saturn are really,
  really helpful for the exploration</span> <span m='271210'>of the solar
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='272980'>And that is actually how the New
  Horizons mission made it out</span> <span m='277480'>to Pluto, all the way out
  there.</span> </p>
