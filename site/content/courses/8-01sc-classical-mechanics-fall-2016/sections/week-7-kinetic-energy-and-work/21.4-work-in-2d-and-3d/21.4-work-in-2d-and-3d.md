transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3850'>So far we've defined work in one dimension.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6040'>But let's consider the path of a particle</span> <span
  m='8380'>in more than one dimension.</span> </p><p><span m='9520'>And on this
  screen it looks like a two-dimensional path,</span> <span m='12700'>and here's
  our particle.</span> </p><p><span m='14350'>And what we'd like to do is define
  the concept of work</span> <span m='16930'>for this type of path.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18640'>Now let's say that at this instant</span> <span
  m='20850'>our particle is experiencing a force F.</span> </p><p><span
  m='24820'>And the particle is being displaced by a distance, ds,</span> <span
  m='30190'>which is always tangent to the path.</span> </p><p><span
  m='33100'>And what we'd like to do now is talk about the work</span> <span
  m='35320'>done for this particle.</span> </p><p><span m='37450'>Now what we'd
  like to first say is</span> <span m='40450'>what we're going to do is imagine
  that we're</span> <span m='42820'>going to break the path down into a
  bunch</span> <span m='45970'>of small intervals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='51520'>And let's call this the j-th point</span> <span m='54370'>and the
  j-th plus 1 point.</span> </p><p><span m='56650'>Then our particle will start
  at j</span> <span m='59310'>and we'll displace it delta sj to the j-th</span>
  <span m='64120'>plus 1 position on the path.</span> </p><p><span m='66370'>And
  here, let's denote the force by Fj.</span> </p><p><span m='70960'>And now what
  we'd like to do is define the work</span> <span m='73060'>for this particular
  section.</span> </p><p><span m='75440'>Now our concept of work is the
  force</span> <span m='77910'>in the direction of the displacement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='79970'>So what I'd like to do is I'd like to define the
  quantity Fj,</span> <span m='85180'>and I put a little parentheses upstairs--
  parallel lines</span> <span m='89350'>upstairs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='90220'>This is the component of the force Fj</span> <span m='97720'>in the
  direction of delta sj.</span> </p><p><span m='103090'>Now the way we denote
  that is we can then</span> <span m='106840'>say that if I take the dot product
  of Fj dot delta sj,</span> <span m='114430'>this is the component of the
  force</span> <span m='118450'>in the direction of the motion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='120020'>Because remember, our dot product,</span> <span
  m='122090'>if we call this angle theta j, is</span> <span m='125170'>taking
  how much of one vector is in the direction</span> <span m='127330'>of the
  other times the magnitude of that displacement.</span> </p><p><span
  m='133150'>And again, when we write that component in our notation,</span>
  <span m='136570'>if we call this angle theta j, we</span> <span
  m='139000'>know that that's the magnitude of Fj times sine of-- cosine</span>
  <span m='145360'>of theta j.</span> </p><p><span m='150290'>Now because this
  is the amount of force</span> <span m='153350'>in the direction of the motion,
  that's</span> <span m='155420'>how we've defined work done.</span>
  </p><p><span m='157850'>And we'll symbolize the work done</span> <span
  m='160730'>in taking the particle from j to j plus 1 by the symbol Wj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='166460'>And now, this is a scalar quantity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='169160'>And when we want to find the total work, what</span>
  <span m='171500'>we have to add up is from some initial point</span> <span
  m='175100'>to some final point, how much work</span> <span m='178250'>is being
  done in taking our particle</span> <span m='180470'>from the initial position
  to the final position.</span> </p><p><span m='183590'>And it's just the sum
  for all of these j's, and let's say</span> <span m='187430'>we have n of them
  of Wj.</span> </p><p><span m='191180'>And right now we're going to call this
  W,</span> <span m='194200'>it's just that scalar sum, And, that's</span> <span
  m='196390'>equal to the sum j goes from 1 to n of Fj dot delta sj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='206030'>So now we'll use the vector dot product</span> <span
  m='208684'>because we already know that this is how much of the force</span>
  <span m='211100'>is in the direction of the motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='213650'>However, this answer depends on how fine we broke up this
  path.</span> </p><p><span m='219140'>And what we've seen many times now</span>
  <span m='221450'>is that the actual work that we want, let's write this as
  n</span> <span m='226040'>because it depends on the number of paths,</span>
  <span m='228380'>is the limit as n goes to infinity of this sum of
  scalar</span> <span m='236329'>amounts of work.</span> </p><p><span
  m='237920'>Now when we take that limit, as n goes to infinity,</span> <span
  m='243350'>of this sum, j equals 1 to n of Fj dot delta sj,</span> <span
  m='250640'>this quantity is formerly what we mean by a line integral.</span>
  </p><p><span m='256190'>And we denote that with a new notation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='259000'>We'll denote a line from our initial to final</span>
  <span m='262640'>and it's a dot product of the force dotted</span> <span
  m='267290'>into the small displacement.</span> </p><p><span m='270530'>Now
  whenever we see the dot product in an integral</span> <span m='274370'>that
  distinguishes it from a normal integral,</span> <span m='277970'>and this is
  what we call a line integral.</span> </p><p><span m='283130'>Now again, why
  did we switch from our delta s's to ds's?</span> </p><p><span
  m='287960'>Because when we take the limit, as n goes to infinity,</span> <span
  m='291890'>our grid becomes finer, and finer,</span> <span m='295070'>and
  finer until we're shrinking down to a point</span> <span m='299690'>where we
  can just talk about the differential displacement, ds,</span> <span
  m='303800'>and the force acting on a point.</span> </p><p><span m='306390'>And
  that's what our line integral is.</span> </p><p><span m='308870'>Now, what
  we'll learn next is how</span> <span m='311180'>to calculate this line
  integral for a number</span> <span m='313610'>of important physical examples
  that occur</span> <span m='316910'>in our interest in mechanics.</span> </p>
