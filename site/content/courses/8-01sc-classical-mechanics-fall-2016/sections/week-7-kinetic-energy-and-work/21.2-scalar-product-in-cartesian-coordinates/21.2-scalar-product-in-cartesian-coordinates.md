  <p><span m='3760'>We've so far described abstractly</span> <span m='5650'>what
  we mean by a dot product, by a definition of AB</span> <span m='10240'>equals
  the magnitude of A times cosine theta,</span> <span m='13720'>times the
  magnitude of B. But many times in physics problems,</span> <span m='17200'>we
  actually have vectors in space</span> <span m='19990'>and we want to see how
  to do this</span> <span m='22000'>in terms of a Cartesian or any coordinate
  system</span> <span m='24370'>in particular.</span> </p><p><span m='25570'>So
  let's set up a coordinate system, we'll call it</span> <span
  m='27670'>Cartesian, a and j.</span> </p><p><span m='30760'>And now this is
  very important.</span> </p><p><span m='32509'>Let's define a vector A here,
  and let's have another vector</span> <span m='36280'>in a completely different
  point, B. We still can take the dot</span> <span m='41200'>product of these
  two vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='43820'>But in order-- this is our plus x,
  plus y.</span> </p><p><span m='46570'>And I'm only doing things in two
  dimensions.</span> </p><p><span m='48970'>So how do we calculate the dot
  product?</span> </p><p><span m='51730'>Well, the first thing that we want to
  look at</span> <span m='54220'>is our unit vectors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56440'>What are the dot products of unit vectors?</span> </p><p><span
  m='58750'>Well, if we take i hat dot i hat, that's the magnitude of i</span>
  <span m='63250'>hat times cosine of the angle 0, times the magnitude of i
  hat.</span> </p><p><span m='69280'>And cosine of 0 is 1 and the magnitude of
  unit vectors</span> <span m='71920'>are 1.</span> </p><p><span m='72640'>So
  when you dot product the unit vector with itself, you get 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='76630'>And therefore, it's also true for the j hat. j</span>
  <span m='80080'>hat dot j hat is 1.</span> </p><p><span m='81610'>What happens
  when you dot product two vectors</span> <span m='83800'>that are
  perpendicular?</span> </p><p><span m='85330'>Well, in this case, this is 0
  because the angle theta</span> <span m='89800'>is 90 degrees.</span>
  </p><p><span m='91360'>And remember that cosine of 90 degrees is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='95530'>And anyway, when two vectors are perpendicular,</span>
  <span m='98590'>there's no component of one vector</span> <span
  m='100360'>that's parallel to the other.</span> </p><p><span m='102170'>So
  these are the essential facts that we're</span> <span m='104259'>going to need
  to calculate the dot product of two vectors that</span> <span m='107440'>are
  separated in space.</span> </p><p><span m='110350'>So the way we do that is
  we'll begin by drawing, writing down</span> <span m='114850'>the vectors in
  Cartesian coordinates, where</span> <span m='117910'>Ax A is a scalar and the
  vector part is and the unit vector.</span> </p><p><span m='121930'>And we have
  Ay j hat.</span> </p><p><span m='124450'>And likewise, we can write B as Bx i
  hat plus By j hat.</span> </p><p><span m='131530'>And now when we take the dot
  product of these two vectors,</span> <span m='136817'>we're going to write out
  all the terms</span> <span m='138400'>here so that you see them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='142100'>So here is our scalar or dot product.</span>
  </p><p><span m='145750'>We use those words interchangeably.</span>
  </p><p><span m='147890'>Now notice that we've already shown</span> <span
  m='151090'>that the dot product distributes over vector addition.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155380'>And also, if you multiply a scalar by a vector,</span>
  <span m='158710'>you can pull the scalar out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='160540'>So there's four terms here-- Ax i hat dot Bx i hat plus ax</span>
  <span m='170260'>i hat dot By j hat plus Ay j hat dot Bx i hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='180760'>This is a little tedious to write out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='183840'>By j hat.</span> </p><p><span m='185710'>And now
  because these are scalars,</span> <span m='187870'>we can pull them out and
  the only part of a dot product</span> <span m='191740'>that matters is how the
  unit vectors dot.</span> </p><p><span m='194800'>And that's why we have these
  two results.</span> </p><p><span m='196810'>i hat dot i hat is 1, j hat dot j
  hat is 1,</span> <span m='200200'>and i hat dot j hat is 0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='202030'>So the first turn is Ax Bx.</span> </p><p><span
  m='206770'>i hat dot j hat is 0, so we don't need that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='210970'>j hat dot i hat is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='214030'>And finally j
  hat dot j hat is 1.</span> </p><p><span m='217120'>And so we get plus Ay
  By.</span> </p><p><span m='222250'>And that's how we define the dot
  product</span> <span m='224950'>in Cartesian coordinates of two
  vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='227710'>Now, notice that if we dotted a
  vector,</span> <span m='230755'>A dot with itself, that would just be Ax Ax
  plus Ay Ay, which</span> <span m='240160'>is the components squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='244570'>And that's equal to the magnitude</span> <span
  m='246580'>of the vector squared.</span> </p><p><span m='249620'>And so we can
  say that the magnitude of the vector,</span> <span m='252430'>of any vector,
  is you take its dot product with itself.</span> </p><p><span m='257200'>You
  take the square root, but remember</span> <span m='259240'>we always take the
  positive square root, because magnitudes</span> <span m='262300'>are
  positive.</span> </p><p><span m='263500'>And that's how we calculate the
  scalar product for vectors.</span> </p><p><span m='267670'>And many times in
  the application of physics,</span> <span m='270490'>when we have physical
  quantities that</span> <span m='272170'>are vectors in different places, we
  use vector decomposition</span> <span m='275770'>and we use this
  procedure.</span> </p><p><span m='278980'>This is the Cartesian picture,
  we'll</span> <span m='280720'>learn how to do that in polar coordinates</span>
  <span m='282720'>when we need it later on.</span> </p><p></p>
