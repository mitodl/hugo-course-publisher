  <p><span m='3310'>We now would like to generalize our concept of work</span>
  <span m='5920'>to the motion of an object that goes</span> <span m='8650'>in
  more than one dimension.</span> </p><p><span m='10600'>And so, if we have our
  object here.</span> </p><p><span m='12970'>And we're applying a force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='15160'>And the object is moving.</span> </p><p><span
  m='17110'>And let's say the path is a little bit more complicated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='21800'>So our object, a little bit later, has moved.</span>
  </p><p><span m='25150'>And we're going to call that displacement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='28030'>We now want to generalize our concept</span> <span
  m='29800'>to work to handle this type of motion</span> <span m='32980'>in more
  than one dimension.</span> </p><p><span m='34900'>In order to do that, we'll
  need a new mathematical operation,</span> <span m='38720'>which we're going to
  call the scalar product.</span> </p><p><span m='42940'>So what I'd like to do
  first, is define</span> <span m='44890'>this in terms of vectors and
  then</span> <span m='46870'>we'll apply it to the concept of work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49300'>So suppose I have two vectors, a, and another vector,
  b.</span> </p><p><span m='55900'>And they're separated by an angle,
  theta.</span> </p><p><span m='59200'>And in this case, our theta, we're</span>
  <span m='62260'>going to just take it between 0 and pi.</span> </p><p><span
  m='67400'>Now, I'd like to talk about how much one vector projects</span>
  <span m='73600'>in the direction of the other.</span> </p><p><span
  m='76240'>So if I call this the parallel component of b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='81010'>Then I want to define a quantity which we're going to call</span>
  <span m='85060'>the scalar product of a dot b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='90580'>Which is the magnitude of a times</span> <span m='93729'>the amount
  of b that is in the direction parallel to a.</span> </p><p><span
  m='99940'>From our geometric diagram, you can</span> <span m='102490'>see that
  b parallel is equal to the magnitude of b</span> <span m='107830'>times the
  cosine of theta.</span> </p><p><span m='110979'>Remember, theta's going from 0
  to pi.</span> </p><p><span m='114530'>So this quantity, b parallel, can</span>
  <span m='116470'>both be positive or negative.</span> </p><p><span
  m='119180'>If theta is between 0 and pi/2, then in that range,</span> <span
  m='130478'>the cosine goes from 1 to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='133540'>And
  this quantity, b, will be greater or equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='139030'>b parallel.</span> </p><p><span m='140310'>If theta is going from
  pi/2, theta to pi,</span> <span m='147490'>then we have that b parallel is
  less than or equal to 0.</span> </p><p><span m='157120'>And, in particular, at
  the value pi/2,</span> <span m='160960'>b parallel is 0 because when theta is
  pi/2,</span> <span m='164880'>the b vector is completely perpendicular to
  a.</span> </p><p><span m='168466'>And this is what we're going to
  define</span> <span m='170320'>to be the scalar product.</span> </p><p><span
  m='172090'>But geometrically, we can also look at-- let's draw</span> <span
  m='176160'>our pictures again-- a and b.</span> </p><p><span m='180670'>Let's
  consider how much of the a is parallel to b.</span> </p><p><span m='186610'>So
  that's a parallel.</span> </p><p><span m='189950'>And if this is the angle
  theta, we</span> <span m='192460'>see that a parallel-- and I'll write
  it</span> <span m='197380'>as a parallel-- is the magnitude of a times cosine
  of theta.</span> </p><p><span m='203290'>And so, I can also define a dot
  b</span> <span m='207520'>as equal to how much of how much of a is
  parallel</span> <span m='213310'>to b times the magnitude of b.</span>
  </p><p><span m='217480'>In both of these instances, because b</span> <span
  m='220150'>parallel is the magnitude of b cosine theta,</span> <span
  m='224110'>and a parallel is a magnitude of a cosine theta, what we're</span>
  <span m='227500'>writing is that a dot b is the magnitude of a cosine
  theta</span> <span m='234820'>magnitude of b.</span> </p><p><span
  m='236890'>And now you can see that this quantity is a parallel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='242860'>And this quantity is b parallel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='247270'>And this is our geometric definition of a dot product.</span>
  </p><p><span m='253630'>One thing that we want to consider</span> <span
  m='256390'>are two important rules for dot products.</span> </p><p><span
  m='259620'>And they're the following.</span> </p><p><span m='262270'>That if
  we take a vector and multiply a by a quantity-- c,</span> <span
  m='269650'>here, is a scalar quantity-- then</span> <span m='273310'>this is
  equal to c times a dot b.</span> </p><p><span m='280720'>Geometrically, this
  is very easy to see.</span> </p><p><span m='283540'>Because if we draw a and
  we draw b.</span> </p><p><span m='289960'>And if I multiply a by a scalar, and
  let's make,</span> <span m='293350'>in this particular picture, our
  scalar</span> <span m='295540'>bigger than 1, then the new vector a is
  multiplied</span> <span m='300940'>by c and it's c times a.</span>
  </p><p><span m='304510'>The scalar product is just ca dot b, is the magnitude
  of ca</span> <span m='316500'>times how much of b is parallel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='318760'>And when you multiply this together,</span> <span
  m='321380'>you get c times a times to b parallel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='328360'>c of a dot b is equal to c times the magnitude of a times</span>
  <span m='337070'>b parallel.</span> </p><p><span m='339010'>And you can see
  that these two expressions are equal.</span> </p><p><span m='342730'>If you
  multiply a dot product by a scalar,</span> <span m='348370'>it satisfies this
  rule.</span> </p><p><span m='350740'>And there's one other crucial rule</span>
  <span m='353110'>that we'll need when we look at vectors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='355780'>That if you take a vector a and you add to it, a vector b,</span>
  <span m='363670'>and you dotted in a vector c, then</span> <span
  m='367160'>this is vector addition and multiplication.</span> </p><p><span
  m='372520'>This vector addition distributes over vector multiplication</span>
  <span m='377200'>by a dot c plus b dot c.</span> </p><p><span m='384040'>So
  these two facts are crucial to our development of vectors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='393310'>One thing that we can say is-- we'll</span> <span m='395560'>leave
  this as a little exercise for you to prove this result.</span> </p><p><span
  m='401920'>It's a pretty straightforward vector construction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='404920'>And to just give you a little bit of a hint.</span>
  </p><p><span m='407380'>If we have a vector a and another vector b</span>
  <span m='413800'>and we have a similar vector c, then</span> <span
  m='420070'>if I draw the vector a dot b plus b and I want</span> <span
  m='427960'>to take a dot c.</span> </p><p><span m='431980'>So I have how much
  of a is parallel to c.</span> </p><p><span m='436460'>And if I look at how
  much of b is parallel to c, then</span> <span m='440560'>as part of the
  exercise, make sure that you</span> <span m='443830'>can see that how much of
  a plus b parallel to c</span> <span m='448060'>agrees to this distributive
  rule.</span> </p><p><span m='450980'>So these are our definition of scalar
  product.</span> </p><p><span m='454540'>And the two key facts that we'll need
  when we apply it</span> <span m='459070'>in our example of work.</span>
