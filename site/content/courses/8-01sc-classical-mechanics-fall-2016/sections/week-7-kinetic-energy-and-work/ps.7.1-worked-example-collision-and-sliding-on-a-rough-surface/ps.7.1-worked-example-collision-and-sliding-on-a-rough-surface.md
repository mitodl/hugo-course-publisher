  <p><span m='4000'>Let's look at these two blocks here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6370'>Block 1 has a mass of 3m and Block 2 has a mass of 1 m.</span>
  </p><p><span m='11470'>And they're colliding and sticking together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='13870'>And then they're going to move in this direction</span>
  <span m='16239'>and eventually, slide onto this rough surface here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='20230'>What we want to figure out is, what</span> <span
  m='22480'>was that initial velocity v0 with which</span> <span m='26250'>the
  two blocks collided?</span> </p><p><span m='28990'>So up to this part here--
  before this x equals 0--</span> <span m='34450'>there's no external force
  acting on the system.</span> </p><p><span m='37750'>So conservation of
  momentum holds,</span> <span m='40510'>which means that p final equals p
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='47260'>So let's put this together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49240'>We're going to have 3m v0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='54260'>That block goes in the positive i hat direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56530'>Block 2 goes the opposite way, so we have m v0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='61550'>And then at the end, when they're stuck together</span> <span
  m='65830'>before here, we have to consider only this portion here</span> <span
  m='69280'>that pertains to a frictionless surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m='72220'>We have 4m v final.</span> </p><p><span m='76690'>And so the m's
  fall out.</span> </p><p><span m='79990'>This is 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='81230'>This is 4.</span> </p><p><span m='82630'>So we'll see that the final
  velocity is v0 half.</span> </p><p><span m='89440'>Now, in order to get to
  this v0, we also</span> <span m='93460'>have to consider energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='95650'>And in particular, we have to use the work energy
  principle</span> <span m='99009'>here, because this joint block is going to
  slide</span> <span m='103840'>onto this rough surface here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='105490'>So we can make use of the work energy
  principle,</span> <span m='108315'>as we know what the initial conditions are
  at this point</span> <span m='114100'>here, using the conservation of
  momentum</span> <span m='118900'>from here in the first place.</span>
  </p><p><span m='122090'>So we want to use work equals delta K, the work
  energy</span> <span m='126100'>principle.</span> </p><p><span m='127150'>Let's
  look at the work first.</span> </p><p><span m='130090'>Work is the integral of
  F dot dS.</span> </p><p><span m='136150'>And we're dealing with a
  one-dimensional problem</span> <span m='138520'>here, so we can just write Fx
  dx.</span> </p><p><span m='144040'>And we want to have this run from 0 to
  d.</span> </p><p><span m='149910'>I should say here that this block
  eventually</span> <span m='152380'>comes to rest at x equals d.</span>
  </p><p><span m='156460'>We're going to use that in a second.</span>
  </p><p><span m='159290'>So let's look at what this F is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='162760'>That's the frictional force here at work.</span> </p><p><span
  m='165850'>And actually, which direction does it go?</span> </p><p><span
  m='169870'>It opposes the motion fk.</span> </p><p><span m='176290'>So we're
  going to get a minus sign here, integral fk dx,</span> <span m='184630'>again
  going from x prime equals 0 to x prime equals d.</span> </p><p><span
  m='190600'>Now what is this fk ?We know that fk equals mu k N.</span>
  </p><p><span m='200090'>And from doing a quick free body diagram,</span> <span
  m='203230'>we'll see that we have 4mg going down,</span> <span m='207280'>and
  we have a normal force going up.</span> </p><p><span m='210670'>So we'll see
  that N equals 4mg, which we can then plug in here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='217060'>And then that goes over there.</span> </p><p><span m='218980'>And
  the coefficient of kinetic friction</span> <span m='221470'>is actually given
  to us.</span> </p><p><span m='222680'>So that nicely works out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='227140'>So we're going to have minus integral x prime 0, x
  prime</span> <span m='232560'>equals d, the coefficient first, b x squared,
  and then N 4mg dx.</span> </p><p><span m='245980'>If we integrate that, we're
  going to get minus 4bmg.</span> </p><p><span m='255820'>And we'll integrate
  this one, so that's x cubed over 3.</span> </p><p><span m='262970'>And we're
  going to plug in this value here,</span> <span m='264860'>so we're going to
  get a d, and that second term goes away.</span> </p><p><span m='268370'>So we
  are left with d cubed here.</span> </p><p><span m='271700'>So this is our
  work.</span> </p><p><span m='273430'>And now we need to look at the change in
  kinetic energy</span> <span m='278380'>between here and there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='280720'>We already know that this block is at rest at x equals
  d.</span> </p><p><span m='285580'>So if the velocity is 0, our kinetic energy
  will be 0,</span> <span m='290050'>and so our K final minus K initial</span>
  <span m='294720'>is going to be just minus initial.</span> </p><p><span
  m='298240'>And that's initial here, which is the final situation</span> <span
  m='301240'>of our collision.</span> </p><p><span m='302800'>So we're going to
  look at the combined block.</span> </p><p><span m='306170'>So we'll have minus
  1/2 and we have 4mv final squared.</span> </p><p><span m='314450'>We
  determined here already that the final velocity is</span> <span m='318550'>the
  initial 1/2, so have minus.</span> </p><p><span m='325030'>Here we're going to
  have 2m, and now v0 squared over 4.</span> </p><p><span m='332740'>And that
  actually gives us minus 1/2 m v0 squared.</span> </p><p><span m='348310'>OK,
  so now we can put this all together.</span> </p><p><span m='351610'>We apply
  this work energy principle.</span> </p><p><span m='353810'>So we're going to
  get minus 4/3 bmg d cubed</span> <span m='362080'>equals minus 1/2 m v0
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='368860'>We'll see that this and this and this
  and this goes.</span> </p><p><span m='374810'>And so we're going to get v0
  equals 8/3,</span> <span m='383230'>and then we have bgd cubed and the square
  root of that.</span> </p><p><span m='390640'>So this is our initial velocity
  with which the two blocks</span> <span m='394600'>collided initially, then
  eventually went</span> <span m='398110'>onto this rough surface and came to
  rest here at x equals d.</span> </p>
