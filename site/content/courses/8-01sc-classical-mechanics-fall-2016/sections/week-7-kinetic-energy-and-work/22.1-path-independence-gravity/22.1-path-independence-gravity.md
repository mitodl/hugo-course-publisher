title: 22.1 Path Independence - Gravity
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3610'>We will now like to explore a property of work done by
  forces</span> <span m='7120'>called path independence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='13300'>So recall that our work is defined</span> <span m='16650'>to be an
  integral of F.ds from some initial</span> <span m='20520'>to some final
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='21990'>Let's look at an example.</span>
  </p><p><span m='23209'>The force that we're going to look at</span> <span
  m='24750'>is the gravitational force.</span> </p><p><span m='26730'>And let's
  draw a coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='28470'>Let's take an initial
  point and a final point,</span> <span m='31860'>and let's choose plus x and
  plus y and our unit</span> <span m='35730'>vectors i-hat and j-hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='38850'>And in this example we're going to consider</span>
  <span m='41310'>the gravitational force near the surface of the earth, which
  is</span> <span m='44260'>a constant pointing downwards.</span> </p><p><span
  m='47430'>And what I'd like to do is consider two paths.</span> </p><p><span
  m='50340'>I'd like to consider a path, that first path goes straight</span>
  <span m='54420'>up and over.</span> </p><p><span m='57730'>So this will be
  path 1.</span> </p><p><span m='60270'>It has two legs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='62190'>And the second path, path 2 will go horizontal and vertical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='68760'>So that's going to be path 2, and it has two different
  legs.</span> </p><p><span m='72990'>And we'd like to evaluate this integral on
  both paths.</span> </p><p><span m='76650'>Now the way we do that is, first
  off, let's start with path 1.</span> </p><p><span m='82410'>We'll call this y
  initial and we'll call that y final.</span> </p><p><span m='87780'>And we'll
  draw the gravitational force mg, mg on both legs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='93509'>And now we see that when we do the integral</span> <span
  m='96180'>along this first leg of path 1, the gravitational force</span> <span
  m='99520'>is opposite the direction we're moving the displacement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='102720'>So the interval being negative, the force is
  constant.</span> </p><p><span m='105970'>And so the work done is simply minus
  mg times</span> <span m='110070'>delta y, which is y final minus y initial on
  that first part.</span> </p><p><span m='116370'>Now on the second part, this
  is a right angle.</span> </p><p><span m='119580'>And because it's a right
  angle the dot product is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='122160'>So that's the total
  work done on path 1.</span> </p><p><span m='125590'>Now on path 2, we'll
  again, let's just draw our forces.</span> </p><p><span m='129870'>We have
  gravity down and we have gravity down.</span> </p><p><span m='134460'>And we
  can see that, once again, on the first horizontal leg</span> <span
  m='137310'>of path 2 this integral is 0 because it's</span> <span
  m='142050'>moving perpendicular to the force, the direction of just</span>
  <span m='145950'>along the path.</span> </p><p><span m='147000'>And on this
  leg, just as on that leg</span> <span m='148860'>there, the gravitational
  force is down,</span> <span m='151440'>the integral is negative, we get
  exactly the same result.</span> </p><p><span m='156400'>Now what we'd like to
  do is consider a more general path</span> <span m='160260'>rather than these
  two horizontal and vertical legs.</span> </p><p><span m='164100'>So let's draw
  a coordinate system again.</span> </p><p><span m='167370'>Let's introduce i,
  and let's introduce f plus y and plus x.</span> </p><p><span m='173610'>And
  now let's consider a path which is moving like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='178840'>Now on this path, what we want to do</span> <span m='181020'>is
  break it down into horizontal and vertical pieces,</span> <span
  m='184740'>horizontal, vertical, horizontal, vertical,</span> <span
  m='186990'>horizontal, vertical, horizontal, vertical,</span> <span
  m='189240'>horizontal, vertical.</span> </p><p><span m='190740'>And let's
  focus on one of these pieces,</span> <span m='194250'>which has a
  displacement, ds, going from one</span> <span m='199170'>point to
  another.</span> </p><p><span m='201430'>Now if we blow that up, so we have our
  displacement,</span> <span m='205650'>ds, then what we have here is a
  displacement, dx,</span> <span m='213329'>in the horizontal direction and dy
  in the vertical direction.</span> </p><p><span m='219090'>And so we see again
  that when we compute this work,</span> <span m='223290'>and our gravitational
  force is downward, then</span> <span m='227430'>the horizontal display-- part
  of this displacement, the dot</span> <span m='230520'>product in the
  horizontal direction, 0,</span> <span m='233340'>only the vertical part
  cancels.</span> </p><p><span m='235470'>And so when we add up the work along
  these horizontal</span> <span m='239220'>and vertical pieces, only the
  vertical piece counts.</span> </p><p><span m='242250'>We're just adding up the
  dy's until we</span> <span m='245100'>get y final minus y initial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='248550'>Now let's be a little more analytic here and write
  out</span> <span m='251730'>our ds as a vector dx i-hat plus dy j-hat</span>
  <span m='259470'>and our gravitational force as minus mg j-hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='264810'>Now the work is the integral from the initial</span>
  <span m='268020'>to the final place of fg.ds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='273150'>And so when we do that we have minus mg j-hat</span> <span
  m='278760'>dot dx i-hat plus dy j-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='284460'>And from
  her initial to the final place.</span> </p><p><span m='287430'>And notice that
  we have j-hat dot i-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='290580'>They are perpendicular
  so that dot product is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='293130'>And j-hat dot j-hat
  is 1.</span> </p><p><span m='297490'>And so what we're left with here in the
  integral</span> <span m='299610'>is simply now we're integrating from y
  initial</span> <span m='302580'>to y final because we only have minus
  mgdy.</span> </p><p><span m='307560'>And that's what we said before, only the
  vertical parts are</span> <span m='310650'>adding up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='311850'>And so when you do this integral, mg is a constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='314720'>We get mg times y final minus y initial,</span> <span
  m='319680'>and that agrees with what we had before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='323350'>So this type of force is an illustration</span> <span m='326820'>of
  a force where the work done is</span> <span m='329670'>independent of the path
  we choose from the initial</span> <span m='332520'>to the final place.</span>
