  <p><span m='3540'>We consider the work done by a gravitational force,
  which</span> <span m='7150'>was path-independent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8070'>Now let's generalize that to any force between two points,</span>
  <span m='12444'>i, and another point, f, that if the work done</span> <span
  m='20460'>going from the initial point to the final point--</span> <span
  m='23550'>this is path-independent-- then we call this</span> <span
  m='28680'>force a conservative force.</span> </p><p><span m='38934'>There are
  many conservative forces</span> <span m='40350'>that we'll analyze in this
  class.</span> </p><p><span m='42600'>Examples will be the inverse square,
  electric force,</span> <span m='45540'>or the gravitational force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='47250'>We've already seen gravitational force.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49504'>Near the surface of the Earth is conservative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='51420'>Spring forces are other examples of conservative
  forces.</span> </p><p><span m='53880'>But let's look a little bit in
  detail.</span> </p><p><span m='56820'>Suppose we call this path 1 and
  we</span> <span m='61020'>consider a second path, path 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='65000'>Then a property of conservative forces</span> <span m='67590'>is
  that the work done is independent of that path.</span> </p><p><span
  m='71740'>So if we total up the work from the initial</span> <span
  m='75720'>to final on path 1 of f dot ds.</span> </p><p><span m='82560'>And
  then we go from the final point</span> <span m='85590'>to the initial point on
  path 2 of f dot ds.</span> </p><p><span m='91800'>Then because these intervals
  are independent of the path,</span> <span m='95550'>and all we've done is
  shifted the endpoints, we get 0.</span> </p><p><span m='100229'>And that's the
  statement.</span> </p><p><span m='101850'>And we'll write w conservative here
  for conservative forces.</span> </p><p><span m='106620'>So we're going to call
  this force conservative</span> <span m='109500'>if it's
  path-independent.</span> </p><p><span m='111090'>So what we have here is the
  statement</span> <span m='113310'>that the work done by a conservative
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='116550'>Now what we'll do here, is indicate a
  circle</span> <span m='120120'>by a closed path.</span> </p><p><span
  m='122640'>The work done by conservative force on a closed path is
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='127350'>What does a closed path look like?</span>
  </p><p><span m='129490'>Well, remember, what we did was we went from 1, but
  then</span> <span m='133470'>instead of going in this direction,</span> <span
  m='135840'>we came back on path to, from the final,</span> <span m='139680'>to
  the initial point.</span> </p><p><span m='141120'>And if the force is
  conservative,</span> <span m='142950'>the work done around a closed path is
  0.</span> </p>
