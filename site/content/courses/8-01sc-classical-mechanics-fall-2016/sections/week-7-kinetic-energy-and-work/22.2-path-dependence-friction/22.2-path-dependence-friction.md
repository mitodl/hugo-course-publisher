  <p><span m='3670'>Let's now explore an example of a force in which the work
  done</span> <span m='6970'>it is not path independent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='9710'>And the classic example is the friction force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='12080'>So let's consider the following setup.</span> </p><p><span
  m='14650'>Suppose we have a horizontal surface with friction</span> <span
  m='18130'>and we have an object.</span> </p><p><span m='20080'>And we're
  moving this object.</span> </p><p><span m='21470'>So let's choose an
  origin.</span> </p><p><span m='23170'>We'll call this plus x, our i hat
  direction,</span> <span m='26470'>it's all going to be one-dimensional
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='28510'>And we're going to move this object from
  an initial</span> <span m='31540'>to a final state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='32960'>And were going to move it directly</span> <span m='35110'>in a
  straight line from the initial to the final state.</span> </p><p><span
  m='38020'>And this will be our path 1.</span> </p><p><span m='40660'>And in
  our second case, what we'd</span> <span m='42130'>like to contrast with that,
  is that we'd</span> <span m='44430'>like to move the object out to a point
  xa</span> <span m='50200'>and then back to the final point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='54520'>So this is our path 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='57340'>Has two legs.</span> </p><p><span m='59650'>And we'd like to compare
  the work done on these two paths.</span> </p><p><span m='63070'>So for path 1
  we'll begin by calculating-- our force here</span> <span m='67930'>is the
  kinetic friction force.</span> </p><p><span m='70930'>And the kinetic friction
  force remember is, in this case,</span> <span m='74900'>it's going to oppose
  the motion.</span> </p><p><span m='77140'>So we have force kinetic for path
  1,</span> <span m='81039'>and that is minus mu k mg in the i-hat
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='88910'>And so when we do the integral for
  the work</span> <span m='91870'>from x initial to x final, this is path
  1,</span> <span m='97660'>then we have minus mu k mg i-hat dotted into--
  Now</span> <span m='104080'>what is the ds for this path?</span> </p><p><span
  m='106330'>It's simply dx i-hat, so dx i-hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='110550'>Notice we're not putting any sign into dx.</span> </p><p><span
  m='115810'>The sign will show up in terms of our end</span> <span
  m='118780'>points of our integral.</span> </p><p><span m='120260'>So we do the
  dot product here, we</span> <span m='121660'>have i-hat dot i-hat, that's
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='125320'>And so this interval, we can pull out all
  the constants,</span> <span m='128550'>mu k mg.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131140'>We're just integrating dx from x initial to x final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='135280'>And so we get mu k mg times x final minus x
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='142480'>Now for path 2 we have two separate
  integrals.</span> </p><p><span m='145910'>So for path 2 we'll just show the
  first part</span> <span m='150730'>where we're going from x initial to
  xa.</span> </p><p><span m='154270'>Then the friction force is opposing the
  motion.</span> </p><p><span m='159820'>And we always just write dx in terms of
  the coordinate system,</span> <span m='163810'>dx i-hat because you'll see
  that the signs show up in the end</span> <span m='168910'>points of the
  integral.</span> </p><p><span m='170140'>And then when we're coming
  back--</span> <span m='172660'>I'll put that in a different color and I'll put
  it below it.</span> </p><p><span m='176890'>So when we come back, notice the
  friction force</span> <span m='180400'>is going to change direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='183960'>ds will still be written that way</span> <span
  m='186160'>but pay close attention to the end points of the integral.</span>
  </p><p><span m='189820'>So now what we have is two integrals.</span>
  </p><p><span m='191960'>So W is the integral from x initial to xa.</span>
  </p><p><span m='196990'>And now I'm going to take the dot products here
  directly.</span> </p><p><span m='200050'>It's the same friction force, we
  still</span> <span m='202390'>have this same integral, which is minus mu k mg
  dx.</span> </p><p><span m='209170'>Now here's where it's a little bit
  tricky.</span> </p><p><span m='211750'>Notice on this path fk is plus mu k mg
  i-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='220480'>And so when we dotted into dx we have a
  plus sign,</span> <span m='225730'>we'll just continue that integration
  here,</span> <span m='228430'>of mu k mg dx from xa to x final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='236841'>Both of these integrals are straightforward
  integrals</span> <span m='239050'>to do.</span> </p><p><span m='239550'>This
  is minus mu k mg xa minus x initial.</span> </p><p><span m='247030'>And over
  here, we have a plus mu k mg x final minus x initial.</span> </p><p><span
  m='255310'>Notice x final minus xa, rather, is negative.</span> </p><p><span
  m='260120'>And so both of these integrals are negative, as we expect.</span>
  </p><p><span m='263650'>And so what we see here is that we have two
  pieces,</span> <span m='267280'>so minus 2 mu k mg xa.</span> </p><p><span
  m='272230'>And then we have that other piece, mu k mg</span> <span
  m='276476'>x final minus x initial.</span> </p><p><span m='280750'>Hang on,
  this is actually a plus sign.</span> </p><p><span m='292970'>So our answer is
  very different because the</span> <span m='295740'>displaced the amount that
  we've traveled is different.</span> </p><p><span m='299860'>So what we see
  here is an example of a force which</span> <span m='303520'>is the work done
  is not path independent</span> <span m='307500'>but depends on the path taken
  from the initial</span> <span m='310330'>to the final states.</span>
