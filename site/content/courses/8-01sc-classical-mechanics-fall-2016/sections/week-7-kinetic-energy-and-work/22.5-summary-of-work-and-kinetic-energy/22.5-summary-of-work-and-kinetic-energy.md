  <p><span m='3360'>Let's review what we've done this week.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5460'>We've seen that the work done by a force along a trajectory</span>
  <span m='11400'>from point A to point B can be written</span> <span
  m='13800'>as the integral of the dot product of that force,</span> <span
  m='20705'>with the displacement going from point A</span> <span m='24130'>to
  point B, where we note that this integral, in general,</span> <span
  m='29410'>must be evaluated over the particular path taken</span> <span
  m='32530'>from point A to point B. This is called a line</span> <span
  m='35050'>integral or a path integral.</span> </p><p><span m='36430'>And
  again, I want to emphasize the value</span> <span m='38950'>of this integral
  depends, in general, on the path taken</span> <span m='42070'>from point A to
  point B. And you could understand</span> <span m='44740'>that if you
  considered the fact that, in general, the force is</span> <span m='47800'>a
  function of position.</span> </p><p><span m='49240'>And so if you go along
  different paths,</span> <span m='51880'>the dot product of the force with a
  particular path</span> <span m='55600'>may be different, even though you're
  going</span> <span m='57490'>between the same end points.</span> </p><p><span
  m='59870'>Now, the reason that the work is a useful concept</span> <span
  m='63730'>is that it allows us to understand</span> <span m='65590'>how the
  kinetic energy of an object-- so the kinetic energy</span> <span m='75789'>is
  1/2mv squared.</span> </p><p><span m='77600'>The work allows us to understand
  how the kinetic energy evolves</span> <span m='80620'>under the action of a
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='82240'>And we see that through what's called the
  work-kinetic energy</span> <span m='86530'>theorem, which states that the work
  done-- so again,</span> <span m='96620'>the integral of F dot ds from point
  A</span> <span m='100820'>to point B, evaluated along the specific
  path--</span> <span m='106940'>is equal to the change in the kinetic
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='109070'>So that's 1/2mvB squared, since
  B</span> <span m='114020'>is the final point, minus 1/2mvA squared,</span>
  <span m='119930'>where A is the initial point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='122030'>And this is equal to the change in the kinetic energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='130680'>And we derived this theorem from Newton's second
  law,</span> <span m='133980'>F equals ma.</span> </p><p><span m='134670'>So
  this is essentially just a restatement</span> <span m='136950'>of Newton's
  second law.</span> </p><p><span m='139390'>Now, two things to note about the
  work and this work</span> <span m='142350'>integral-- the first is that the
  work integral, when evaluated,</span> <span m='147445'>it just gives a number,
  because a dot product is a scalar.</span> </p><p><span m='151710'>And that
  number can be either positive, or negative,</span> <span m='155130'>or even
  zero, depending upon whether the velocity increases,</span> <span
  m='160000'>decreases, or stays the same under the action of the force,</span>
  <span m='162930'>as you go from point A to point B.</span> </p><p><span
  m='166110'>The second point to emphasize is that, again,</span> <span
  m='169320'>this integral, in general, must be evaluated</span> <span
  m='172770'>along the specific path taken from point A</span> <span
  m='175710'>to point B, which means that in order to evaluate the
  integral,</span> <span m='178980'>we need to know what that path is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='181050'>Now, if we have a situation where we don't know in
  advance</span> <span m='183720'>what the path is, then we can't evaluate the
  integral.</span> </p><p><span m='186130'>So in a way, it might seem like a not
  very useful concept,</span> <span m='190579'>that we haven't really made
  progress,</span> <span m='192120'>because we need to know the answer about
  what</span> <span m='193995'>the trajectory is before we can calculate the
  work done.</span> </p><p><span m='196350'>And it's not clear why that's
  useful.</span> </p><p><span m='199960'>However, what I want to point
  out</span> <span m='201360'>is that there are two special cases that</span>
  <span m='203640'>are particularly useful.</span> </p><p><span m='211210'>The
  first special case is that of constrained motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='214890'>Sometimes we know in advance what the path is going to be,</span>
  <span m='226160'>because the motion is constrained.</span> </p><p><span
  m='228070'>We know that it's going to be moving along--</span> <span
  m='230091'>the object is going to be moving along a circular path</span> <span
  m='232340'>or along some particular track of some particular shape.</span>
  </p><p><span m='236060'>And as long as we can describe that trajectory,</span>
  <span m='239870'>we can evaluate our work integral along that
  trajectory.</span> </p><p><span m='243900'>So that's a case where even though
  the work is</span> <span m='246790'>a path-dependent integral, we know the
  path,</span> <span m='249080'>and so we can evaluate the integral.</span>
  </p><p><span m='251670'>The second special case we've seen</span> <span
  m='254480'>is that there is a special class of forces</span> <span
  m='256399'>called conservative forces.</span> </p><p><span m='265560'>And
  conservative forces have the property that the work integral</span> <span
  m='269230'>is independent of the path.</span> </p><p><span m='271000'>So for a
  conservative force, to work integral only depends</span> <span m='278650'>upon
  the endpoints A and B, and not upon the path</span> <span m='282790'>you take
  to get from A to B. So for any path,</span> <span m='285970'>you'll always get
  the same value of the work integral</span> <span m='288880'>if the force is
  conservative.</span> </p><p><span m='291105'>OK, so those are the two cases in
  which</span> <span m='293200'>we can usefully apply work and the work-energy
  theorem.</span> </p><p><span m='299950'>Now in general, one might have a
  combination</span> <span m='303460'>of conservative and non-conservative
  forces</span> <span m='305710'>acting on a system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='307070'>And in that case, we can actually</span> <span m='310060'>write the
  work as consisting of two separate terms.</span> </p><p><span m='315220'>The
  work done by conservative forces, what I'll write as Wc,</span> <span
  m='320440'>plus the work done by the non-conservative forces, Wnc.</span>
  </p><p><span m='325810'>And so the conservative work is just</span> <span
  m='328630'>the work integral evaluated for the conservative forces,</span>
  <span m='332840'>so Fc, for conservative force, dot ds, going from A to
  B.</span> </p><p><span m='340659'>And because this force is
  conservative,</span> <span m='343659'>this integral is path
  independent.</span> </p><p><span m='347260'>Let me emphasize that here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='348520'>This is a path-independent integral.</span>
  </p><p><span m='352659'>It's not a line integral.</span> </p><p><span
  m='353790'>It only depends upon the endpoints,</span> <span m='356590'>because
  the force is conservative.</span> </p><p><span m='359050'>The second term is
  the non-conservative work.</span> </p><p><span m='362230'>And that is the work
  done by the non-conservative force, F sub</span> <span m='366700'>mc, dotted
  with ds, between the same end points, A and B.</span> </p><p><span
  m='372850'>But this integral does depend upon the specific path.</span>
  </p><p><span m='377890'>The path matters for this term, because there the
  force</span> <span m='380710'>is non-conservatives.</span> </p><p><span
  m='381910'>So in general, you can compute the work</span> <span m='385000'>by
  separating out the conservative force</span> <span m='389304'>and the
  non-conservative force acting on the system,</span> <span m='391470'>if both
  are acting.</span> </p><p><span m='393010'>If the force is only
  conservative,</span> <span m='394786'>then you only have to worry about</span>
  <span m='396159'>the path-independent integral, which in general is</span>
  <span m='398560'>much simpler to evaluate.</span> </p><p><span m='400900'>If
  the force is non-conservative,</span> <span m='402340'>then you need to
  specify the path in order</span> <span m='405100'>to evaluate the
  integral.</span> </p><p><span m='408400'>Again, a path-dependent integral is
  often</span> <span m='411520'>called a path integral or a line
  integral.</span> </p><p></p>
