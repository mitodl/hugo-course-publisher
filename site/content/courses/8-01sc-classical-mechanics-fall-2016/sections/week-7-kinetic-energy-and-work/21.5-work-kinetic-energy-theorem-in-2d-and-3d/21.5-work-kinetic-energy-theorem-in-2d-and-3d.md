  <p><span m='3690'>We will now like to generalize the work energy
  theorem</span> <span m='6660'>to more than one dimension.</span> </p><p><span
  m='8490'>Remember that we defined our work as an integral</span> <span
  m='11850'>from a to b of a force dot ds.</span> </p><p><span m='17130'>And
  graphically let's look at that.</span> </p><p><span m='20370'>If we start at A
  and we go to a point B, ,</span> <span m='24450'>and if at some point on this
  path we have a force F,</span> <span m='29310'>and the displacement is always
  tangent to the force</span> <span m='32640'>for an object M, we would like to
  now figure out how this</span> <span m='37740'>integral is related to the
  change in kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='41100'>So first off, it's
  always important</span> <span m='44610'>when analyzing a new result to
  understand where</span> <span m='47430'>Newton's second law comes in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='49230'>And for our point particle Newton's second law</span>
  <span m='51870'>is that the force is equal to ma,</span> <span m='54750'>which
  we can write as mass times the derivative of the velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='60930'>And so our first step is to rewrite the work integral</span> <span
  m='65250'>and now to incorporate Newton's second law into this
  integral.</span> </p><p><span m='70320'>So this is no longer simply a concept
  of physics</span> <span m='75690'>but it's combining the second law and our
  definition of work.</span> </p><p><span m='80110'>Now what I'd like to do here
  is to note</span> <span m='82530'>that the displacement of a particle</span>
  <span m='86460'>is always equal to the velocity times dt.</span> </p><p><span
  m='90160'>So if we put that result in here, AB of M dv dt dot v dt,</span>
  <span m='100500'>you can see that we can cancel dt's, which is
  essentially</span> <span m='105539'>taking the time out of this
  integral</span> <span m='108450'>and writing the work entirely in terms</span>
  <span m='111479'>of the small change in velocity, dv, scalar product</span>
  <span m='116910'>with the velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='118500'>And this is
  the quantity we would now like to calculate.</span> </p><p><span m='122220'>So
  one way, when we ever want to calculate these dot products,</span> <span
  m='126120'>we choose a coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span m='128050'>So
  let's choose a Cartesian coordinate system,</span> <span m='130470'>plus x
  plus y, with our unit vectors i-hat and j-hat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='137320'>Now our task is to write down these various vectors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='141329'>So for instance, dv can be written</span> <span
  m='145410'>as dv x i-hat plus dv y j-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='152100'>Now
  if we were to go into three dimensions</span> <span m='154470'>we would have
  dv z k-hat but I'm just</span> <span m='156780'>going to do this in two
  dimensions.</span> </p><p><span m='159090'>Similarly, the velocity is vx i-hat
  plus vy j-hat.</span> </p><p><span m='166250'>And now when we take the dot
  product,</span> <span m='169050'>as we've learned in Cartesian
  coordinates,</span> <span m='171490'>it's just the components dv x vx,</span>
  <span m='175710'>and I'll just do a little parentheses there,</span> <span
  m='177750'>plus dv y vy.</span> </p><p><span m='182580'>And so now, our work
  integral, AB,</span> <span m='190320'>is equal to the mass times dv x vx plus
  the mass times dv y vy.</span> </p><p><span m='204450'>Now what we have here
  is to a sum in the [? integrant. ?]</span> <span m='211320'>But by the rules
  of integration we</span> <span m='213750'>can rewrite this integral as two
  separate integrals from A</span> <span m='218250'>to B of M dv x vx and from A
  to B of M dv y vy.</span> </p><p><span m='230370'>And now we can integrate
  each of these separately.</span> </p><p><span m='232850'>And if you recall, in
  one dimension</span> <span m='235530'>we used our integral formula, this is
  just vx squared.</span> </p><p><span m='239820'>And when we integrate them
  what we have to look at</span> <span m='243330'>is the end points of our
  integral.</span> </p><p><span m='246300'>What we're integrating is a
  velocity,</span> <span m='248590'>and we're going from some initial
  value</span> <span m='250290'>to some final value.</span> </p><p><span
  m='251910'>So our first integral simply becomes M vx final squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='258980'>I'll pull out the factor 2 minus vx initial squared,
  where A vx</span> <span m='267570'>initial is the initial x component velocity
  of A</span> <span m='270990'>in vx final is the final component of B.</span>
  </p><p><span m='273840'>And I have a similar term here, which</span> <span
  m='276330'>is vy final squared minus the vy initial squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='282490'>And when I combine our terms, vx final</span> <span
  m='287100'>squared plus vy final squared minus one-half M</span> <span
  m='293960'>vx initial squared plus vy initial squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='300280'>We've already shown that our kinetic energy, 1/2 M v</span> <span
  m='307016'>dot v is 1/2 M vx squared plus vy squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='313660'>And so we see that this is just the final kinetic energy</span>
  <span m='319110'>minus the initial kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='323040'>And so we can call that delta k.</span> </p><p><span m='327450'>And
  what we have now is the work energy theorem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='331050'>And I'll come back to my original statement</span> <span
  m='333600'>that the work is equal to the change in kinetic energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='340810'>And this is a combination of our definition of
  work</span> <span m='343590'>and Newton's second law.</span> </p><p></p>
