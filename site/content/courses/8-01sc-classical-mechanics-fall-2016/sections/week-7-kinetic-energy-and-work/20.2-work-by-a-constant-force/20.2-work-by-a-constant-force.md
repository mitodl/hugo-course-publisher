title: 20.2 Work by a Constant Force
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4300'>Suppose we have an object and we're</span> <span
  m='7060'>applying a constant force in the horizontal direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='11680'>We would now like to introduce the concept of
  work.</span> </p><p><span m='15640'>Suppose our force starts at a point
  xi,</span> <span m='20410'>and goes to a position x final, and we'll</span>
  <span m='23500'>call this the i hat direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='26020'>Then our force as a vector, we'll write Fx i hat.</span>
  </p><p><span m='31270'>And now what we'd like to calculate</span> <span
  m='33310'>is the product of force with the displacement of the object.</span>
  </p><p><span m='37810'>So our displacement vector, delta x,</span> <span
  m='41170'>is equal to delta x i hat, where delta x is equal to x</span> <span
  m='47530'>final minus x initial.</span> </p><p><span m='50470'>And for our
  constant force for the case</span> <span m='54070'>where Fx is a constant, we
  would like</span> <span m='57970'>to define the work done by this force</span>
  <span m='61090'>in displacing the object from our initial position,</span>
  <span m='64599'>and we'll mark it like that.</span> </p><p><span m='66850'>To
  the final position here is given by the product,</span> <span m='72850'>so
  we'll call work is the product of the force</span> <span m='78370'>Fx times
  the displacement.</span> </p><p><span m='81430'>And so that's equal to Fx
  times x final minus x initial.</span> </p><p><span m='87789'>And this is our
  definition for work for the special case where</span> <span m='91539'>the
  force is constant.</span> </p><p><span m='94720'>Now, if we look at this, our
  force may-- in our diagram,</span> <span m='100120'>we drew it in the positive
  x direction.</span> </p><p><span m='102550'>But if our force Fx were less than
  0,</span> <span m='107800'>and our displacement was in the positive
  direction,</span> <span m='110860'>positive, then you can see that the work is
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='115850'>So if the force is opposing the
  displacement,</span> <span m='119410'>and that's what would happen if
  Fx</span> <span m='121150'>was pointing in the negative direction,</span>
  <span m='123130'>the work would be negative.</span> </p><p><span m='125290'>If
  Fx is positive and the displacement is positive,</span> <span m='130610'>then
  the work is positive.</span> </p><p><span m='132700'>So we see work is a
  scalar that has assigned</span> <span m='137590'>quantity, positive or
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='139810'>Now, whenever we introduce a new
  quantity,</span> <span m='141730'>we always have to be a little bit careful
  about the units.</span> </p><p><span m='144400'>Since work is the product of
  force and distance,</span> <span m='147579'>then our SI units for work are the
  units</span> <span m='153970'>of force, which are newtons, times the units of
  distance,</span> <span m='157870'>meters.</span> </p><p><span m='158800'>And
  we call this a joule.</span> </p><p><span m='162250'>So one joule is equal to
  one newton meter.</span> </p><p><span m='165450'>Now graphically, we can make
  an interpretation of this.</span> </p><p><span m='169100'>Let's draw a graph
  of force, the x component of the force.</span> </p><p><span m='175630'>And
  here if we had some origin, we'll have x.</span> </p><p><span m='180100'>And
  our object is starting at xi and it's going to x final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='185320'>And throughout this process, we're</span> <span m='187210'>assuming
  that the force is constant.</span> </p><p><span m='192290'>So what we see in
  this diagram here,</span> <span m='194470'>I'll just shade in this area, that
  our work, which</span> <span m='199420'>was the product of force times the
  displacement,</span> <span m='203440'>corresponds to the area here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='208520'>So we have a geometric interpretation of work</span>
  <span m='212050'>as the area under the force versus position graph.</span>
  </p><p><span m='216520'>And this is our example of work for a constant
  force.</span> </p>
