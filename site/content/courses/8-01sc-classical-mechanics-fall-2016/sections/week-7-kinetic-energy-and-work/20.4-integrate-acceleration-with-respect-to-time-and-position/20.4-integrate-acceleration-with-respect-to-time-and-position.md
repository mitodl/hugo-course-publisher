title: 20.4 Integrate Acceleration with Respect to Time and Position
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='4130'>I'd like to now show you two mathematical facts about how
  we</span> <span m='7580'>integrate quantities of motion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='10070'>Suppose we have an object, let's call this the i hat
  direction,</span> <span m='13050'>and it's moving, and it has an x component
  of velocity.</span> </p><p><span m='17120'>And suppose it starts at some
  initial position</span> <span m='19910'>and goes at some final
  position.</span> </p><p><span m='22070'>And in the initial position, it was at
  time ti,</span> <span m='26150'>and the final position was at t final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='28910'>Now, we have two very important integrals</span> <span
  m='31190'>that we want to look at which govern how we describe,</span> <span
  m='35060'>how we integrate acceleration with respect to time,</span> <span
  m='39020'>and also how we'll integrate acceleration</span> <span
  m='41390'>with respect to space.</span> </p><p><span m='43620'>Now, recall
  that our acceleration, which</span> <span m='47270'>may be a function of time,
  is the derivative</span> <span m='50570'>of the x component of velocity with
  respect to time.</span> </p><p><span m='54390'>So, let's first look at a
  simple integration</span> <span m='56570'>of acceleration with respect to time
  and see what we get.</span> </p><p><span m='60420'>So, if we integrate
  acceleration,</span> <span m='61965'>now I'm going to introduce an integration
  variable, dt prime.</span> </p><p><span m='65780'>And our integration variable
  goes from our initial time</span> <span m='69770'>to some final time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='72980'>And if we use our fact that acceleration</span> <span
  m='75650'>is the derivative of the velocity,</span> <span m='78080'>then we
  can write this is dvx, dt prime, dt prime again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='84410'>After a while I'll drop the dummy variables</span> <span
  m='87680'>and the endpoints of the integral.</span> </p><p><span m='89150'>And
  this simply becomes the integral</span> <span m='91550'>from t prime, t
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='93520'>t prime equals t final of dvx
  prime.</span> </p><p><span m='98509'>Now notice we've done a change of
  variables</span> <span m='101539'>in the integration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='102780'>So instead of now talking about the endpoints</span> <span
  m='105140'>of the integral from t prime, t initial</span> <span m='107570'>to
  t final, now what we're doing is we changed our integration</span> <span
  m='112340'>variable.</span> </p><p><span m='113720'>And so what we have is, we
  have the velocity integration</span> <span m='117680'>variable is going from
  some initial value.</span> </p><p><span m='122000'>And that integration
  variable is going to some final value.</span> </p><p><span m='125900'>So
  again, our initial conditions may</span> <span m='128240'>have some initial
  velocity and some final velocity--</span> <span m='132830'>three different
  ways of describing</span> <span m='134840'>the initial and final
  states.</span> </p><p><span m='136460'>This integral is a very straightforward
  integral,</span> <span m='139160'>the x final minus vx initial, which</span>
  <span m='142820'>is the change in the x component of the velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='146100'>And that's our classic result that we've</span> <span
  m='147800'>done that the integration of acceleration</span> <span
  m='150079'>with respect to time is a change in velocity.</span> </p><p><span
  m='153010'>Now, let's see what happens as a comparison</span> <span
  m='156290'>when we integrate our acceleration not with respect</span> <span
  m='159680'>to time, but suppose that it's a function of space.</span>
  </p><p><span m='164820'>And so now we're integrating again.</span>
  </p><p><span m='166889'>We have a dummy variable.</span> </p><p><span
  m='167930'>We have to be careful, because this</span> <span m='169388'>is the
  x component of acceleration,</span> <span m='171260'>but x prime is our
  integration variable,</span> <span m='174410'>and that's going from some
  initial position</span> <span m='176930'>to some final position.</span>
  </p><p><span m='179670'>Now, we can write this as again, make the
  substitution,</span> <span m='184370'>dx dt, dx prime, going from the initial
  to the final.</span> </p><p><span m='190970'>But now notice we're going to
  rewrite this integrand as dvx</span> <span m='195980'>times dx prime, dt
  prime, dt.</span> </p><p><span m='200900'>And when we do that, we have this
  result that dx prime,</span> <span m='207079'>dt prime is precisely what we
  mean by vx.</span> </p><p><span m='210320'>Now, I'll introduce some dummy
  variables there as well.</span> </p><p><span m='215270'>So what our integrand
  becomes is dvx prime, vx prime.</span> </p><p><span m='221910'>That's not a
  function, it's a product</span> <span m='223880'>of a differential times vx
  prime.</span> </p><p><span m='227510'>And now our new integration
  variable</span> <span m='230300'>is going from some initial value to some
  final value.</span> </p><p><span m='236450'>Once again, this is a
  straightforward integral.</span> </p><p><span m='239000'>For those who haven't
  seen integrals like this,</span> <span m='240980'>it's just something like x
  dx is x squared over 2,</span> <span m='245220'>but our integration variable
  is vx prime.</span> </p><p><span m='247640'>So what we get is 1/2 vx final
  squared</span> <span m='251900'>minus vx initial squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='255530'>And so what we see here is two fundamentally different facts</span>
  <span m='260329'>that if you integrate acceleration</span> <span
  m='261890'>with respect to time, you get the change in velocity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='265740'>But if you integrate acceleration</span> <span
  m='267560'>with respect to space, you get 1/2 times the change</span> <span
  m='271370'>not of velocity, but of the x component</span> <span m='273950'>of
  the velocity squared.</span> </p><p><span m='275870'>And both of these facts
  are central to how</span> <span m='278990'>we'll analyze the concept of
  work</span> <span m='282230'>and how we applied Newton's second law.</span>
