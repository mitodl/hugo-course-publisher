  <p><span m='3790'>Let's apply the work energy theorem principle</span> <span
  m='6770'>to the motion of a block sliding down an inclined plane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='13820'>And here is an inclined plane at an angle,
  theta.</span> </p><p><span m='16415'>And lets choose a coordinate
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='17915'>We'll choose x equals 0 up here, or
  i-hat here.</span> </p><p><span m='22520'>And here is our coordinate
  function.</span> </p><p><span m='26270'>And suppose that the object starts at
  xi,</span> <span m='30745'>that it ends at x final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='35120'>If we want to calculate the work energy then</span> <span
  m='40730'>what we're going to learn is that this theorem</span> <span
  m='43550'>is two different sides.</span> </p><p><span m='45710'>Calculating
  the change in kinetic energy</span> <span m='47870'>is simply a
  description.</span> </p><p><span m='49520'>This is 1/2 M v final squared minus
  1/2 v initial squared.</span> </p><p><span m='55700'>That's a property,
  parameters of the system,</span> <span m='58970'>at the initial state, the
  speed, or the velocity's speed,</span> <span m='63410'>which is speed
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='66870'>And the same property v final in the
  final state.</span> </p><p><span m='72080'>Now over here we have two types of
  forces</span> <span m='75650'>acting on this object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='76670'>So here we need a free-body force diagram first.</span> </p><p><span
  m='84170'>And this side is where the physics [INAUDIBLE] lie.</span>
  </p><p><span m='90080'>And so we want to draw our force diagram.</span>
  </p><p><span m='92850'>So if we have our block, we have the friction
  force,</span> <span m='97160'>we have the normal force, we have mg.</span>
  </p><p><span m='100220'>Recall, if the plane is inclined theta</span> <span
  m='104450'>that's also the angle theta.</span> </p><p><span m='106610'>If we
  chose i-hat, j-hat unit vectors,</span> <span m='109160'>I just want to repeat
  that on my free-body diagram.</span> </p><p><span m='113160'>Now we can think
  of this integral as just</span> <span m='117440'>one-dimensional motion in the
  x direction.</span> </p><p><span m='120660'>And so we have two different
  forces</span> <span m='123680'>that we have to calculate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='125060'>The friction force is in the minus x direction</span> <span
  m='127760'>so we're integrating minus the friction force with respect</span>
  <span m='131180'>to displacement from x initial to x final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='135290'>And what about the gravitational force?</span>
  </p><p><span m='137940'>Well the gravitational force has a component, mg
  sine</span> <span m='141470'>theta in the x direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='144270'>So when we integrate that x component</span> <span m='146870'>we
  have now plus because it's in the same direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150750'>Remember, we're displacing a little bit dx down the inclined</span>
  <span m='154280'>plane so we're going from x initial x final of mg sine</span>
  <span m='159930'>theta, which is a constant, dx.</span> </p><p><span
  m='164090'>And so when you're applying the work energy theorem</span> <span
  m='166700'>you need to integrate your forces</span> <span m='169250'>and
  actually calculate the work.</span> </p><p><span m='171740'>Now again, if you
  looked in the j-hat direction,</span> <span m='175829'>and we applied Newton's
  second law, n minus mg cosine theta 0,</span> <span m='180770'>and our rule
  for friction is its mu k times</span> <span m='183980'>n or mu k mg cosine
  theta, then what</span> <span m='188660'>we have is in both instances we have
  a constant force.</span> </p><p><span m='192200'>So it's just force times
  displacement.</span> </p><p><span m='194240'>So we have minus mu k mg cosine
  theta times the displacement,</span> <span m='200520'>which is x initial x
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='202910'>Over here we have mg sine theta times x
  final minus x initial.</span> </p><p><span m='210800'>And now we've calculated
  separately both sides</span> <span m='214220'>of our work kinetic energy
  principle.</span> </p><p><span m='217310'>As in all our physical laws the
  equal sign</span> <span m='219500'>means the work is equal to the change in
  kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='222800'>I'll emphasize that by now
  placing the equal sign because</span> <span m='227090'>of our physical
  law.</span> </p><p><span m='228530'>And so equaling 1/2 M v final squared
  minus v initial mean</span> <span m='234350'>squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='235220'>And now I have a relationship between the parameters</span> <span
  m='238760'>of the initial state, which I'm calling x initial and v</span>
  <span m='242360'>initial, and the parameters that describe the final state,
  x</span> <span m='246280'>final, v final.</span> </p><p><span m='247690'>And
  depending on which set of these parameters are given</span> <span m='250370'>I
  can conceivably solve for the other ones.</span> </p><p><span m='253550'>One
  thing I do want to point out when</span> <span m='255200'>we do this example
  is we've described work</span> <span m='258950'>as a dot product from A to B.
  Take the friction force.</span> </p><p><span m='264740'>Well in this instance,
  if we wrote this out explicitly</span> <span m='267860'>it would be minus fk
  i-hat dot dx i-hat from the initial</span> <span m='274130'>to the
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='275390'>i-had dot i-hat is 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='277760'>And so you see, we recover from x initial to x final
  of fk dx.</span> </p><p><span m='284180'>And that was the first piece.</span>
  </p><p><span m='286950'>The second piece, the gravitational force,</span>
  <span m='289909'>dotted into ds from x initial to x final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='293510'>Well, if you wrote down the gravitational force, mg,</span> <span
  m='298610'>as a i-hat component and a negative mg cosine</span> <span
  m='304910'>theta j-hat component, then when we take the dot product
  again</span> <span m='311510'>where our ds-- here, we'll write ds as dx
  i-hat--</span> <span m='319160'>then when you dot product mg dot ds, mg dot
  ds,</span> <span m='324500'>we have i-hat dot i-hat, which is one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='327230'>But j-hat dot i-hat, they're perpendicular so that's
  0,</span> <span m='330890'>so the only piece that survives in the scalar
  product mg</span> <span m='334565'>dot ds is these two pieces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='337860'>And so we get the integral from x initial to x</span>
  <span m='340250'>final of mg sine theta times dx.</span> </p><p><span
  m='345320'>And that's precisely our second piece here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='349440'>So here's the simple application of the work energy theorem.</span>
  </p><p></p>
