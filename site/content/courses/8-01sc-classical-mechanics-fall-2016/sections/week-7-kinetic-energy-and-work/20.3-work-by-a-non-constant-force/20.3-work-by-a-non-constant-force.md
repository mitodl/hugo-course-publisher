title: 20.3 Work by a Non-Constant Force
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3510'>We already defined work in one dimension</span> <span
  m='5460'>is the product of force times displacement</span> <span m='7290'>for
  a constant force, but now let's look at a case</span> <span m='10320'>where
  we're applying a force, f, that is a function of x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='15900'>So, our component, f of x, is a function</span> <span m='20010'>of x
  in the i hat direction.</span> </p><p><span m='22390'>And one of the simplest
  examples of a force like this</span> <span m='26280'>is what we call the
  spring force.</span> </p><p><span m='30300'>Now, when we apply this force to
  our object--</span> <span m='35440'>and let's look at an object, i, i hat
  direction,</span> <span m='38720'>we'll have an origin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='40420'>And this is our plus-x coordinate system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='43350'>When we apply force-- what we want to look at</span> <span
  m='46740'>is because the force is a function of position-- then</span> <span
  m='52260'>we want to look at the displacement</span> <span m='54120'>over a
  small amount.</span> </p><p><span m='55350'>So let's call this the point
  xj.</span> </p><p><span m='59340'>And out here, let's refer to this as xj plus
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='64090'>And what we've done is we're going</span>
  <span m='66510'>to ask how much work is done when the force is
  displaced</span> <span m='71280'>from here to there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='74320'>And that's what we'll call delta x.</span> </p><p><span m='76260'>So
  now our displacement is a small displacement x of j</span> <span
  m='79950'>plus 1 minus x of j.</span> </p><p><span m='83100'>And our work for
  this small displacement-- and that's</span> <span m='86550'>why we'll indicate
  it with a delta-- is</span> <span m='88710'>equal to the force, which is a
  function of x,</span> <span m='93420'>times this displacement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='95700'>And so we get f of x times x of j plus 1 minus x of
  j.</span> </p><p><span m='101700'>And what we have to indicate here</span>
  <span m='104130'>is because the force is varying, we're</span> <span
  m='106050'>looking at just this displacement here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='108539'>Let's refer to this force as in the j-th part.</span> </p><p><span
  m='117090'>The total work is just the sum of all these scalar
  quantities.</span> </p><p><span m='121050'>Remember, although force is a
  vector and displacement</span> <span m='124260'>is a vector, the product of
  these two quantities</span> <span m='127410'>is a scalar.</span> </p><p><span
  m='129000'>And so, if we want the total work,</span> <span m='131760'>we have
  to sum from j goes from 1 to n of this quantity</span> <span m='137970'>f of j
  dot-- and I'll put a little j there</span> <span m='140370'>to indicate that--
  delta xj.</span> </p><p><span m='143130'>What does this sum mean?</span>
  </p><p><span m='144880'>Well imagine that we're making a series of
  displacements</span> <span m='150090'>all the way out to a final
  position,</span> <span m='152820'>x final, and we divided this interval into n
  pieces.</span> </p><p><span m='157470'>And so this represents the little
  bit</span> <span m='159540'>of work done for all of these
  displacements.</span> </p><p><span m='162600'>And that is what we define to be
  the work</span> <span m='165270'>for a non-constant force.</span> </p><p><span
  m='171780'>The issue here is about how fine we cut this interval in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='178380'>We made n individual pieces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='182070'>But if we want to ask ourselves, what</span> <span m='184560'>is
  the limit as n goes to infinity,</span> <span m='187860'>then that's what we
  now need to consider.</span> </p><p><span m='191310'>So what we're doing is
  we're making</span> <span m='192900'>smaller and smaller and smaller little
  displacements.</span> </p><p><span m='196170'>And we're taking this sum-- j
  goes from 1 to n</span> <span m='199660'>of x of xj times delta xj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='203490'>And this limit of a sum is by definition</span> <span
  m='207690'>the integral of the force with respect to dx.</span> </p><p><span
  m='211240'>So what we end up with is our work is the integral of f of
  x.</span> </p><p><span m='217560'>It's a function and I'm going to have an
  integration variable, x</span> <span m='220590'>prime of dx prime, where x
  prime is</span> <span m='225990'>going from our initial position to our final
  position.</span> </p><p><span m='231360'>And this is now our definition of
  work</span> <span m='234870'>which generalizes a constant force to a
  non-constant force.</span> </p><p><span m='239640'>Again, let's try to look at
  some type</span> <span m='242190'>of geometric interpretation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='245790'>So if we plotted f of x versus x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='250070'>And now let's consider a case where</span> <span m='254280'>we have
  some arbitrary force.</span> </p><p><span m='256920'>So I'm going to just draw
  the force as if it were arbitrarily</span> <span m='261570'>increasing as a
  function of x.</span> </p><p><span m='264630'>And here is our x
  initial.</span> </p><p><span m='267270'>And here's our x final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='270660'>And again, we would like to make a geometric
  interpretation.</span> </p><p><span m='274720'>Let's consider xj.</span>
  </p><p><span m='277730'>And I'll make this very big.</span> </p><p><span
  m='279150'>xj plus 1 for the sake of visualization.</span> </p><p><span
  m='283980'>And this value here is f of xj.</span> </p><p><span m='291030'>And
  so what we see now is that little bit of work,</span> <span m='294030'>like we
  had for a constant force,</span> <span m='296250'>can be approximated as the
  area underneath the curve for just</span> <span m='301440'>this small interval
  between xj and xj plus 1.</span> </p><p><span m='305740'>And if we make this
  sum, what we're doing</span> <span m='308730'>is we're just taking a series of
  approximations</span> <span m='313680'>to the area under these curves.</span>
  </p><p><span m='317880'>Now you can see, graphically, that there</span> <span
  m='320880'>is very little error when the function was nearly constant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='324930'>But in this position, where the function is
  growing,</span> <span m='328320'>this represents our little error.</span>
  </p><p><span m='332070'>However, in the limit, as n goes to infinity,</span>
  <span m='335100'>we can make that error go vanishingly small.</span>
  </p><p><span m='339130'>So once again, we see, as a geometric
  interpretation,</span> <span m='344250'>that this is the area under the curve
  of the force</span> <span m='349000'>versus position between the points</span>
  <span m='351790'>initial xi and initial-- and the final, x</span> <span
  m='356550'>final, where the particle is being</span> <span
  m='359820'>displaced from an initial position</span> <span m='363030'>to some
  final position.</span> </p><p><span m='364380'>And here we can call our
  initial position anywhere we want.</span> </p><p><span m='368490'>If I write
  that, this x initial, to the final position.</span> </p><p><span
  m='372360'>And that's our generalization of the definition of work.</span>
