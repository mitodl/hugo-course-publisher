transcript: >-
  <p><span m='1310'>We previously discussed the concept</span> <span m='3290'>of
  conservation of momentum.</span> </p><p><span m='5600'>We will soon see that
  there is another very powerful</span> <span m='8119'>conservation principle in
  physics called</span> <span m='10490'>the conservation of energy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='12500'>It states that there is a certain quantity called
  energy</span> <span m='14930'>that remains unchanged in the system</span>
  <span m='17600'>except for any that flows in or out of the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='21020'>It's hard to say exactly what energy is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='24180'>It's an abstract quantity that we count up in a certain
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='27950'>When calculating the energy of a
  system,</span> <span m='29750'>we must keep careful track of any energy
  that</span> <span m='32540'>enters or leaves the system.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34820'>There are also a number of different forms</span> <span m='36620'>of
  energy-- kinetic energy, gravitational energy,</span> <span m='40370'>elastic
  energy, electrical energy, heat energy,</span> <span m='44180'>and
  others.</span> </p><p><span m='45570'>Each of these has its own formula for
  calculation.</span> </p><p><span m='48830'>If you sum all these energies up
  for a system,</span> <span m='51830'>the total will remain unchanged except
  for what</span> <span m='54380'>goes in and comes out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='56930'>It turns out that using energy rather than force,</span> <span
  m='59510'>one can construct a complete system of mechanics</span> <span
  m='62390'>that is fully equivalent to the Newtonian system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='65420'>This was done by Lagrange and Hamilton.</span>
  </p><p><span m='67970'>And you may encounter their system in the
  future,</span> <span m='70950'>if you take more advanced courses in
  physics.</span> </p><p><span m='74430'>However, even in the Newtonian
  system,</span> <span m='76340'>energy remains a useful concept.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78470'>This week, we will discuss kinetic energy,</span> <span
  m='81020'>the energy associated with the motion of a mass,</span> <span
  m='83900'>and also the concept of work, which</span> <span m='85880'>allows us
  to calculate how the action of a force</span> <span m='88640'>changes the
  kinetic energy.</span> </p><p><span m='90770'>We will see that the work done
  by a force</span> <span m='92990'>is calculated by evaluating an integral
  that</span> <span m='95930'>in general depends upon the specific trajectory or
  path</span> <span m='100130'>taken by the object or system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='102330'>However, we will also see that there [? is ?]</span>
  <span m='104300'>a special class of forces called conservative forces for
  which</span> <span m='107960'>the work integral is path independent</span>
  <span m='109820'>and instead depends only on the starting and ending
  points.</span> </p><p><span m='114030'>Finally, we will discuss
  examples</span> <span m='115700'>of both conservative and non-conservative
  forces.</span> </p><p></p>
