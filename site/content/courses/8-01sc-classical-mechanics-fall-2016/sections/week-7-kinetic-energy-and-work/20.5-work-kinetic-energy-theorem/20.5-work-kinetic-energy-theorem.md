transcript: >-
  <p><span m='3580'>We are now going to derive the work-energy principle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6580'>We're going to do so by using Newton's second
  law,</span> <span m='9880'>but we're not going to consider it with respect to
  time</span> <span m='13180'>as what we've previously done, but we're
  now</span> <span m='15100'>going to consider it with respect to space.</span>
  </p><p><span m='18070'>So F equals ma, and we're going to take</span> <span
  m='21730'>the x component of that.</span> </p><p><span m='24130'>And now,
  we're going to integrate this.</span> </p><p><span m='26560'>So Fx dx prime,
  and it runs from x prime equals</span> <span m='32380'>x initial to some final
  value.</span> </p><p><span m='37420'>And then over here, we're going to pull
  the m out. m integral,</span> <span m='43030'>and it also goes from some
  initial to some final value.</span> </p><p><span m='49390'>And we're going to
  have ax dx.</span> </p><p><span m='53860'>We have previously shown that this
  integral here</span> <span m='58570'>is one-half v final squared minus v
  initial squared.</span> </p><p><span m='65590'>And if we're going to plug this
  in here,</span> <span m='67930'>we're going to get that this expression
  is</span> <span m='71910'>one-half mv final squared minus v initial
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='78610'>And you should recognize this
  term.</span> </p><p><span m='80710'>This is the change in kinetic
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='86060'>And what we have here, on the other
  side,</span> <span m='89620'>this integral fx dx is defined to be</span> <span
  m='95200'>the work-- work done on the system, which</span> <span
  m='99789'>we're going to call w.</span> </p><p><span m='102400'>And that work
  done on the system,</span> <span m='105390'>it's change in kinetic
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='108110'>So this is the work-energy
  principle.</span> </p><p></p>
