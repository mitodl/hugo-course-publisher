course_description: >-
  <p>This course was offered as a non-credit program during the <a
  href="http://web.mit.edu/iap/about/index.html">Independent Activities Period
  (IAP)</a>, January 2008. A more recent version is available as course <a
  href="./resolveuid/df24ba19002e5b0339ab8ace6e254ffd"><em>18.S997 Introduction
  To MATLAB Programming</em></a>, including video lectures.</p> <p>The course,
  intended for students with no programming experience, provides the foundations
  of programming in MATLAB&reg;. Variables, arrays, conditional statements,
  loops, functions, and plots are explained. At the end of the course, students
  should be able to use MATLAB in their own work, and be prepared to deepen
  their MATLAB programming skills and tackle other languages for computing, such
  as Java, C++, or Python.</p> <p>The course mostly follows the official <a
  href="http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/pdf_doc/matlab/getstart.pdf">MATLAB
  Manual</a>, available from <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">The
  MathWorks</a>. We will cover material from chapters 2-5.</p>
