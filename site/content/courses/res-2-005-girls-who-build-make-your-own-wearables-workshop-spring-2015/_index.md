  <p>The Girls Who Build: Make Your Own Wearables workshop for high school girls
  is an introduction to computer science, electrical and mechanical engineering
  through wearable technology. The workshop, developed by MIT Lincoln
  Laboratory, consists of two major hands-on projects in manufacturing and
  wearable electronics. These include 3D printing jewelry and laser cutting a
  purse, as well as programming LEDs to light up when walking. Participants
  learn the design process, 3D computer modeling, and machine shop tools, in
  addition to writing code and building a circuit.</p>
