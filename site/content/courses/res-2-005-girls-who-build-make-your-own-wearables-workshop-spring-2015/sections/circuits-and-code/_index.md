Overview
--------

Students learn the components of a basic circuit and the fundamentals of electricity. Some key concepts include pinouts and how circuits are connected through soldering. Then, the students build their own LED, Arduino, and pressure sensor circuit. Following the construction of their wearable circuit, the students test each component.
