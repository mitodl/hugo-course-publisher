Overview
--------

Students are introduced to computer programming by writing Arduino code for a wearable circuit. Firstly, students are introduced to the basic concepts in programming like variables, loops, and logic. Students exercise these concepts through an interactive activity of building a peanut butter & jelly sandwich. Then, students program components of their wearable circuit leading up to the final code: LEDs light up while walking.
