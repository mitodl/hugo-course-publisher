Description
-----------

### What is the Make Your Own Wearables program?

The Lincoln Laboratory _Make Your Own Wearables_ program is an introduction to engineering through wearable technology. The full day workshop developed and hosted by [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](https://www.ll.mit.edu/) consists of two major hands-on projects in manufacturing and wearable electronics.

Its mission is to introduce high-school girls to what engineering is, how it is used in many different applications, and to gain key engineering skills such as computer programming and computer aided design (CAD). This workshop aims to help girls entering college have a clear depiction of what an engineer does and have the hands-on skills required to be successful in this field.

### What will participants do?

High-school girls will spend the day learning the design process, 3D computer modeling, how to write code, and how to build a circuit. Participants tour a rapid prototyping machine shop and see how 3D printed jewelry and laser-cut purses are created. They will design a bracelet using [SolidWorks®](https://www.solidworks.com/sw/education/student-software-3d-mcad.htm) and code a [FLORA](https://www.adafruit.com/products/659) in Arduino for a wearable circuit with pressure sensor and LEDs.
