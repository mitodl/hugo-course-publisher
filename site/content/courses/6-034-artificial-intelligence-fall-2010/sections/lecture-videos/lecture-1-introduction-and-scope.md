  <p><span m='18200'>PATRICK WINSTON: Welcome to 6034.</span> </p><p><span
  m='26190'>I don't know if I can deal with this microphone.</span> </p><p><span
  m='28230'>We'll see what happens.</span> </p><p><span m='29405'>It's going to
  be a good year.</span> </p><p><span m='30380'>We've got [INAUDIBLE] a bunch of
  interesting people.</span> </p><p><span m='33530'>It's always interesting to
  see what people named their</span> <span m='35790'>children two decades
  ago.</span> </p><p><span m='39820'>And I find they were overwhelmed with
  Emilys.</span> </p><p><span m='42510'>And there are not too many Peters,
  Pauls, and Marys, but</span> <span m='45420'>enough to call forth a suitable
  song at some point.</span> </p><p><span m='50540'>We have lots of Jesses of
  both genders.</span> </p><p><span m='55630'>We have a [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span
  m='57220'>of both genders.</span> </p><p><span m='59890'>And we have a Duncan,
  where's Duncan?</span> </p><p><span m='62810'>There you are, Duncan.</span>
  </p><p><span m='64080'>You've changed your hairstyle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='66900'>I want to assure use that the Thane of Cawdor is not taking</span>
  <span m='70130'>the course this semester.</span> </p><p><span m='72390'>What
  I'm going to do is tell you about artificial</span> <span
  m='74890'>intelligence today, and what this subject is about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='78680'>There's been about a 10% percent turnover in the
  roster</span> <span m='84100'>in the last 24 hours.</span> </p><p><span
  m='85320'>I expect another 10% turnover in the next 24 hours, too.</span>
  </p><p><span m='89680'>So I know many of you are sightseers, wanting to know
  if</span> <span m='92600'>this is something you want to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='93720'>So I'm going to tell you about what we're going to do
  this</span> <span m='96140'>semester, and what you'll know when you get out of
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='100229'>I'm going to walk you through this
  outline.</span> </p><p><span m='103620'>I'm going to start by talking about
  what artificial</span> <span m='105539'>intelligence is, and why we do
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='108630'>And then I'll give you a little bit of the
  history of</span> <span m='110160'>artificial intelligence, and conclude with
  some of the</span> <span m='114000'>covenants by which we run the
  course.</span> </p><p><span m='116570'>One of which is no laptops,
  please.</span> </p><p><span m='120900'>I'll explain why we have these
  covenants at the end.</span> </p><p><span m='125620'>So what is it?</span>
  </p><p><span m='127360'>Well, it must have something to do with
  thinking.</span> </p><p><span m='132220'>So let's start up here, a definition
  of artificial</span> <span m='135280'>intelligence, by saying that it's about
  thinking,</span> <span m='141820'>whatever that is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='143850'>My definition of artificial intelligence has</span> <span
  m='146100'>to be rather broad.</span> </p><p><span m='148560'>So we're going
  to say it's not only about thinking.</span> </p><p><span m='151710'>It's also
  about perception, and it's about action.</span> </p><p><span m='162610'>And if
  this were a philosophy class, then I'd stop right</span> <span
  m='166060'>there and just say, in this subject we're going to talk</span>
  <span m='169120'>about problems involving thinking,</span> <span
  m='172370'>perception, and action.</span> </p><p><span m='174860'>But this is
  not a philosophy class.</span> </p><p><span m='177890'>This a Course six
  class.</span> </p><p><span m='179050'>It's an engineering school class.</span>
  </p><p><span m='180350'>It's an MIT class.</span> </p><p><span m='182000'>So
  we need more than that.</span> </p><p><span m='183940'>And therefore we're
  going to talk about models that are</span> <span m='192380'>targeted at
  thinking, perception, and action.</span> </p><p><span m='200329'>And this
  should not be strange to you, because model making</span> <span m='203800'>is
  what MIT is about.</span> </p><p><span m='206900'>You run into someone at a
  bar, or relative asks you what you</span> <span m='209540'>do at MIT, the
  right knee jerk reaction is to say, we learned</span> <span m='213200'>how to
  build models.</span> </p><p><span m='215130'>That's what we do at MIT.</span>
  </p><p><span m='216990'>We build the models using differential
  equations.</span> </p><p><span m='220570'>We build models using
  probabilities.</span> </p><p><span m='223450'>We build models using physical
  and computational simulations.</span> </p><p><span m='227829'>Whatever we do,
  we build models.</span> </p><p><span m='230300'>Even in humanities class, MIT
  approach is to make models</span> <span m='235710'>that we can use to explain
  the past, predict the future,</span> <span m='240290'>understand the subject,
  and control the world.</span> </p><p><span m='243050'>That's what MIT is
  about.</span> </p><p><span m='244290'>And that's what this subject is about,
  too.</span> </p><p><span m='246400'>And now, our models are models of
  thinking.</span> </p><p><span m='250650'>So you might say, if I take
  this</span> <span m='252060'>classic will I get smarter?</span> </p><p><span
  m='253840'>And the answer is yes.</span> </p><p><span m='254760'>You will get
  smarter.</span> </p><p><span m='255500'>Because you'll have better models of
  your own thinking,</span> <span m='257980'>not just the subject matter of the
  subject, but better models</span> <span m='261120'>of your own
  thinking.</span> </p><p><span m='263840'>So models targeted at
  thinking,</span> <span m='265370'>perception, and action.</span> </p><p><span
  m='267670'>We know that's not quite enough, because in order to</span> <span
  m='269460'>have a model, you have to have representation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='273790'>So let's say that artificial intelligence is about</span> <span
  m='277040'>representations that support the making of models to</span> <span
  m='292470'>facilitate an understanding of thinking,</span> <span
  m='295040'>perception, and action.</span> </p><p><span m='297500'>Now you
  might say to me, well what's a representation?</span> </p><p><span
  m='299409'>And what good can it do?</span> </p><p><span m='300170'>So I'd like
  to take a brief moment to tell you about</span> <span
  m='302780'>gyroscopes.</span> </p><p><span m='303540'>Many of you have friends
  in mechanical engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='306380'>One of the best ways
  embarrass them is to say here's a</span> <span m='310980'>bicycle
  wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='312210'>And if I spin it, and blow hard on it
  right here, on the</span> <span m='316720'>edge of the wheel, is going to turn
  over</span> <span m='319110'>this way or this way?</span> </p><p><span
  m='323160'>I guarantee that what they will do is they'll put their</span>
  <span m='326250'>hand in an arthritic posture called the right hand
  screw</span> <span m='329400'>rule, aptly named because people who use it tend
  to get</span> <span m='335870'>the right answer about 50% of the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='341460'>But we're never going to make that mistake
  again.</span> </p><p><span m='344560'>Because we're electrical
  engineers,</span> <span m='345780'>not mechanical engineers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='346820'>And we know about representation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='349300'>What we're going to do is we're going to think about it</span>
  <span m='351290'>a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='352486'>And we're going
  to use some duct tape to help us think</span> <span m='354780'>about just one
  piece of the wheel.</span> </p><p><span m='357730'>So I want you to just think
  about that piece of the wheel</span> <span m='361270'>as the wheel comes
  flying over the top, and I</span> <span m='363050'>blow on it like
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='364810'>What's going to happen to that one
  piece?</span> </p><p><span m='368090'>It's going to go off that way,
  right?</span> </p><p><span m='370520'>And the next piece is going to go off
  that way too.</span> </p><p><span m='373400'>So when it comes over, it has to
  go that way.</span> </p><p><span m='377610'>Let me do some ground f here just
  to be sure.</span> </p><p><span m='382200'>It's very powerful feeling.</span>
  </p><p><span m='386760'>Try it.</span> </p><p><span m='388730'>We need a
  demonstration.</span> </p><p><span m='389540'>I don't anybody think that I'm
  cheating, here.</span> </p><p><span m='393010'>So let's just twist it one way
  or the other.</span> </p><p><span m='399840'>So that's powerful pull, isn't
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='402100'>Alex is now never going to get the
  gyroscope wrong, because</span> <span m='406820'>he's got the right
  representation.</span> </p><p><span m='409870'>So much of what you're going to
  accumulate in this subject</span> <span m='412130'>is a suite of
  representations that will help you to build</span> <span m='414560'>programs
  that are intelligent.</span> </p><p><span m='416990'>But I want to give you a
  second example, one a little</span> <span m='420330'>bit more
  computational.</span> </p><p><span m='421300'>But one of which was very
  familiar to you by the time</span> <span m='423990'>you went to first grade,
  in most cases.</span> </p><p><span m='426690'>It's the problem of the farmer,
  the fox, the goose,</span> <span m='429610'>and the grain.</span> </p><p><span
  m='431020'>There's a river, a leaky rowboat that can only carry</span> <span
  m='434070'>the farmer, and one of his four possessions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='437340'>So what's the right</span> <span m='438080'>representation for this
  problem?</span> </p><p><span m='441220'>It might be a picture of the
  farmer.</span> </p><p><span m='444370'>It might be a poem about the situation,
  perhaps a haiku.</span> </p><p><span m='449570'>We know that those are not the
  right representation.</span> </p><p><span m='453240'>Somehow, we get the sense
  that the right representation most</span> <span m='458340'>involve something
  about the location of the participants</span> <span m='462440'>in this
  scenario.</span> </p><p><span m='464270'>So we might draw a picture that looks
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='468480'>There's the scenario, and here in
  glorious green,</span> <span m='474150'>representing our algae infested rivers
  is the river.</span> </p><p><span m='478450'>And here's the farmer, the fox,
  the goose, and the grain.</span> </p><p><span m='485306'>An initial
  situation.</span> </p><p><span m='487900'>Now there are other situations like
  this one, for example.</span> </p><p><span m='493360'>We have the river, and
  the farmer, and the</span> <span m='499200'>goose is on that side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='501590'>And the fox and the grain is on that side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='506160'>And we know that the farmer can execute a movement
  from</span> <span m='511520'>one situation to another.</span> </p><p><span
  m='514929'>So now we're getting somewhere where with the problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='516980'>This is at MIT approach to the farmer, fox,</span>
  <span m='519120'>goose, and grain problem.</span> </p><p><span m='520010'>It
  might have stumped you when you were a little kid.</span> </p><p><span
  m='525370'>How many such situations are there?</span> </p><p><span
  m='530180'>What do you think, Tanya?</span> </p><p><span m='532632'>It looks
  to me like all four of individuals can be on one</span> <span m='536280'>side
  or the other.</span> </p><p><span m='538740'>So for every position the farmer
  can be, each of the</span> <span m='541480'>other things can be on either side
  of the river.</span> </p><p><span m='546060'>So it would be two to the fourth
  she says aggressively</span> <span m='549500'>and without hesitation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='552060'>Yes, two to the fourth, 16 possibilities.</span>
  </p><p><span m='554020'>So we could actually draw out the entire graph.</span>
  </p><p><span m='557590'>It's small enough.</span> </p><p><span
  m='559770'>There's another position over here with the farmer, fox,</span>
  <span m='564620'>goose, and grain.</span> </p><p><span m='565832'>And in fact
  that's the one we want.</span> </p><p><span m='568560'>And if we draw out the
  entire graph, it looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='575910'>This is a
  graph of the situations and the allowed</span> <span m='580250'>connections
  between them.</span> </p><p><span m='582960'>Why are there not 16?</span>
  </p><p><span m='587280'>Because the other--</span> <span m='588420'>how many
  have I got?</span> </p><p><span m='589170'>Four?</span> </p><p><span
  m='589625'>10?</span> </p><p><span m='591720'>The others are situations in
  which somebody gets eaten.</span> </p><p><span m='595600'>So we don't want to
  go to any of those places.</span> </p><p><span m='598490'>So having got the
  representation, something</span> <span m='600850'>magical has happened.</span>
  </p><p><span m='602750'>We've got our constraints exposed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='618420'>And that's why we build representations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='619860'>That's whey you algebra in high school, because algebraic</span>
  <span m='623080'>notation exposes the constraints that make it</span> <span
  m='625410'>possible to actually figure out how many customers you get</span>
  <span m='629630'>for the number of advertisements you place in</span> <span
  m='631510'>the newspaper.</span> </p><p><span m='634420'>So artificial
  intelligence is about constraints exposed by</span> <span
  m='636870'>representations that support models targeted to thinking--</span>
  <span m='639760'>actually there's one more thing, too.</span> </p><p><span
  m='641450'>Not quite done.</span> </p><p><span m='642800'>Because after all,
  in the end, we have to build programs.</span> </p><p><span m='648500'>So it's
  about algorithms enabled by constraints exposed</span> <span m='664820'>by
  representations that model targeted thinking, perception,</span> <span
  m='669510'>and action.</span> </p><p><span m='671000'>So these algorithms, or
  we might call them just as well</span> <span m='675520'>procedures, or we
  might call them just as well methods,</span> <span m='678620'>whatever you
  like.</span> </p><p><span m='680030'>These are the stuff of what artificial
  intelligence is</span> <span m='681980'>about-- methods, algorithms,
  representations.</span> </p><p><span m='684860'>I'd like to give you one more
  example.</span> </p><p><span m='687470'>It's something we call, in artificial
  intelligence,</span> <span m='689570'>generated test.</span> </p><p><span
  m='691770'>And it's such a simple idea, you'll never hear it again in</span>
  <span m='693640'>this subject.</span> </p><p><span m='694840'>But it's an idea
  you need to add to your repertoire of</span> <span m='697130'>problem solving
  methods, techniques, procedures, and</span> <span
  m='700780'>algorithms.</span> </p><p><span m='702900'>So here's how it
  works.</span> </p><p><span m='708380'>Maybe I can explain to best by starting
  off with an example.</span> </p><p><span m='712370'>Here's a tree leaf I
  picked off a tree on</span> <span m='715590'>the way over to class.</span>
  </p><p><span m='716760'>I hope it's not the last of the species.</span>
  </p><p><span m='719950'>What is it, what kind of tree?</span> </p><p><span
  m='725680'>I don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='726720'>I never did learn my
  trees, or my colors, or my</span> <span m='729870'>multiplication
  tables.</span> </p><p><span m='731910'>So I have to go back to this book, the
  Audubon Society</span> <span m='737060'>Field Guide to North American
  Trees.</span> </p><p><span m='738870'>And how would I solve the
  problem?</span> </p><p><span m='741160'>It's pretty simple.</span>
  </p><p><span m='741790'>I just turn the pages one at a time, until I find
  something</span> <span m='746490'>that looks like this leaf.</span>
  </p><p><span m='748700'>And then I discover it's a sycamore, or
  something.</span> </p><p><span m='753190'>MIT's full of them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='755930'>So when I do that, I do something very intuitive,
  very</span> <span m='759660'>natural, something you do all the time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='761070'>But we're going to give it a name.</span> </p><p><span
  m='762550'>We're going to call it generate and test.</span> </p><p><span
  m='775510'>And generate and test method consists of generating some</span>
  <span m='779790'>possible solutions, feeding them into a box that tests</span>
  <span m='784260'>them, and then out the other side comes mostly
  failures.</span> </p><p><span m='790760'>But every once in a while we get
  something that succeeds</span> <span m='794890'>and pleases us.</span>
  </p><p><span m='797240'>That's what I did with the leaf.</span> </p><p><span
  m='798960'>But now you have a name for it.</span> </p><p><span m='801340'>Once
  you have a name for something, you</span> <span m='805490'>get power over
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='806860'>You can start to talk about it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='808970'>So I can say, if you're doing a generate and test
  approach</span> <span m='812180'>to a problem, you better build a generator
  with certain</span> <span m='817280'>properties that make generators
  good.</span> </p><p><span m='820210'>For example, they should not be
  redundant.</span> </p><p><span m='822940'>They shouldn't give you the same
  solution twice.</span> </p><p><span m='826210'>They should be
  informable.</span> </p><p><span m='829680'>They should be able to absorb
  information such as, this is a</span> <span m='832620'>deciduous tree.</span>
  </p><p><span m='833650'>Don't bother looking at the conifers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='836260'>So once you have a name for something, you can
  start</span> <span m='838130'>talking about.</span> </p><p><span
  m='839370'>And that vocabulary gives you power.</span> </p><p><span
  m='842580'>So we call this the Rumpelstiltskin Principle</span> <span
  m='846610'>perhaps The first of our powerful ideas for the day.</span>
  </p><p><span m='850530'>This subject is full of powerful ideas.</span>
  </p><p><span m='852180'>There will be some in every class.</span> </p><p><span
  m='854300'>Rumpelstiltskin Principle says that once you can name</span> <span
  m='856480'>something, you get power over it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='858250'>You know what that little thing is on</span> <span m='859220'>the
  end of your shoelace?</span> </p><p><span m='863650'>It's interesting.</span>
  </p><p><span m='864280'>She's gesturing like mad.</span> </p><p><span
  m='866480'>That's something we'll talk about later, too--</span> <span
  m='868920'>motor stuff, and how it helps us think.</span> </p><p><span
  m='872070'>What is it?</span> </p><p><span m='873310'>No one knows?</span>
  </p><p><span m='875500'>It's an ag something, right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='876780'>It's an aglet, very good.</span> </p><p><span m='878910'>So once
  you have the name, you can start to talk about.</span> </p><p><span
  m='881460'>You can say the purpose of an aglet is pretty much like the</span>
  <span m='884320'>whipping on the end of a rope.</span> </p><p><span
  m='885590'>It keeps the thing from unwinding.</span> </p><p><span
  m='888140'>Now you have a place to hang that knowledge.</span> </p><p><span
  m='891140'>So we're talking about this frequently from now into the</span>
  <span m='894730'>rest of the semester, the power of being</span> <span
  m='896680'>able to name things.</span> </p><p><span m='898010'>Symbolic labels
  give us power over concepts.</span> </p><p><span m='901850'>While we're here I
  should also say that this is a very simple</span> <span m='904290'>idea,
  generate and test.</span> </p><p><span m='906570'>And you might be tempted to
  say to someone, we learned</span> <span m='909770'>about generate and test
  today.</span> </p><p><span m='911470'>But it's a trivial idea.</span>
  </p><p><span m='914290'>The word trivial is a word I would like you to purge
  from</span> <span m='917030'>your vocabulary, because it's a very dangerous
  label.</span> </p><p><span m='922340'>The reason it's dangerous is because
  there's a difference</span> <span m='925970'>between trivial and
  simple.</span> </p><p><span m='927360'>What is it?</span> </p><p><span
  m='930310'>What's the difference between labeling something as trivial</span>
  <span m='933320'>and calling it simple?</span> </p><p><span
  m='934570'>Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='939440'>Exactly so.</span> </p><p><span
  m='940450'>He says that simple can be powerful, and trivial makes it</span>
  <span m='944950'>sound like it's not only simple, but of little worth.</span>
  </p><p><span m='948830'>So many MIT people miss opportunities, because
  they</span> <span m='953060'>have a tendency to think that ideas aren't
  important unless</span> <span m='955270'>they're complicated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='957660'>But the most simple ideas in artificial intelligence
  are</span> <span m='959965'>often the most powerful.</span> </p><p><span
  m='962120'>We could teach an artificial intelligence course to you</span>
  <span m='964130'>that would be so full of mathematics it would make a</span>
  <span m='966180'>Course 18 professor gag.</span> </p><p><span m='969150'>But
  those ideas would be merely gratuitously</span> <span m='971900'>complicated,
  and gratuitously mathematical, and gratuitously</span> <span m='975590'>not
  simple.</span> </p><p><span m='976940'>Simple ideas are often the most
  powerful.</span> </p><p><span m='982460'>So where are we so far?</span>
  </p><p><span m='984570'>We talked about the definition.</span> </p><p><span
  m='987165'>We talked about an example of a method.</span> </p><p><span
  m='989660'>Showed you a representation, and perhaps also talked about</span>
  <span m='992560'>the first idea, too.</span> </p><p><span m='994220'>You've
  got the representation right, you're</span> <span m='996690'>often almost
  done.</span> </p><p><span m='998440'>Because with this representation, they
  can</span> <span m='1001030'>immediately see that there are just two solutions
  to this</span> <span m='1004580'>problem, something that wouldn't have
  occurred to us</span> <span m='1008930'>when we were little kids, and didn't
  think to draw the</span> <span m='1010630'>[? state ?] diagram.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1016640'>There's still one more thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1021410'>In the past, and in other places, artificial</span> <span
  m='1024740'>intelligence is often taught as purely about reasoning.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1029108'>But we solve problems with our eyes, as well
  as</span> <span m='1032515'>our symbolic apparatus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1035420'>And you solved that problem with your eyes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1038858'>So I like to reinforce that by giving you a little puzzle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1042839'>Let's see, who's here?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1050370'>I don't see [? Kambe, ?] but I'll bet he's from Africa.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1052420'>Is anyone from Africa?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1054610'>No one's from Africa?</span> </p><p><span m='1057180'>No?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1058960'>Well so much the better--</span> <span
  m='1066090'>because they would know the answer to the puzzle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1067760'>Here's the puzzle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1069230'>How many countries in Africa does the Equator cross?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1076690'>Would anybody be willing to stake their</span> <span
  m='1078290'>life on their answer?</span> </p><p><span m='1082520'>Probably
  not.</span> </p><p><span m='1086910'>Well, now let me repeat the
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='1096550'>How many countries in Africa does
  the Equator cross?</span> </p><p><span m='1101995'>Yeah, six.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1103040'>What happened is a miracle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1105970'>The miracle is that I have communicated with you through</span>
  <span m='1109770'>language, and your language system commanded your
  visual</span> <span m='1114660'>system to execute a program that involves
  scanning across</span> <span m='1118590'>that line, counting as you go.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1121390'>And then your vision system came back to your
  language</span> <span m='1123770'>system and said, six.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1125950'>And that is a miracle.</span> </p><p><span m='1127575'>And without
  understanding that miracle, we'll never have a</span> <span m='1130600'>full
  understanding of the nature of intelligence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1133330'>But that kind of problem solving is the kind of problem</span>
  <span m='1135720'>solving I wish we could teach you a lot about it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1137950'>But we can't teach you about stuff we don't
  understand.</span> </p><p><span m='1140420'>We [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span
  m='1141500'>for that.</span> </p><p><span m='1145540'>That's a little bit
  about the definition and some examples.</span> </p><p><span m='1148930'>What's
  it for?</span> </p><p><span m='1150460'>We can deal with that very
  quickly.</span> </p><p><span m='1152530'>If we're engineers, it's for building
  smarter programs.</span> </p><p><span m='1156440'>It's about building a tool
  kit of representations and methods</span> <span m='1160690'>that make it
  possible to build smarter programs.</span> </p><p><span m='1162660'>And you
  will find, these days, that you can't build a big</span> <span
  m='1165660'>system without having embedded in it somewhere the ideas
  that</span> <span m='1168520'>we talk about in the subject.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1171230'>If you're a scientist, there's a somewhat
  different</span> <span m='1173420'>motivation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1173970'>But it amounts to studying the same sorts of things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1176420'>If you're a scientist, you're interested in what it
  is that</span> <span m='1180800'>enables us to build a computational account
  of</span> <span m='1183800'>intelligence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1185110'>That's the part that I do.</span> </p><p><span m='1186910'>But
  most this subject is going to be about the other part,</span> <span
  m='1189620'>the part that makes it possible for you to build</span> <span
  m='1192440'>smarter programs.</span> </p><p><span m='1193510'>And some of it
  will be about what it is that makes us</span> <span m='1196990'>different from
  the chimpanzees with whom we share an enormous</span> <span
  m='1202900'>fraction of our DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1205130'>It used to be
  thought that we share 95% of our DNA with</span> <span
  m='1208010'>chimpanzees.</span> </p><p><span m='1209840'>Then it went up to
  98.</span> </p><p><span m='1213660'>Thank God it stopped about there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1215470'>Then it actually went back a little bit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1216770'>I think we're back down to 94.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1223350'>How about if we talk a little bit now about the history of</span>
  <span m='1225190'>AI, so we can see how we got to where we are today?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1228940'>This will also be a history of AI that tells you a
  little bit</span> <span m='1231040'>about what you'll learn in this
  course.</span> </p><p><span m='1236610'>It all started with Lady Lovelace, the
  world's first</span> <span m='1242730'>programmer, Who wrote programs about
  100 years before there</span> <span m='1247750'>were computers to run
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='1250500'>But it's interesting that even in 1842,
  people were hassling</span> <span m='1254140'>her about whether computers
  could get really smart.</span> </p><p><span m='1257200'>And she said, "The
  analytical engine has no pretensions to</span> <span m='1263370'>originate
  anything.</span> </p><p><span m='1265500'>It can do whatever we know how to
  order it to perform."</span> <span m='1270080'>Screwball idea that persists to
  this day.</span> </p><p><span m='1273600'>Nevertheless, that was the origin of
  it all.</span> </p><p><span m='1275730'>That was the beginning of the
  discussions.</span> </p><p><span m='1277330'>And then nothing much happened
  until about 1950, when Alan</span> <span m='1282050'>Turing wrote his famous
  paper, which</span> <span m='1284110'>introduced the Turing test.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1287090'>Of course, Alan Turing had previously won the
  Second</span> <span m='1289340'>World War by breaking the German code, the
  Ultra Code,</span> <span m='1294090'>for which the British government rewarded
  him by</span> <span m='1296240'>driving him to suicide, because he happened to
  be</span> <span m='1298180'>homosexual.</span> </p><p><span m='1301040'>But
  Turing wrote his paper in 1950, and that was the first</span> <span
  m='1304260'>milestone after Lady Lovelace's comment in 1842.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1308720'>And then the modern era really began with a paper
  written by</span> <span m='1313140'>Marvin Minsky in 1960, titled "Steps
  Toward Artificial</span> <span m='1316120'>Intelligence." And it wasn't a long
  after that Jim</span> <span m='1319530'>[? Slagle, ?]</span> <span
  m='1321490'>a nearly blind graduate student, wrote a program that</span> <span
  m='1323830'>did symbolic integration.</span> </p><p><span m='1327270'>Not
  adding up area under a curve, but doing symbolic</span> <span
  m='1329850'>integration just like you learn to do in high school</span> <span
  m='1331870'>when you're a freshman.</span> </p><p><span m='1334470'>Now on
  Monday, we're going to talk about this program.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1336560'>And you're going to understand exactly how it works.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1338730'>And you can write one yourself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1341570'>And we're going to reach way back in time to look at that</span>
  <span m='1343730'>program because, in one day discussing it, talking
  about</span> <span m='1347400'>it, will be in itself a miniature
  artificial</span> <span m='1349500'>intelligence course.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1350360'>Because it's so rich with important ideas.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1355250'>So that's the dawn age, early dawn age.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1359310'>This was the age of speculation, and this was the</span> <span
  m='1369810'>dawn age in here.</span> </p><p><span m='1373820'>So in that early
  dawn age , the integration program took</span> <span m='1377600'>the world by
  storm.</span> </p><p><span m='1378390'>Because not everybody knows how to do
  integration.</span> </p><p><span m='1380280'>And someone, everyone, thought
  that if we can do integration</span> <span m='1383580'>today, the rest of
  intelligence will be figured</span> <span m='1385420'>out tomorrow.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1386882'>Too bad for our side it didn't work out that
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='1390580'>Here's another dawn age program, the
  Eliza</span> <span m='1394200'>[? thing ?].</span> </p><p><span
  m='1395220'>But I imagine you'd prefer a demonstration to</span> <span
  m='1397590'>just reading it, right?</span> </p><p><span m='1399455'>Do you
  prefer a demonstration?</span> </p><p><span m='1402870'>Let's see if we can
  demonstrate it.</span> </p><p><span m='1448250'>This is left over from a
  hamentashen debate of a couple</span> <span m='1451400'>of years ago.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1453411'>How do you spell hamentashen, anybody know?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1459450'>I sure hope that's right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1460600'>It doesn't matter.</span> </p><p><span m='1461390'>Something
  interesting will come.</span> </p><p><span m='1465920'>OK, your choice.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1468580'>Teal?</span> </p><p><span m='1471310'>Burton
  House?</span> </p><p><span m='1475890'>Teal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1487810'>So that's dawn age AI.</span> </p><p><span m='1489710'>And no one
  ever took that stuff seriously, except that</span> <span m='1493700'>it was a
  fun [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m='1494900'>project level thing to work out some
  matching</span> <span m='1497980'>programs, and so on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1499810'>The integration program was serious.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1501310'>This one wasn't.</span> </p><p><span m='1503240'>This was serious,
  programs that do geometric analogy,</span> <span m='1506940'>problems of the
  kind you find on intelligence tests.</span> </p><p><span m='1509020'>Do you
  have the answer to this?</span> </p><p><span m='1509990'>A is to B as C is to
  what?</span> </p><p><span m='1514260'>That would be 2, I guess.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1518270'>What's the second best answer?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1522070'>And the theories of the program that solve these</span> <span
  m='1524750'>problems are pretty much identical to what you just</span> <span
  m='1528990'>figured out.</span> </p><p><span m='1530460'>In the first case you
  deleted the inside figure.</span> </p><p><span m='1535970'>And the second case
  is, the reason you got four is because</span> <span m='1538280'>you deleted
  the outside part and grew the inside part.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1544340'>There's another one.</span> </p><p><span m='1546670'>I think this
  was the hardest one it got, or the easiest one</span> <span m='1549510'>it
  didn't get.</span> </p><p><span m='1550110'>I've forgotten.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1551300'>A is to B as C is to 3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1557490'>In the late dawn age, we began to turn our attention from</span>
  <span m='1560180'>purely symbolic reasoning to thinking a little bit
  about</span> <span m='1563010'>perceptual apparatus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1564600'>And programs were written that could figure out the nature
  of</span> <span m='1567410'>shapes and forms, such as that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1571800'>And it's interesting that those programs had the
  same</span> <span m='1574200'>kind of difficulty with this that you do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1579920'>Because now, having deleted all the edges,
  everything</span> <span m='1582410'>becomes ambiguous.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1583840'>And it may be a series of platforms, or it may be a</span> <span
  m='1586790'>series of--</span> <span m='1587615'>can you see the saw blade
  sticking up if you go through</span> <span m='1590520'>the reversal?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1593790'>Programs were written that could learn from a
  small</span> <span m='1595750'>number of examples.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1597600'>Many people think of computer learning as involving leading</span>
  <span m='1601490'>some neural net to submission with thousands of
  trials.</span> </p><p><span m='1606030'>Programs were written in the early
  dawn age that learned</span> <span m='1608280'>that an arch is something that
  has to have the flat part on</span> <span m='1611980'>top, and the two sides
  can't touch, and the top may or may</span> <span m='1615180'>not be a
  wedge.</span> </p><p><span m='1619630'>In the late dawn age, though, the most
  important thing,</span> <span m='1621880'>perhaps, was what you look at with
  me on Wednesday next.</span> </p><p><span m='1626302'>It's a rule-based expert
  systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1629120'>And a program was written at Stanford
  that did diagnosis of</span> <span m='1634740'>bacterial infections of the
  blood.</span> </p><p><span m='1636520'>It turned out to do it better than most
  doctors, most</span> <span m='1641040'>general practitioners.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1642860'>It was never used, curiously enough.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1646990'>Because nobody cares what your problem actually
  is.</span> </p><p><span m='1651360'>They just give you a broad spectrum
  antibiotic that'll</span> <span m='1653420'>kill everything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1656700'>But this late dawn age system, the so-called
  [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span m='1659700'>system, was the system that launched a
  thousand companies,</span> <span m='1666440'>because people started building
  expert systems built</span> <span m='1668960'>on that technology.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1670040'>Here's that you don't know you used, or that
  was</span> <span m='1672130'>used on your behalf.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1673430'>If you go through, for example, the Atlanta airport,</span> <span
  m='1676570'>your airplane is parked by a rule-based expert system that</span>
  <span m='1679380'>knows how to park aircraft effectively.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1683430'>It saves Delta Airlines about to $0.5 million a day of jet</span>
  <span m='1689841'>fuel by being all smarter about how to park them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1693780'>So that's an example of an expert system that does
  a</span> <span m='1695760'>little bit of good for a lot of people.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1699680'>There's Deep Blue.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1700600'>That takes us to the next stage beyond the age of expert</span>
  <span m='1707930'>systems, and the business age.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1710410'>It takes us into this age here, which I call the</span> <span
  m='1713250'>bulldozer age, because this is the time when people began
  to</span> <span m='1723260'>see that we had at our disposal</span> <span
  m='1726390'>unlimited amounts of computing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1728700'>And frequently you can substitute computing for</span> <span
  m='1730880'>intelligence.</span> </p><p><span m='1732930'>So no one would say
  that Deep Blue does anything like what a</span> <span m='1736420'>human chess
  master does.</span> </p><p><span m='1739230'>But nevertheless, Deep Blue, by
  processing data like a</span> <span m='1744180'>bulldozer processes gravel,
  was able to</span> <span m='1746700'>beat the world champion.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1751910'>So what's the right way?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1753100'>That's the age we're in right now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1755390'>I will of course be inducing programs for those ages as we</span>
  <span m='1758420'>go through the subject.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1759940'>There is a question of what age we're in right now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1762950'>And it's always dangerous to name an age when</span>
  <span m='1764840'>you're in it, I guess.</span> </p><p><span m='1766640'>I
  like to call at the age of the right way.</span> </p><p><span m='1770660'>And
  this is an age when we begin to realize that that</span> <span
  m='1773270'>definition up there is actually a little incomplete,</span> <span
  m='1776750'>because much of our intelligence has to do not</span> <span
  m='1781630'>with thinking, perception, and action acting separately,
  but</span> <span m='1787920'>with loops that tie all those together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1795510'>We had one example with Africa.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1797490'>Here's another example drawn from a program that has been</span>
  <span m='1802270'>under development, and continues to be, in my</span> <span
  m='1804960'>laboratory.</span> </p><p><span m='1811490'>We're going to ask the
  system to imagine something.</span> </p><p><span m='1818670'>SYSTEM:
  OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1819610'>I will imagine that a ball falls into a
  bowl.</span> </p><p><span m='1833098'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1833584'>I
  will imagine that a man runs into a woman.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1838930'>PATRICK WINSTON: You see, it does the best that it can if</span>
  <span m='1840240'>it doesn't have a good memory of what these
  situations</span> <span m='1843440'>actually involve.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1845005'>But having imagined the scene it can then--</span> <span
  m='1848130'>SYSTEM: Yes.</span> </p><p><span m='1848620'>I have learned from
  experience that contact between a man and</span> <span m='1852110'>a woman
  appeared because a man runs into a woman.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1856240'>PATRICK WINSTON: Having imagined the scene, it can</span> <span
  m='1858110'>then read the answers using its visual apparatus on the</span>
  <span m='1861740'>scene that it imagined.</span> </p><p><span m='1863580'>So
  just like what you did with Africa, only now it's working</span> <span
  m='1866530'>with its own visual memory, using visual programs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1872026'>SYSTEM: OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1872507'>I will
  imagine that a man gives a ball to a man.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1877330'>PATRICK WINSTON: I know this looks like slugs, but they're</span>
  <span m='1881050'>actually distinguished professors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1886500'>It always does the best it can.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1890465'>SYSTEM: OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1891451'>I will imagine that a
  man flies.</span> </p><p><span m='1899560'>PATRICK WINSTON: It's the best that
  it can do.</span> </p><p><span m='1907870'>So that concludes our discussion of
  the history.</span> </p><p><span m='1911920'>And I've provided you with a
  little bit of a glimpse of</span> <span m='1914240'>what we're going to look
  at as the semester unfolds.</span> </p><p><span m='1917880'>Yes, Chris?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1920410'>CHRIS: Is it actually a demonstration of
  something?</span> </p><p><span m='1923880'>Does it have a large database of
  videos?</span> </p><p><span m='1926200'>PATRICK WINSTON: No, it has a small
  database videos.</span> </p><p><span m='1928676'>CHRIS: But it's intelligently
  picking among them based on--</span> <span m='1933480'>PATRICK WINSTON: Based
  on their content.</span> </p><p><span m='1936140'>So if you say imagine that a
  student gave a ball to another</span> <span m='1940570'>student, it imagines
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='1943170'>You say, now does the other student have
  the ball?</span> </p><p><span m='1946430'>Does the other student take the
  ball?</span> </p><p><span m='1947590'>It can answer those questions because it
  can review the same</span> <span m='1950030'>video and see the take as well as
  the give in the same video.</span> </p><p><span m='1955760'>So now we have to
  think about why we ought to be optimistic</span> <span m='1962840'>about the
  future.</span> </p><p><span m='1964460'>Because we've had a long history here,
  and we haven't</span> <span m='1967210'>solved the problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1968830'>But one reason why we can feel optimistic about
  future is</span> <span m='1971350'>because all of our friends have been on the
  march.</span> </p><p><span m='1974580'>And our friends include the cognitive
  psychologists, the</span> <span m='1977950'>[? developmental ?]</span> <span
  m='1978930'>psychologists, the linguists, sometimes the philosophers,</span>
  <span m='1982200'>and especially the paleoanthropologists.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1986040'>Because it is becoming increasingly clear why we're</span> <span
  m='1989430'>actually different from the chimpanzees, and how we got to</span>
  <span m='1992780'>be that way.</span> </p><p><span m='1994690'>The high school
  idea is that we evolved through slow,</span> <span m='1999910'>gradual, and
  continuous improvement.</span> </p><p><span m='2003540'>But that doesn't seem
  to be the way it happened.</span> </p><p><span m='2005730'>There are some
  characteristics of our species that are</span> <span m='2010210'>informative
  when it comes to guiding the activities of</span> <span m='2014010'>people
  like me.</span> </p><p><span m='2016120'>And here's what the story seems to
  be</span> <span m='2017950'>from the fossil record.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2020600'>First of all, we humans have been around for maybe 200,000</span>
  <span m='2025330'>years in our present anatomical form.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2029210'>If someone walked through the door right now from 200,000</span>
  <span m='2033140'>years ago, I imagine they would be dirty,</span> <span
  m='2040990'>but other than that--</span> <span m='2043750'>probably naked,
  too--</span> <span m='2045100'>other than that, you wouldn't be able to tell
  the</span> <span m='2048070'>difference, especially at MIT.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2055840'>And so the ensuing 150,000 years was a period in
  which we</span> <span m='2061900'>humans didn't actually amount to
  much.</span> </p><p><span m='2065159'>But somehow, shortly before 50,000 years
  ago, some small</span> <span m='2070070'>group of us developed a capability
  that separated us</span> <span m='2074500'>from all other species.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2077520'>It was an accident of evolution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2080409'>And these accidents may or may not happen, but it happened
  to</span> <span m='2083310'>produce us.</span> </p><p><span m='2085199'>It's
  also the case that we probably necked down as a</span> <span
  m='2087920'>species to a few thousand, or maybe even a few hundred</span>
  <span m='2090600'>individuals, something which made these accidental
  changes,</span> <span m='2095219'>accidental evolutionary products,</span>
  <span m='2097210'>more capable of sticking.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2100500'>This leads us to speculate on what it was that happened</span>
  <span m='2102820'>50,000 years ago.</span> </p><p><span m='2104750'>And
  paleoanthropologists, Noam Chomsky, a lot of people</span> <span
  m='2110520'>reached similar conclusions.</span> </p><p><span m='2112580'>And
  that conclusion is--</span> <span m='2115050'>I'll quote Chomsky.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2116700'>He's the voice of authority.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2118990'>"It seems that shortly before 50,000 years ago, some small</span>
  <span m='2122020'>group of us acquired the ability to take two
  concepts,</span> <span m='2126040'>and combine them to make a third concept,
  without</span> <span m='2129020'>disturbing the original two concepts, without
  limit." And</span> <span m='2133540'>from a perspective of an AI person like
  me, what Chomsky</span> <span m='2137110'>seems to be saying is, we learned
  how to begin to</span> <span m='2139490'>describe things, in a way that was
  intimately</span> <span m='2142270'>connected with language.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2143790'>And that, in the end, is what separates us from
  the</span> <span m='2146360'>chimpanzees.</span> </p><p><span m='2149150'>So
  you might say, well let's just study language.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2150790'>No, you can't do that, because we think with our eyes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2153580'>So language does two things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2155510'>Number one, it enables us to make descriptions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2157790'>Descriptions enable us to tell stories.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2160040'>And storytelling and story understanding is what all
  of</span> <span m='2162400'>education is about.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2163730'>That's going up.</span> </p><p><span m='2164810'>And going down
  enables us to marshal the resources of our</span> <span m='2169370'>perceptual
  systems, and even command our perceptual systems</span> <span m='2172950'>to
  imagine things we've never seen.</span> </p><p><span m='2177450'>So here's an
  example.</span> </p><p><span m='2180120'>Imagine running down the street with
  a</span> <span m='2182420'>full bucket of water.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2184640'>What happens?</span> </p><p><span m='2187810'>Your leg gets
  wet.</span> </p><p><span m='2189100'>The water sloshes out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2190780'>You'll never find that fact anywhere on the
  web.</span> </p><p><span m='2194600'>You've probably never been told that
  that's what happens</span> <span m='2197470'>when you run down the street with
  a full bucket of water.</span> </p><p><span m='2199910'>But you easily imagine
  this scenario, and you know what's</span> <span m='2203400'>going to
  happen.</span> </p><p><span m='2203990'>There was internal imagination
  simulation.</span> </p><p><span m='2207150'>We're never going to understand
  human intelligence</span> <span m='2209030'>until we can understand
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='2211670'>Here's another example.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2212540'>Imagine running down the street with a</span> <span
  m='2213670'>full bucket of nickels?</span> </p><p><span m='2215620'>What
  happens?</span> </p><p><span m='2219460'>Nickels weigh a lot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2220415'>You're going to be bent over.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2221395'>You're going to stagger.</span> </p><p><span m='2223850'>But
  nobody ever told you that.</span> </p><p><span m='2225690'>You won't find it
  anywhere on the web.</span> </p><p><span m='2228080'>So language is at the
  center of things because it enables</span> <span m='2230720'>storytelling
  going up, and marshalling the resources of</span> <span m='2234380'>the
  perceptual apparatus, going down.</span> </p><p><span m='2238240'>And that's
  where we're going to finish the subject the</span> <span m='2240950'>semester,
  by trying to understand more about that</span> <span
  m='2243320'>phenomenon.</span> </p><p><span m='2245950'>So that concludes
  everything I wanted to say about the</span> <span m='2248150'>material and the
  subject.</span> </p><p><span m='2250520'>Now I want to turn my attention a
  little bit to how</span> <span m='2252290'>we are going to operate the
  subject.</span> </p><p><span m='2254090'>Because there are many
  characteristics of the subject</span> <span m='2256915'>that are
  confusing.</span> </p><p><span m='2263610'>First of all, we have four kinds
  of</span> <span m='2266840'>activities in the course.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2297930'>And each of these has a different purpose.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2319580'>So I did the lectures.</span> </p><p><span m='2320850'>And the
  lectures are supposed to be an hour about</span> <span m='2323910'>introducing
  the material and the big picture.</span> </p><p><span m='2326740'>They're
  about powerful ideas.</span> </p><p><span m='2332138'>They're about the
  experience side of the course.</span> </p><p><span m='2336060'>Let me step
  aside and make a remark.</span> </p><p><span m='2339130'>MIT is about two
  things.</span> </p><p><span m='2340390'>It's about skill building, and it's
  about big ideas.</span> </p><p><span m='2346200'>So you can build a skill at
  home, or at Dartmouth, or at</span> <span m='2350120'>Harvard, or Princeton,
  or all those kinds of places.</span> </p><p><span m='2353830'>But the
  experience you can only get at MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='2356280'>I know
  everybody there is to know in artificial</span> <span
  m='2358000'>intelligence.</span> </p><p><span m='2358940'>I can tell you about
  how they think.</span> </p><p><span m='2360190'>I can tell you about how I
  think.</span> </p><p><span m='2361250'>And that's something you're not going
  to</span> <span m='2362620'>get any other place.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2365120'>So that's my role, as I see it, in giving these lectures.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2369640'>Recitations are four buttressing and expanding
  on</span> <span m='2374160'>the material, and providing a venue that's small
  enough for</span> <span m='2377430'>discussion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2380540'>Mega recitations are [? a usual ?]</span> <span
  m='2382200'>components of the course.</span> </p><p><span m='2383380'>They're
  taught at the same hour on Fridays.</span> </p><p><span m='2386230'>Mark
  Seifter, my graduate student,</span> <span m='2388100'>will be teaching
  those.</span> </p><p><span m='2389510'>And those are wrapped around past quiz
  problems.</span> </p><p><span m='2393140'>And Mark will show you how to work
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='2395700'>It's very important component to the
  subject.</span> </p><p><span m='2400050'>And finally the tutorials are about
  helping</span> <span m='2402400'>you with the homework.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2404890'>So you might say to me, well, do I really</span> <span
  m='2409160'>need to go to class?</span> </p><p><span m='2411590'>I like to say
  that the answer is, only if you like to pass</span> <span m='2415170'>the
  subject.</span> </p><p><span m='2417870'>But you are MIT students.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2419920'>And MIT people always like to look at the
  data.</span> </p><p><span m='2426150'>So this is a scattergram we made after
  the subject was</span> <span m='2429640'>taught last fall, which shows the
  relationship between</span> <span m='2433010'>attendance at lectures and the
  grades awarded in the course.</span> </p><p><span m='2438680'>And if you're
  not sure what that all means, here's the</span> <span m='2440820'>regression
  line.</span> </p><p><span m='2446160'>So that information is a little suspect
  for two</span> <span m='2450400'>reasons, one of which is we asked people to
  self report on</span> <span m='2455520'>how many lectures they thought they
  attended.</span> </p><p><span m='2458330'>And our mechanism for assigning
  these numerical</span> <span m='2462340'>grades is a little weird.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2466560'>And there's a third thing, too, and that is, one
  must</span> <span m='2468470'>never confuse correlation with cause.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2472860'>You can think of other explanations for why
  that</span> <span m='2475150'>trend line goes up, different from whether it
  has something</span> <span m='2481230'>to do with lectures producing good
  grades.</span> </p><p><span m='2485840'>You might ask how I feel about the
  people up there on the</span> <span m='2488070'>other upper left hand
  corner.</span> </p><p><span m='2490580'>There are one or two people who were
  near the top of the</span> <span m='2492970'>subject who didn't go to class at
  all.</span> </p><p><span m='2497190'>And I have mixed feelings about
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='2500890'>You're adults.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2501550'>It's your call.</span> </p><p><span m='2503460'>On the other hand,
  I wish that if that's what you do</span> <span m='2506490'>habitually in all
  the subjects you take at MIT, that you</span> <span m='2509780'>would resign
  and go somewhere else, and let somebody else</span> <span m='2512450'>take
  their slot.</span> </p><p><span m='2513780'>Because you're not benefiting from
  the powerful ideas, and</span> <span m='2517050'>the other kinds of things
  that involve</span> <span m='2518930'>interaction with faculty.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2521150'>So it can be done.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2522350'>But I don't recommend it.</span> </p><p><span m='2523310'>By the
  way, all of the four activities that we have here</span> <span
  m='2526970'>show similar regression lines.</span> </p><p><span m='2531280'>But
  what about that five point scale?</span> </p><p><span m='2532930'>Let me
  explain how that works to you.</span> </p><p><span m='2534940'>We love to have
  people ask us what the class</span> <span m='2538060'>average is on a
  quiz.</span> </p><p><span m='2540430'>Because that's when we get to use our
  blank stare.</span> </p><p><span m='2543480'>Because we have no idea what the
  class average</span> <span m='2546180'>ever is on any quiz.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2548740'>Here's what we do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2566110'>Like everybody else, we start off with a score</span> <span
  m='2568660'>from zero to 100.</span> </p><p><span m='2570680'>But then we say
  to ourselves, what score would you get if</span> <span m='2574750'>you had a
  thorough understanding of the material?</span> </p><p><span m='2577260'>And we
  say, well, for this particular exam, it's this</span> <span m='2580400'>number
  right here.</span> </p><p><span m='2582480'>And what score would you get if
  you had a good</span> <span m='2584630'>understanding of the material?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2585500'>That's that score.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2587340'>And what happens if you're down here is that you're</span> <span
  m='2590040'>following off the edge of the range in which we think you</span>
  <span m='2592670'>need to do more work.</span> </p><p><span m='2594940'>So
  what we do is, we say that if you're in this range here--</span> <span
  m='2598830'>following MIT convention with GPAs and stuff,</span> <span
  m='2601520'>that gets you a five.</span> </p><p><span m='2603440'>If you're in
  this range down here, there's a</span> <span m='2605300'>sharp drop off to
  four.</span> </p><p><span m='2608170'>If you're in this range down here,
  there's a</span> <span m='2609710'>sharp fall off to three.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2613070'>So that means if you're in the middle of one of
  those</span> <span m='2614950'>plateaus there's no point in arguing with
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='2617790'>Because it's not going to do you any
  good.</span> </p><p><span m='2620550'>We have these boundaries where we think
  performance break</span> <span m='2623020'>points are.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2625430'>So you say, well that seems a little harsh.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2627870'>Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and start arguing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2629850'>But then we will come back with a second major
  innovation</span> <span m='2633560'>we have in the course.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2634860'>That is that your grade is calculated in several parts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2640300'>Part one is the max of your grade on Q1, and</span>
  <span m='2646970'>part one of the final.</span> </p><p><span m='2649830'>So in
  other words, you get two shots at everything.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2652780'>So if you have complete glorious undeniable horrible F</span>
  <span m='2658080'>on the first quiz, it gets erased on the final if you
  do</span> <span m='2661540'>well on that part of the final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2663910'>So each quiz has a corresponding</span> <span
  m='2665590'>mirror on the final.</span> </p><p><span m='2667080'>You get the
  max of the score you got on those two pieces.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2672680'>And now you say to me, I'm an MIT student.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2676540'>I have a lot of guts.</span> </p><p><span m='2678066'>I'm only
  going to take the final.</span> </p><p><span m='2684020'>It has been
  done.</span> </p><p><span m='2686060'>We don't recommend it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2689400'>And the reason we don't recommend it is that we
  don't</span> <span m='2691970'>expect everybody to do all of the final.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2693730'>So there would be a lot of time pressure if you had
  to do</span> <span m='2695740'>all of the final, all five parts of the
  final.</span> </p><p><span m='2700200'>So we have four quizzes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2702890'>And the final has a fifth part because there's some
  material</span> <span m='2705590'>that we teach you after the last date on
  which we can give</span> <span m='2708710'>you a final by institute
  rules.</span> </p><p><span m='2711010'>But that's roughly how it works.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2712050'>And you can read about more of the details in the FAQ
  on the</span> <span m='2716690'>subject homepage.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2719910'>So now we're almost done.</span> </p><p><span m='2721050'>I just
  want to talk a little bit about how we're going to</span> <span
  m='2724190'>communicate with you in the next few days, while we're</span>
  <span m='2727840'>getting ourselves organized.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2729710'>So, number one-- if I could ask the TAs to help me pass</span>
  <span m='2732560'>these out--</span> <span m='2734570'>we need to schedule you
  into tutorials.</span> </p><p><span m='2737890'>So we're going to ask you to
  fill out this form, and give</span> <span m='2739970'>it to us before you
  leave.</span> </p><p><span m='2744250'>So you'll be hearing from us once we do
  the sort.</span> </p><p><span m='2748910'>There's the issue of whether we're
  going to have ordinary</span> <span m='2758100'>recitation and a mega
  recitation this week.</span> </p><p><span m='2760500'>So pay attention.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2761460'>Otherwise, you're going to be stranded in a classroom
  with</span> <span m='2763630'>nothing to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2764990'>We're not going to have any regular recitations this week.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2770010'>Are we having regular recitation this week,</span>
  <span m='2771410'>[INAUDIBLE]?</span> </p><p><span m='2771720'>No.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2774270'>We may, and probably will, have a mega recitation
  this</span> <span m='2779890'>week that's devoted to a Python review.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2784480'>Now we know that there are many of you who are</span>
  <span m='2787810'>celebrating a religious holiday on Friday, and so we</span>
  <span m='2791250'>will be putting a lot of resources online so you can</span>
  <span m='2794680'>get that review in another way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2798060'>We probably will have a Python review on Friday.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2802740'>And we ask that you look at our home page for
  further</span> <span m='2805640'>information about that as the week
  progresses.</span> </p><p><span m='2809520'>So that's all folks.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2810640'>That concludes what we're going to do today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2812470'>And as soon as you give us your form, we're
  through.</span> </p><p></p>
