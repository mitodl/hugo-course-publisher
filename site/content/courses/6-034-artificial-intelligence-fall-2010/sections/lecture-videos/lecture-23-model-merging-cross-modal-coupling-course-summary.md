  <p><span m='9290'>PATRICK WINSTON: Well, don't stop.</span> </p><p><span
  m='10590'>Shoot.</span> </p><p><span m='12710'>I guess we've got to
  stop.</span> </p><p><span m='15280'>I will soon go into withdrawal symptoms
  that will</span> <span m='17310'>last about six weeks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='19890'>But, on the other hand, we all are beginning to develop a</span>
  <span m='22570'>sort of tired and desperate look.</span> </p><p><span
  m='25270'>And perhaps it's a good thing to get the semester behind us</span>
  <span m='29500'>and go into solstice hibernation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='32311'>Anyway, there's a lot to do today.</span> </p><p><span m='34250'>I
  want to wrap up a couple things, talk about what's</span> <span
  m='36490'>next, and maybe get into some big issues, perhaps a little</span>
  <span m='39720'>Genesis demo, that sort of thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='41990'>So here's what we're going to do first.</span> </p><p><span
  m='44150'>Last time, I talked about this whole idea</span> <span m='46730'>of
  structure discovery.</span> </p><p><span m='48440'>And really, the whole
  reason I cracked and started talking</span> <span m='51180'>about basic
  methods is because of the potential utility of</span> <span m='55620'>taking
  that idea one step further and finding structure</span> <span m='58790'>in
  situations where you might not otherwise find it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='63170'>It's still an open question about whether that's best way</span>
  <span m='65060'>to think about it.</span> </p><p><span m='65740'>But here it
  goes.</span> </p><p><span m='69690'>Imagine you've got a couple of
  stories.</span> </p><p><span m='72039'>And these circles represent the events
  in the story.</span> </p><p><span m='75630'>And now what you'd like to get out
  of these stories is some</span> <span m='78320'>kind of finite state graph
  that describes the collection</span> <span m='84080'>of stories.</span>
  </p><p><span m='85760'>So you might discover, for example, that these two
  events</span> <span m='90350'>are quite similar.</span> </p><p><span
  m='92200'>And these two events are quite similar.</span> </p><p><span
  m='95940'>So you might use that as a basis for speculating that</span> <span
  m='99420'>maybe a more compact way of representing the stuff in the</span>
  <span m='104080'>story would look like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='109020'>Where this one--</span> <span m='112690'>let's see.</span>
  </p><p><span m='113030'>This one goes with this one, this one goes with this
  one</span> <span m='117800'>and there's a possibility of another state in
  between.</span> </p><p><span m='121090'>So that's the notion of Bayesian story
  merging.</span> </p><p><span m='125090'>Now I'd like to show you a little bit
  more convincing</span> <span m='126810'>demonstration of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='128830'>Here's how it goes.</span> </p><p><span m='136765'>So
  there are the two stories.</span> </p><p><span m='138290'>This is just a
  classroom demonstration, no big deal.</span> </p><p><span m='141406'>But you
  can see there's a sort of parallel</span> <span m='143530'>structure in
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='145520'>So this is the work of a graduate
  student, Mark</span> <span m='147995'>Finlayson, who processed those stories
  to produce those kinds</span> <span m='153050'>of events and those kinds of
  events that get assembled into</span> <span m='156790'>two story
  graphs.</span> </p><p><span m='159600'>And the question is, is the most
  probable way of</span> <span m='163370'>explaining that corpus of
  stories?</span> </p><p><span m='165640'>And of course, the answer is
  no.</span> </p><p><span m='168140'>If you merge some things like chase and
  stop, then you get a</span> <span m='175680'>simpler graph, one that is more
  probable in the same</span> <span m='178980'>sense that we discussed last
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='181290'>Then you can merge run and flee because
  they're similar</span> <span m='183860'>kinds of events.</span> </p><p><span
  m='185880'>And finally, you've got think and decide.</span> </p><p><span
  m='188460'>Boom.</span> </p><p><span m='189980'>There is your story
  graph.</span> </p><p><span m='193310'>And this is the same idea taken several
  levels higher</span> <span m='196590'>that produce the capacity to discover,
  in these two</span> <span m='199180'>stories, the concept of revenge, as
  promised at the</span> <span m='203180'>beginning of our last
  discussion.</span> </p><p><span m='206860'>So sometimes the Bayesian stuff is
  the right thing to</span> <span m='209630'>do, especially if you don't know
  anything.</span> </p><p><span m='211960'>But sometimes you do know
  stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='214370'>And when you do know stuff it's possible
  that you can do</span> <span m='217320'>something very much more
  efficient.</span> </p><p><span m='219560'>This sort of thing takes clouds
  of</span> <span m='222200'>computers to process.</span> </p><p><span
  m='225130'>But we learned a lot of stuff in the course of our</span> <span
  m='227670'>development that we don't use a cloud of</span> <span
  m='229670'>computers to figure out.</span> </p><p><span m='232650'>We learned
  how to associate the gestures of our mouth with</span> <span m='239250'>the
  sounds that we make, for example.</span> </p><p><span m='242160'>So I want to
  spend a minute or two talking about some work</span> <span m='245200'>that
  someday will be the subject of a couple of</span> <span m='248790'>lectures, I
  think.</span> </p><p><span m='250586'>But it's the question of how to use
  multiple modalities and</span> <span m='258250'>correspondences between them
  to sort out both of the</span> <span m='263720'>contributing
  modalities.</span> </p><p><span m='265820'>That sounds contradictory.</span>
  </p><p><span m='266910'>Let me show you an example.</span> </p><p><span
  m='271940'>This is the example, a zebra finch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='273780'>And it's showing you the result of a program written by</span>
  <span m='279090'>Michael Coen, now a professor at the</span> <span
  m='280700'>University of Wisconsin.</span> </p><p><span m='283409'>So the male
  zebra finch learns to sing a nice mating song</span> <span m='289420'>from its
  daddy.</span> </p><p><span m='291159'>And this is what one such zebra finch
  sounds like.</span> </p><p><span m='294240'>[BIRD SONG PLAYING]</span> <span
  m='296690'>Nice, don't you think?</span> </p><p><span m='299100'>And here's
  what was learned by a program that uses no</span> <span
  m='302620'>probabilistic stuff at all, but rather the notion of</span> <span
  m='305150'>cross-modal coupling.</span> </p><p><span m='307528'>[BIRD SONG
  PLAYING]</span> <span m='309472'>Can you tell the difference?</span>
  </p><p><span m='312700'>It's not known if this particular song turns on
  the</span> <span m='315970'>female zebra finch.</span> </p><p><span
  m='317775'>But to the untrained human ear, they sure</span> <span
  m='321750'>sound a whole lot alike.</span> </p><p><span m='324550'>So how does
  that work?</span> </p><p><span m='326170'>Here's how that works.</span>
  </p><p><span m='332720'>Well, I'm not going to show you how that works.</span>
  </p><p><span m='334280'>What I'm going to show you is how the classroom
  example</span> <span m='337350'>works, the first chapter example in</span>
  <span m='339780'>Coen's Ph.D. Thesis.</span> </p><p><span m='341930'>Here's
  what happens.</span> </p><p><span m='343070'>When we talk, we produce a
  Fourier transform that moves</span> <span m='346740'>along with our
  speech.</span> </p><p><span m='348250'>And if we say a vowel like aah, you get
  a fairly constant</span> <span m='352250'>Fourier spectrum.</span>
  </p><p><span m='353930'>And you can say, well, where are the peaks in</span>
  <span m='355800'>that Fourier spectrum?</span> </p><p><span m='357080'>And how
  do they correspond to the appearance of my mouth</span> <span m='360260'>when
  I say the vowel?</span> </p><p><span m='362020'>So here's how that
  works.</span> </p><p><span m='368980'>So here's the Fourier spectrum of a
  particular vowel.</span> </p><p><span m='374130'>And when you smooth that,
  those</span> <span m='376530'>peaks are called formants.</span> </p><p><span
  m='378530'>And so we're just going to keep track of the first and</span> <span
  m='380710'>second formant.</span> </p><p><span m='382270'>But when I say those
  things, I also can form an ellipse</span> <span m='385660'>around my mouth
  when I say them.</span> </p><p><span m='388540'>And when I form an ellipse
  around my mouth when I say</span> <span m='390560'>them, that gives me this
  second modality.</span> </p><p><span m='395100'>So the question is, is there a
  way of associating the</span> <span m='399010'>gestures that produce the sound
  with the sound itself?</span> </p><p><span m='402690'>Well, there's the human
  data conveniently provided by a</span> <span m='406600'>variety of sources,
  including Michael Coen's wife who</span> <span m='410480'>produced the lip
  contour data on the right.</span> </p><p><span m='413300'>So that's all marked
  up and color coded according to the</span> <span m='417150'>particular vowels
  in English.</span> </p><p><span m='418320'>I guess there are ten of
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='421040'>So we humans all learn that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='423120'>But guess what?</span> </p><p><span m='423610'>We
  don't learn it from this.</span> </p><p><span m='425460'>Because we don't get
  to work with any marked up data.</span> </p><p><span m='429170'>We learn it
  from that.</span> </p><p><span m='431360'>Somehow we're exposed to the natural
  world, and we dig the</span> <span m='435710'>vowel sounds out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='437190'>It's fantastic how we do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='440890'>But we do have cross modal coupling data and maybe that's</span>
  <span m='443405'>got something to do with it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='445280'>So here is a particular cluster of sounds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='448345'>And what I want to know is, can I merge any of these two</span>
  <span m='450680'>clusters to form a bigger cluster with a</span> <span
  m='453260'>corresponding meaning?</span> </p><p><span m='455159'>So what I can
  do is, I can say, well, I can watch these.</span> </p><p><span m='459720'>I
  know what the lip form is when a</span> <span m='462740'>particular sound is
  made.</span> </p><p><span m='464780'>So I have these correspondences.</span>
  </p><p><span m='466770'>So maybe there are four of those, like so.</span>
  </p><p><span m='470780'>And maybe this same guy projects a couple</span> <span
  m='473980'>of tones into that.</span> </p><p><span m='478210'>And the question
  is, can this guy be combined with any of</span> <span m='483276'>these
  guys?</span> </p><p><span m='484190'>And the answer is yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='485510'>If they're close together on one side, maybe that
  suggests</span> <span m='488880'>you ought to cluster them on the other
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='491090'>But there's a question about what close
  means.</span> </p><p><span m='494830'>So let's suppose that we also look at
  how these guys, these</span> <span m='499760'>other two guys, project.</span>
  </p><p><span m='500555'>And suppose this guy projects twice up here</span>
  <span m='504310'>and once over here.</span> </p><p><span m='507280'>And this
  guy down here just projects like</span> <span m='510230'>crazy into that
  guy.</span> </p><p><span m='513380'>Which are closer?</span> </p><p><span
  m='516320'>These two or these two?</span> </p><p><span m='520510'>Well, my
  diagram's getting a little closer.</span> </p><p><span m='522190'>But if you
  paid attention when I was drawing it, you would</span> <span m='525380'>see
  that this guy projects in proportion to that guy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='530570'>So if we look at the-- if we take each of these projections</span>
  <span m='535030'>as the components of a vector, then those two vectors are
  in</span> <span m='539440'>the same direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='541380'>And the cosine between them is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='544020'>So these are the two that are closest together from that</span>
  <span m='548950'>sort of perspective of that kind of metric.</span>
  </p><p><span m='551460'>And those guys are the ones who get combined.</span>
  </p><p><span m='555106'>Would you like to see a demonstration?</span>
  </p><p><span m='556793'>Yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='557780'>OK, here's a
  demonstration based on Coen's work.</span> </p><p><span m='569960'>So here we
  have two sides.</span> </p><p><span m='572350'>We could think of one side as
  being vowel sounds and the</span> <span m='575572'>other side as being lip
  contours or something.</span> </p><p><span m='578930'>But you don't see
  anything in the diagram so far about how</span> <span m='582770'>these things
  ought to be sorted out into groups.</span> </p><p><span m='585490'>So if I
  just take one step, why, it discovers that those</span> <span m='589080'>two
  guys had the same projection</span> <span m='591760'>pattern as each
  other.</span> </p><p><span m='595700'>So if I take another step and do the
  same thing on the other</span> <span m='598860'>side, and now in the third
  step, the two areas that were</span> <span m='605130'>formerly combined now
  form a super area.</span> </p><p><span m='607920'>And they're seen to project
  in the same way as the blue area.</span> </p><p><span m='611260'>So using this
  kind of projection idea, I can</span> <span m='614640'>gradually build up an
  understanding of how those</span> <span m='617480'>regions go together.</span>
  </p><p><span m='623310'>And I discover, in this contrived example, that</span>
  <span m='626710'>there's a vertical arrangement on the right side that</span>
  <span m='629290'>corresponds to a horizontal arrangement on the left
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='632692'>Now, you say to me, I'd like to see
  something a little bit</span> <span m='634670'>more like the lip contour
  data.</span> </p><p><span m='637940'>I'm just stepping through here until I
  get</span> <span m='639890'>something I kind of like.</span> </p><p><span
  m='642400'>Oh, that sounds good.</span> </p><p><span m='644020'>That seems
  good.</span> </p><p><span m='646540'>So there's a correspondence here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='648420'>This is all made up data, Gaussians of various
  shapes</span> <span m='653730'>and orientations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='655920'>Let's see what happens when I run the clustering</span> <span
  m='658210'>algorithm on that.</span> </p><p><span m='665300'>Something
  definite was learned at every step.</span> </p><p><span m='667860'>We find the
  correspondence between the pink region on the</span> <span m='671290'>right
  and the pink region on the left.</span> </p><p><span m='673320'>In some cases,
  where the regions are rather blurred</span> <span m='675370'>together, the
  other side is the one that helps the system</span> <span m='677730'>figure out
  how things are organized.</span> </p><p><span m='681060'>So I cite this as an
  example of something I</span> <span m='683390'>think is very important.</span>
  </p><p><span m='684470'>Number one, it's possible to discover regularity
  without</span> <span m='689230'>being obsessively concerned with Bayesian
  probability.</span> </p><p><span m='692440'>And also, that there's very likely
  a whole lot of this</span> <span m='696940'>going on in human
  intelligence.</span> </p><p><span m='700480'>When we emerge and begin to
  examine and explore the world</span> <span m='705630'>around us, we're
  presented with a lot of unlabeled data</span> <span m='708520'>that we've got
  to make sense of.</span> </p><p><span m='710460'>And I believe that this kind
  of cross modal coupling idea</span> <span m='714540'>is very likely to be
  bound up in our understanding of that</span> <span m='721340'>world that's
  presented to us.</span> </p><p><span m='723000'>It's fast, it's direct.</span>
  </p><p><span m='724340'>It doesn't take thousands of data points.</span>
  </p><p><span m='726465'>It just happens.</span> </p><p><span m='728700'>And it
  happens effortlessly.</span> </p><p><span m='730450'>And if this isn't built
  in--</span> <span m='733434'>if this isn't determined to be built in, you can
  come back to</span> <span m='737700'>MIT in 15 years and put me and
  jail.</span> </p><p><span m='740470'>Because I think this is really the way it
  works.</span> </p><p><span m='743900'>So there it is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='744950'>There's a couple of things to have wrapped up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='747800'>And now the next thing I want to do for the rest of our last</span>
  <span m='754650'>time together in this format is talk to you about</span>
  <span m='757780'>a variety of things.</span> </p><p><span m='759200'>And I'll
  depart from my usual practice and</span> <span m='761690'>move to some
  slides.</span> </p><p><span m='763380'>So Dave, could we have the center
  screen, please?</span> </p><p><span m='776970'>So first, a brief review of
  where we've been and where</span> <span m='780900'>we've come.</span>
  </p><p><span m='783090'>I think in the very first class, I talked about
  what</span> <span m='785600'>artificial intelligence was.</span> </p><p><span
  m='787570'>And I talked about how you could view it from either an</span>
  <span m='789640'>engineering perspective or a scientific perspective.</span>
  </p><p><span m='792620'>I'm on the scientific perspective side.</span>
  </p><p><span m='794930'>And I think, nothing against applications, but I
  think</span> <span m='798730'>we'll be able to make much more sophisticated
  and</span> <span m='802820'>wonderful applications if we have not only the
  engineering</span> <span m='805970'>perspective about building stuff but also
  the scientific</span> <span m='809450'>perspective about understanding the
  stuff to</span> <span m='811250'>begin with.</span> </p><p><span m='814230'>So
  both perspectives are important.</span> </p><p><span m='816790'>And in this
  case you can see that they all involve</span> <span
  m='820590'>representations, methods, and architectures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='822770'>Dave, I've changed my mind.</span> </p><p><span m='824850'>Could
  you also give me the side screen so</span> <span m='826440'>I can see it
  too?</span> </p><p><span m='833320'>So, that's that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='835120'>What's next?</span> </p><p><span m='835750'>The business
  perspective, which we talked about on</span> <span
  m='837520'>Thanksgiving.</span> </p><p><span m='838120'>The important idea
  being that the knee-jerk expectation that</span> <span m='842950'>the
  commercial value of something is in replacing</span> <span m='845300'>people
  is something that is not sensible in the first</span> <span
  m='850850'>instance, and demonstrated to be unlikely and untrue in the</span>
  <span m='854250'>second instance.</span> </p><p><span m='855550'>The thing
  that turns people on from the point of view of</span> <span
  m='857380'>applications is not replacing people but making new revenue,</span>
  <span m='860790'>making new capability.</span> </p><p><span m='862760'>And
  that at once licenses you to not have something done</span> <span
  m='865570'>exclusively by a computer but something that can be done in</span>
  <span m='868620'>partnership with a person.</span> </p><p><span m='870506'>So
  all the important applications of artificial</span> <span
  m='873950'>intelligence involve people and computers working in</span> <span
  m='878210'>tandem, with each doing what they do best--</span> <span
  m='881740'>not with replacing people.</span> </p><p><span m='885170'>So that's
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='887410'>Here's what AI does that makes AI
  different from the rest of</span> <span m='890550'>the fields that attempt to
  contribute to an understanding</span> <span m='894370'>of intelligence.</span>
  </p><p><span m='896570'>Now, we have the benefit of having a language
  for</span> <span m='899010'>procedures.</span> </p><p><span m='901430'>We have
  all the metaphors that we are the custodians of in</span> <span
  m='907790'>consequences of knowing about programming.</span> </p><p><span
  m='910926'>We have the metaphor of garbage collection.</span> </p><p><span
  m='914410'>We can talk about all sorts of things with programming</span> <span
  m='916770'>metaphors that are unavailable to people in other fields
  that</span> <span m='922430'>are interested in psychology.</span> </p><p><span
  m='925360'>We have a way to make models because we can write programs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='928450'>And when we write programs, there's no question
  of</span> <span m='930280'>sweeping things under the rug.</span> </p><p><span
  m='931510'>We have to work out the details.</span> </p><p><span m='934690'>And
  once we've done all that, then we have opportunities to</span> <span
  m='936720'>experiment that are beyond the ability to experiment in most</span>
  <span m='942190'>other fields.</span> </p><p><span m='943580'>Oh, magnificent
  experiments are done these days in</span> <span m='945580'>developmental
  psychology and all the rest of--</span> <span m='949010'>all the other
  branches of psychology, including MRI</span> <span m='952020'>studies that
  probe into your brain and see how it's</span> <span m='954130'>consuming
  sugar.</span> </p><p><span m='957010'>But it's very difficult to ablate or
  take away some piece</span> <span m='959920'>of your knowledge and see how you
  work without it.</span> </p><p><span m='963840'>I can take the line-drawing
  program that we talked about</span> <span m='966600'>and say, how will it do
  if it doesn't know anything about</span> <span m='968820'>fork
  junctions?</span> </p><p><span m='970600'>And we can determine an
  answer.</span> </p><p><span m='973180'>But I can't reach into Sebastian's head
  here with a</span> <span m='975620'>surgical procedure and take out his</span>
  <span m='978350'>knowledge of fork junctions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='980525'>It just can't be done.</span> </p><p><span m='983270'>And finally,
  another reason why we're different is because</span> <span m='985730'>we can
  put upper bounds on how much knowledge is needed in</span> <span
  m='988460'>order to perform a certain kind of task.</span> </p><p><span
  m='991530'>These days, with bulldozer computing, the question most</span>
  <span m='994660'>often asked is, how can you get billions of the things
  off</span> <span m='999130'>the web and use them.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1001810'>We--</span> <span m='1002280'>I especially-- sometimes ask the
  opposite question, which</span> <span m='1005330'>is how little knowledge can
  you have and still</span> <span m='1009310'>understand a story?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1010550'>That's what's interesting to me.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1016630'>So there's a methodological slide that talks to the</span> <span
  m='1019810'>question of how you do artificial intelligence in</span> <span
  m='1022910'>particular and, I suppose, science in general,</span> <span
  m='1026890'>engineering in general.</span> </p><p><span m='1028770'>There's a
  great tendency in this field to fall in love</span> <span m='1031329'>with
  particular methods.</span> </p><p><span m='1032520'>And we've had people
  who've devoted entire careers to</span> <span m='1034964'>neural nets, genetic
  algorithms, Bayesian</span> <span m='1038520'>probability.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1040829'>And that's mechanism envy.</span> </p><p><span m='1043480'>And a
  better way, in my judgment, is to say, what is</span> <span m='1046579'>the
  problem?</span> </p><p><span m='1047170'>Scientific method-- what's the
  problem?</span> </p><p><span m='1048970'>And then bring the right machinery to
  bear on the</span> <span m='1051070'>problem, rather than looking for things
  to do with a</span> <span m='1053610'>particular kind of machinery.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1056580'>So this is the methodology that first articulated in
  a</span> <span m='1064080'>forceful way, by David Marr.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1066600'>You want to start with the competence you're trying to</span>
  <span m='1068120'>understand, then bring a representation to bear on
  it,</span> <span m='1072770'>a representation that exposes the constraints
  and</span> <span m='1074770'>regularities.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1075470'>Because without those, you can't make models.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1077230'>And without those models you can't understand it, explain</span>
  <span m='1081540'>it, predict it, or control it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1084010'>So it seems to make sense from a kind of MIT,
  model-centered</span> <span m='1088540'>point of view.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1090210'>And only when you've got all that straight do you start</span>
  <span m='1091980'>working on your methods and implement an experiment
  and</span> <span m='1094700'>then go around that loop.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1100330'>So that's all I want to say by way of review, I suppose.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1104320'>I want to take a minute or two and just remind you of
  what's</span> <span m='1108270'>on the final.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1108880'>And there's nothing to remind because you all know what's
  on</span> <span m='1111110'>the final already.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1112565'>We'll have four sections corresponding with four exams.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1117040'>Then we'll have a fifth and final question that will
  be</span> <span m='1119830'>everything else.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1121750'>All that stuff you slept through will be featured</span> <span
  m='1124760'>there, as well a little problem on Bayesian inference.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1131310'>We rearranged the subject, mostly so I could write
  the</span> <span m='1133950'>demonstrations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1136400'>So that the Bayesian stuff didn't come</span> <span
  m='1138770'>before the fourth quiz.</span> </p><p><span m='1140100'>Therefore
  the Bayesian stuff that you see on those previous</span> <span
  m='1143240'>quizzes is likely to be harder than the stuff that we'll
  ask</span> <span m='1146500'>on the final, because you haven't had as much
  experience</span> <span m='1148680'>with it as people did last year.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1151370'>I've got a few icons on there to remind me to</span>
  <span m='1153280'>tell you a few things.</span> </p><p><span m='1155200'>As
  always, open everything except for computers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1159130'>You can wear a costume.</span> </p><p><span m='1161680'>You can do
  anything you like as long as it doesn't disturb</span> <span m='1164670'>your
  neighbor, within reason.</span> </p><p><span m='1168650'>Well, I guess if it
  doesn't disturb neighbor,</span> <span m='1170650'>it is within reason.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1171680'>So maybe that's all I need to say.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1176270'>I'm not sure where we're going to be.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1177730'>But it's certainly the case that, historically, there
  are</span> <span m='1180920'>no visible clocks.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1182960'>So, we soon run out of all of our cellphones, wrist
  watches,</span> <span m='1186050'>and other time pieces as we hand them
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='1188450'>So it pays to remember to bring some kind
  of timepiece,</span> <span m='1192430'>because we won't be able to convey the
  time very well.</span> </p><p><span m='1196120'>And finally, I see a little
  calculator there.</span> </p><p><span m='1199050'>I don't recall any exam
  where you actually needed a</span> <span m='1201700'>calculator.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1202300'>But it's sort of a security blanket to have
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='1205270'>People sometimes see a problem and say,
  oh my God, what am I</span> <span m='1207510'>going to do?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1207960'>I left my calculator at home.</span> </p><p><span m='1210450'>So
  as to avoid that anxiety, you might want to bring one</span> <span
  m='1213990'>even though you won't need it.</span> </p><p><span m='1217070'>So
  that's the final.</span> </p><p><span m='1218590'>I'm sure there are no
  questions.</span> </p><p><span m='1220650'>Are there?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1221100'>It's obvious.</span> </p><p><span m='1222900'>Everybody will do
  well.</span> </p><p><span m='1225420'>Two shots, that whole thing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1229480'>Now, what to do next?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1230790'>Suppose this subject has turned you on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1233310'>There are a variety of things that you should be thinking</span>
  <span m='1235310'>about doing next semester.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1236345'>And I wanted to review just a few of those.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1239790'>One of them is Marvin Minsky's subject, Society of Mind.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1244770'>It's very different from this class.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1247920'>There are no prepared lectures.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1251450'>Marvin doesn't rehearse.</span> </p><p><span m='1253690'>He
  doesn't think about what he's going to say in advance.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1257950'>It's like this except it's just a</span> <span
  m='1260530'>conversation with Marvin.</span> </p><p><span m='1263000'>So many
  people find themselves bored stiff for two lectures</span> <span
  m='1267430'>out of three.</span> </p><p><span m='1268650'>But then in the
  third lecture, Marvin will say something that</span> <span m='1272720'>you'll
  think about for a year or for the rest of your life.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1275890'>That's what happens to me.</span> </p><p><span m='1277130'>I'm
  bored stiff two out three times.</span> </p><p><span m='1278870'>And then the
  third lecture he says something, and I think</span> <span m='1281560'>about it
  for at least a year and maybe permanently.</span> </p><p><span m='1285510'>So
  it's an opportunity to see one of MIT's true geniuses</span> <span
  m='1290500'>think out loud.</span> </p><p><span m='1292300'>So it's an
  experience that you don't want to miss because</span> <span m='1294130'>that's
  what you come here for, is to see the</span> <span m='1296470'>geniuses think
  out loud.</span> </p><p><span m='1299970'>Speaking of geniuses, then there's
  Bob Berwick.</span> </p><p><span m='1302530'>And he heroically is doing two
  subjects in the spring.</span> </p><p><span m='1307310'>Both of which I'd take
  if I could.</span> </p><p><span m='1309960'>One is his subject on Language
  Understanding.</span> </p><p><span m='1315090'>And the reason I'd take that is
  because I believe that</span> <span m='1316920'>language is at the center of
  any explanation of our</span> <span m='1319520'>intelligence.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1321100'>So that's the subject I would be, I suppose, most
  inclined</span> <span m='1324330'>to take if I were you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1326850'>Well, maybe Minsky's.</span> </p><p><span m='1328460'>It's hard to
  say.</span> </p><p><span m='1329330'>And incidentally, very heroically, Bob is
  also</span> <span m='1333450'>teaching a course on how evolution works,</span>
  <span m='1335800'>how it really works--</span> <span m='1337440'>in so far as
  we know how it really works--</span> <span m='1339860'>as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1340380'>So both of those will be offered in the
  spring.</span> </p><p><span m='1343130'>I don't know how he does it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1345630'>I don't know how he does two all at the same
  time.</span> </p><p><span m='1348720'>Of course there are lots of places where
  you can go to</span> <span m='1350200'>school, and the faculty will be
  teaching five courses at</span> <span m='1352770'>the same time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1353800'>I just think they're crazy or something.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1355260'>I don't know how that works.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1358110'>Gerry Sussman will be teaching his Large Scale Symbolic</span>
  <span m='1363290'>System subject.</span> </p><p><span m='1364890'>That's
  sometimes--</span> <span m='1366840'>oh, I forgot what he wasn't able to call
  it, something</span> <span m='1372600'>that wasn't politically correct about
  programming for</span> <span m='1375340'>people who really, really like to
  program.</span> </p><p><span m='1379700'>It's a splendid course on how to
  build really big systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1382700'>And we use the ideas
  in that subject in our research</span> <span m='1386250'>system, because it's
  the only way--</span> <span m='1387970'>understanding how that works is the
  only way that you can</span> <span m='1390010'>build systems that are too big
  to be built.</span> </p><p><span m='1392845'>I may say a word about that a
  little later.</span> </p><p><span m='1396050'>So those are my favorite
  three/four picks.</span> </p><p><span m='1401030'>But there's lots of other
  stuff, too</span> <span m='1402450'>many things to cover--</span> <span
  m='1404090'>the media lab, [INAUDIBLE]</span> <span
  m='1405700'>psychology.</span> </p><p><span m='1407020'>There's tons of stuff
  out there.</span> </p><p><span m='1409070'>And I would only mention that
  courses that have those three</span> <span m='1412550'>names on them are bound
  to be good.</span> </p><p><span m='1414880'>These are colleagues that I think
  I have a important</span> <span m='1417800'>perspective--</span> <span
  m='1418860'>not necessarily one I agree with, but an important</span> <span
  m='1420830'>perspective that you should understand--</span> <span
  m='1423000'>Richards, Tenenbaum, and Sinha.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1426300'>And now we come to my spring course, the Human Intelligence</span>
  <span m='1428590'>Enterprise.</span> </p><p><span m='1431000'>It's 6.XXX not
  because there's anything pornographic about it</span> <span m='1434190'>but
  because for a long time, I couldn't remember it's number.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1438580'>So I developed a habit of referring to it as 6.XXX and</span>
  <span m='1441610'>it seems to have stuck.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1445630'>Here's what that's about.</span> </p><p><span m='1453310'>Yeah,
  that might be interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='1454320'>It's taught like a
  humanities course, though.</span> </p><p><span m='1456330'>No lectures, I just
  talk.</span> </p><p><span m='1460320'>And all the TAs are veterans of that
  class so if you want</span> <span m='1463975'>to know if you should do it, you
  have several resources.</span> </p><p><span m='1468030'>You can talk to
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='1471390'>Or you could look at the sorts of things
  we talk about.</span> </p><p><span m='1477100'>Here are some things we talk
  about by way of packaging.</span> </p><p><span m='1485516'>Yeah, I can hear a
  little tittering there because people</span> <span m='1487940'>have discovered
  the last element.</span> </p><p><span m='1489810'>Some people take the whole
  subject because they want to</span> <span m='1491750'>be present for that
  unit.</span> </p><p><span m='1495460'>And we talk about all those kinds of
  things.</span> </p><p><span m='1497280'>And we look to see what the common
  elements are in all</span> <span m='1502370'>those kinds of packaging problems
  of the sort that you</span> <span m='1505335'>will face over and over again
  when you become an adult, no</span> <span m='1509290'>matter what you
  do.</span> </p><p><span m='1511470'>If you become a business person, an
  entrepreneur, a</span> <span m='1516010'>military officer, a scientist, or an
  engineer, that packaging</span> <span m='1521360'>stuff will often make the
  difference between whether you</span> <span m='1524280'>succeed or
  don't.</span> </p><p><span m='1528560'>And then, that's the second way you can
  figure out whether</span> <span m='1530750'>you want to take the
  subject.</span> </p><p><span m='1532480'>The content, the TAs, and then of
  course you can always</span> <span m='1536330'>appeal to the Underground
  Guide.</span> </p><p><span m='1539720'>And that's why it's very rare for
  someone that takes 6.XXX</span> <span m='1545080'>who hasn't been at this
  final lecture because they read the</span> <span m='1548290'>Underground
  Guide.</span> </p><p><span m='1551090'>Here is an element that appeared in the
  Underground</span> <span m='1554370'>Guide a few years back.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1566250'>There are no exams.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1570870'>But there is a tradition of hacking the Underground Guide.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1573930'>So this is another example of something that
  appeared.</span> </p><p><span m='1586230'>So it all came about because early
  in the teaching of</span> <span m='1588870'>6.XXX, I was whining to the
  students about the fact that</span> <span m='1592250'>I've been at MIT for a
  long time, since I was freshman.</span> </p><p><span m='1595490'>And I still
  have yet to have any person I report to say</span> <span m='1599480'>anything
  about my teaching--</span> <span m='1601210'>good, bad, indifferent.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1604230'>Nothing.</span> </p><p><span m='1605540'>Not a
  word.</span> </p><p><span m='1607010'>So the students decided that it would be
  interesting to see</span> <span m='1609950'>if they could say something
  sufficiently outrageous to</span> <span m='1612400'>force a conversation
  between the department</span> <span m='1615140'>chairman and me.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1617750'>And so far they've been totally unsuccessful.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1620730'>And I've tried everything.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1623490'>Winston shows up late if he shows up at all.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1629710'>Good instructor but constantly sipping from</span> <span
  m='1631740'>a brown paper bag.</span> </p><p><span m='1636900'>All kinds of
  stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='1640360'>But there it is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1641430'>It's a lot of fun.</span> </p><p><span m='1642910'>It's a little
  oversubscribed so we have to have a lottery</span> <span m='1646220'>and
  there's about 50% chance and so on and so forth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1648560'>But many of you will find it a good thing to do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1657340'>Oh, yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='1657780'>And now I
  also want to remind myself that there is a IP</span> <span m='1662150'>event
  that's become kind of MIT tradition.</span> </p><p><span m='1664690'>It's the
  How to Speak lecture that I give.</span> </p><p><span m='1667030'>This year
  it'll be on January 28 in 6120.</span> </p><p><span m='1671690'>6120 holds
  about 120 people and about 250 show up.</span> </p><p><span m='1679850'>So if
  you want to go to that lecture you should show up 15</span> <span
  m='1682670'>minutes early.</span> </p><p><span m='1683380'>That's a little
  secret just between me and 6034 students.</span> </p><p><span m='1689030'>It's
  about packaging, too.</span> </p><p><span m='1690990'>It's a one-lecture
  version of 6.XXX.</span> </p><p><span m='1694350'>But it's very nonlinear
  because one thing that you</span> <span m='1696890'>pick up from that one hour
  may make the difference between</span> <span m='1700860'>you getting the job
  and some other slug getting the job.</span> </p><p><span m='1704480'>So it's
  one of those sorts of things that can make a big</span> <span
  m='1709240'>difference in a short period of time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1711670'>You may sleep through 50 minutes of the 55 minutes in</span> <span
  m='1714240'>that lecture and stay awake for that one magical five</span> <span
  m='1717450'>minutes when you learn something about when to tell a</span> <span
  m='1720250'>joke or how to open a lecture or how to conclude one or a</span>
  <span m='1725870'>job talk or a sales presentation or anything.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1730400'>And that will make it worthwhile for you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1733580'>And then of course there's the possibility of
  your--</span> <span m='1736440'>anybody who's doing [? UROP ?]</span> <span
  m='1737530'>with me is likely to be interested in what I've</span> <span
  m='1742000'>recently come to call a strong story hypothesis, something</span>
  <span m='1746600'>that we've talked about from time to time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1752470'>That's what makes us humans, and that's not what they
  are.</span> </p><p><span m='1755470'>They're orangutans or chimpanzees, even
  though the</span> <span m='1758630'>DNA that we share is--</span> <span
  m='1761020'>it goes up and down.</span> </p><p><span m='1762580'>At one point
  it was 96%, then it went to 98%.</span> </p><p><span m='1765760'>Now I think
  it's back down to 97%.</span> </p><p><span m='1768610'>But whatever we are,
  it's not because of a huge, massive</span> <span m='1772160'>difference in DNA
  between us and our cousins.</span> </p><p><span m='1776380'>So in my group we
  build a Genesis</span> <span m='1779870'>system, modestly called.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1782300'>And that's what it looks like.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1785950'>And it has in it all the sorts of things that we've talked</span>
  <span m='1788490'>about from time to time in 6034.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1792100'>And it's about to move into areas that are especially</span> <span
  m='1795730'>interesting, like can you detect the onset of a possible</span>
  <span m='1800250'>disaster before it happens and intervene?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1803110'>Can you retrieve presses based on higher-level
  concepts?</span> </p><p><span m='1806580'>Things of that sort.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1810090'>Would you like to see a demonstration?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1813910'>OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1814180'>So you've see in
  a little bit of this before.</span> </p><p><span m='1815700'>In fact, I'm not
  even sure what exactly I've</span> <span m='1819410'>already shown you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1820060'>Let me just get over there to see what goes on
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1824396'>What I'm going to do right now is I'm
  just going to read</span> <span m='1829680'>about Macbeth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1831222'>A short precis of the plot.</span> </p><p><span m='1834220'>Not
  the whole thing, of course.</span> </p><p><span m='1836060'>Just a few
  sentences about the plot.</span> </p><p><span m='1840630'>Right now what it's
  doing is absorbing the English and</span> <span m='1843420'>translating into a
  sort of internal language.</span> </p><p><span m='1846612'>A sort of
  universal, internal language that's all about</span> <span
  m='1850500'>trajectories and transitions and social</span> <span
  m='1853280'>relationships and all that.</span> </p><p><span m='1855370'>So
  it's being read there by two different persona.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1860800'>Each of those personas has a different educational</span> <span
  m='1864000'>background, you might say.</span> </p><p><span m='1865040'>They
  might represent different cultures.</span> </p><p><span m='1868690'>So
  eventually they build up graphs like that.</span> </p><p><span m='1872060'>And
  everything in white is stuff that's</span> <span m='1873790'>explicit in the
  story.</span> </p><p><span m='1875580'>And everything that's in grey is stuff
  that's been inferred</span> <span m='1879495'>by the system.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1881520'>So there are several layers of understanding.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1883220'>One is what's there explicitly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1886040'>And the other thing that's there is stuff</span> <span
  m='1887510'>that's readily inferred.</span> </p><p><span m='1889415'>And
  because these persona have different educational</span> <span
  m='1892350'>backgrounds, you might say they see the killing of</span> <span
  m='1897681'>Macbeth at the end of the play in a different</span> <span
  m='1901490'>light from one another.</span> </p><p><span m='1903540'>One sees
  it as an act of insane violence and the other</span> <span m='1905870'>sees it
  as a consequence of a revenge.</span> </p><p><span m='1910440'>So once you've
  got that capability, you can do all</span> <span m='1912680'>sorts of
  things.</span> </p><p><span m='1913240'>For example, you can ask
  questions.</span> </p><p><span m='1916470'>So let me arrange it to ask-- by
  the way, this is a live</span> <span m='1919080'>demonstration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1919455'>I'm thrilled to pieces that it actually works so
  far.</span> </p><p><span m='1923250'>Let's see.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1924050'>Why did Macbeth kill Duncan?</span> </p><p><span m='1936600'>You
  all know why, right?</span> </p><p><span m='1942430'>Yeah, you're
  right.</span> </p><p><span m='1943400'>He didn't actually do that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1944400'>On a common sense level, neither Dr. Jeckll nor
  Mr.</span> </p><p><span m='1947400'>Hyde have an opinion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1949065'>On a reflective level neither Dr. Jeckll more Mr. Hyde have</span>
  <span m='1952420'>an opinion.</span> </p><p><span m='1953000'>That's because
  it didn't happen.</span> </p><p><span m='1955580'>So we call these two persona
  Doctor Jeckll and Mr. Hyde.</span> </p><p><span m='1961280'>And you're ready
  to complain right away about the spelling</span> <span m='1963620'>of Jeckll,
  aren't you?</span> </p><p><span m='1964990'>Well, that's because with this
  spelling the speech generator</span> <span m='1969220'>makes it sound a little
  bit more like when we say Jekyll.</span> </p><p><span m='1973550'>But what
  really happened is that Macduff killed Macbeth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1979820'>On a common sense level, it looks like Dr. Jeckll thinks</span>
  <span m='1982520'>Macduff kills Macbeth because Macduff is insane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1985730'>It looks like Mr. Hyde thinks Macduff kills Macbeth
  because</span> <span m='1988570'>Macbeth angers Macduff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1990710'>On a reflective level, it looks like Dr. Jeckll thinks</span>
  <span m='1993410'>Macduff kills Macbeth as part of an act of insane
  violence.</span> </p><p><span m='1997460'>It looks like Mr. Hyde thinks
  Macduff kills Macbeth as part</span> <span m='2000700'>of acts of mistake,
  Pyrrhic victory, and revenge.</span> </p><p><span m='2004180'>Isn't that
  cool?</span> </p><p><span m='2005440'>I bet you'd get an A if you had said
  that in eighth grade.</span> </p><p><span m='2013670'>But once you've got this
  ability to understand the</span> <span m='2017500'>story from multiple points
  of view, you begin to think of</span> <span m='2019380'>all kinds of wonderful
  things you can do.</span> </p><p><span m='2022090'>For example, you can have
  Dr. Jeckll negotiate with Mr.</span> </p><p><span m='2025610'>Hyde, because
  Dr. Jeckll will be able to understand Mr.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2028950'>Hyde's point of view and demonstrate to Mr. Hyde that</span> <span
  m='2033220'>he thinks that point of view is legitimate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2037960'>Or, Dr. Jeckll can teach Mr. Hyde the subject matter of a</span>
  <span m='2042650'>new domain.</span> </p><p><span m='2044740'>Or Dr. Jeckll
  can watch what's happening in Mr. Hyde's mind</span> <span m='2050290'>and
  avert disaster before it happens.</span> </p><p><span m='2053020'>So let me
  just show you another situation here.</span> </p><p><span m='2057770'>I want
  to turn on the onset detector and read another</span> <span m='2060630'>little
  snippet.</span> </p><p><span m='2061219'>This one is about--</span> <span
  m='2063620'>what should I do?</span> </p><p><span m='2067610'>We'll do the
  Russia and Estonia cyber war.</span> </p><p><span m='2072900'>It's reading
  background knowledge right now.</span> </p><p><span m='2075820'>But pretty
  soon, in the upper left-hand corner, as it begins</span> <span m='2077850'>to
  read the story, you'll see it spotting the onset of</span> <span
  m='2081250'>potential revenge operations or potential Pyrrhic</span> <span
  m='2083739'>victories, and show their foundations begin to emerge</span> <span
  m='2089370'>and giving the system an opportunity to intervene.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2094790'>So there you can see all the things that it</span>
  <span m='2096540'>thinks might happen.</span> </p><p><span m='2099690'>Not all
  of them do happen.</span> </p><p><span m='2101370'>But some of them do.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2102773'>And you'll note, incidentally, that this is another
  case of</span> <span m='2106820'>Dr. Jeckll and Mr. Hyde having different
  cultural</span> <span m='2108900'>perspectives.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2110440'>One's an ally of Russia and one's an ally of Estonia.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2113300'>One sees it as unwarranted revenge and the other sees
  it</span> <span m='2115650'>as teaching a lesson.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2119720'>So, I don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='2121480'>What else have
  we got here?</span> </p><p><span m='2123970'>Oh yeah, president recall.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2126540'>A long time ago, we talked about doing
  information</span> <span m='2128880'>retrieval based on vectors of keyword
  counts.</span> </p><p><span m='2133210'>That's cool but not this cool.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2134860'>This is doing it on vectors of concepts that appear
  in the</span> <span m='2137780'>stories, such as revenge, even though the word
  revenge</span> <span m='2141540'>doesn't appear anywhere.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2143160'>So because we're able to understand the story on</span> <span
  m='2145750'>multiple levels, we can use those higher levels that don't</span>
  <span m='2148860'>involve the words in the story at all to drive</span> <span
  m='2152010'>the retrieval process.</span> </p><p><span m='2154980'>So all that
  is a consequence of a variety of things, one of</span> <span m='2158510'>which
  is the specialists that translate the English into an</span> <span
  m='2164340'>internal language.</span> </p><p><span m='2166200'>And it's also,
  incidentally--</span> <span m='2167360'>I mentioned it a little
  before--</span> <span m='2169330'>it's also a consequence of our use of Gerry
  Sussman's</span> <span m='2173910'>propagator architecture.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2175740'>So a student comes into our group and says</span>
  <span m='2177465'>he wants to do something.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2178060'>And we say OK, here's how the system is organized.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2181870'>It's like a bunch of boxes that are wired
  together.</span> </p><p><span m='2185560'>So you get a box and we'll tell you
  what the inputs are</span> <span m='2188250'>going to look like.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2189300'>And we'll tell you what we want on the
  outputs.</span> </p><p><span m='2190690'>And if you don't like the inputs,
  just ignore them.</span> </p><p><span m='2194370'>And if we don't like your
  outputs,</span> <span m='2195630'>we'll just ignore that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2196500'>So nobody can screw up anything because they have a</span> <span
  m='2199210'>very circumscribed piece of the system to work with.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2203520'>So I can say, for example, the president wanted Iraq
  to move</span> <span m='2212110'>toward democracy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2216490'>And bingo.</span> </p><p><span m='2217120'>That starts a
  propagation through that network.</span> </p><p><span m='2226730'>All this
  would be unconvincing, in my view, if</span> <span m='2229802'>it weren't
  eventually connected to perception.</span> </p><p><span m='2231810'>Because if
  it's not eventually connected with perception,</span> <span m='2234270'>it's
  yet another system that demonstrates how smart it can</span> <span
  m='2237580'>seem to be without actually knowing anything.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2240420'>So another half of what we do is an early stage attempt to</span>
  <span m='2245780'>connect the language stuff with things that are going
  on</span> <span m='2248410'>in the world.</span> </p><p><span m='2250720'>So
  we say, imagine a jumping action.</span> </p><p><span m='2252950'>And there is
  a jumping action that's part of a test sweep</span> <span
  m='2256640'>developed by the Defense Research Projects Agency to</span> <span
  m='2259240'>drive what they call the Mind's Eye program, which was</span>
  <span m='2263120'>developed largely as a consequence of work done here</span>
  <span m='2265090'>at MIT, focused on the idea that if we're going to</span>
  <span m='2267770'>understand the nature of intelligence, we have to</span>
  <span m='2270370'>understand how language is coupled into our
  perceptual</span> <span m='2274090'>systems and how those perceptual systems
  can answer</span> <span m='2276580'>questions posed to them by the language
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='2286000'>That's a little demo of the Genesis
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='2287710'>Here are the issues that we're trying
  to explore.</span> </p><p><span m='2289740'>Nothing too serious, just the
  nature of what is</span> <span m='2292530'>extraordinarily fundamental to
  any</span> <span m='2294270'>explanation of human thinking.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2300860'>Now, all of this might turn you on.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2303050'>And you say to me, well, you're sick and tired of
  MIT.</span> </p><p><span m='2306370'>You'd like to go somewhere else for
  graduate school.</span> </p><p><span m='2308290'>So now that I've demonstrated
  what we do here, one of the</span> <span m='2311900'>many things we do here,
  I'll talk a little bit about other</span> <span m='2314360'>places you can
  go.</span> </p><p><span m='2315200'>This is a sort of MIT-centric view of the
  world.</span> </p><p><span m='2321450'>It represents all of the places you
  could go</span> <span m='2323250'>when I was a kid.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2327310'>But while I've got this particular</span> <span
  m='2328490'>diagram on here, I just--</span> <span m='2329990'>sort of testing
  my MIT arrogance--</span> <span m='2331670'>I remember a story often told by
  my</span> <span m='2334330'>colleague Peter Szolovits.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2336025'>He says that when he came to a job interview from Caltech
  to</span> <span m='2339770'>MIT, he was sitting here for three days and</span>
  <span m='2342330'>nobody spoke to him.</span> </p><p><span m='2343210'>So
  eventually he said, I've got to do something.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2346740'>He walked up to a graduate student and said, hi my name</span>
  <span m='2349960'>is Peter Szolovits.</span> </p><p><span m='2351375'>I'm from
  Caltech.</span> </p><p><span m='2353370'>And the graduate student said,
  Caltech</span> <span m='2354940'>sucks, and walked away.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2359780'>Anyway, we've populated all these places now that you see</span>
  <span m='2363740'>here, and more.</span> </p><p><span m='2365040'>This is just
  a list that I scratched up this morning.</span> </p><p><span m='2366910'>I'm
  sure I've forgotten many that have equal right</span> <span m='2372490'>to be
  on this list.</span> </p><p><span m='2374810'>But in the end, which one you go
  to depends on who you want</span> <span m='2378190'>to apprentice yourself
  to.</span> </p><p><span m='2380270'>Because a graduate school is an
  apprenticeship.</span> </p><p><span m='2383100'>And that means if you go to a
  place with just one person,</span> <span m='2385560'>it's OK if that's the
  person you want to apprentice</span> <span m='2387990'>yourself to.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2389210'>Each of these places has a different focus because
  they</span> <span m='2391450'>have different people.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2393790'>So you need to find out if there's somebody at any of</span> <span
  m='2396260'>these places.</span> </p><p><span m='2396900'>It doesn't matter if
  it's AI or some other field.</span> </p><p><span m='2400340'>Theoretical
  physic-- you've got to find out if there's</span> <span m='2401930'>somebody
  at that place you want to</span> <span m='2403570'>apprentice yourself
  to.</span> </p><p><span m='2404480'>So those site visits are really
  important.</span> </p><p><span m='2407380'>And I would like to also stress
  that when you make your</span> <span m='2409110'>application to graduate
  school, it's very different</span> <span m='2413310'>from applying to
  undergraduate school.</span> </p><p><span m='2416030'>Because they don't care
  whether their school is good</span> <span m='2418870'>for you at all.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2421650'>They only care about one thing--</span> <span
  m='2423480'>whether you're good for their school.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2426450'>So don't get confused and talk about how it's a</span> <span
  m='2428190'>wonderful fit for you.</span> </p><p><span m='2429060'>Because
  what they're interested in is whether</span> <span m='2430360'>you're going to
  contribute to their research program.</span> </p><p><span m='2435860'>Oh, I
  should say that if you're applying to artificial</span> <span
  m='2437490'>intelligence that means you don't say, I'm interested in</span>
  <span m='2440870'>all aspects of thinking.</span> </p><p><span m='2442900'>You
  need to be focused.</span> </p><p><span m='2446240'>There's another reason why
  you don't say that you're</span> <span m='2447630'>interested in all aspects
  of thinking and that is the</span> <span m='2450180'>defect theory of AI
  career selection.</span> </p><p><span m='2453820'>It seems to be the case,
  strange though it may seem,</span> <span m='2457800'>that people in artificial
  intelligence often specialize</span> <span m='2460960'>their research on the
  things that they don't do very well</span> <span
  m='2463050'>themselves.</span> </p><p><span m='2464880'>So people who study
  language, with the exception of Bob</span> <span m='2467020'>Berwick, often
  have trouble getting</span> <span m='2469790'>out a coherent sentence.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2472180'>And people who do hand-eye coordination are the sorts
  who</span> <span m='2476140'>spill their coffee.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2478540'>So don't say you want to study all thinking because--</span> <span
  m='2484530'>The most extreme case of this, though, is--</span> <span
  m='2488390'>if you don't mind, I'll tell you a story about an extreme</span>
  <span m='2490370'>case in this.</span> </p><p><span m='2491740'>We had a
  visitor from Japan in the old artificial</span> <span m='2494360'>intelligence
  lab many years ago.</span> </p><p><span m='2495920'>He came for a year.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2497000'>Let's call him Yoshiaki, just to pick a name.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2502080'>Yoshiaki spent a year at the artificial intelligence
  lab,</span> <span m='2504760'>and he left his wife in Japan.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2508300'>And the reason was, she was pregnant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2510752'>And at that time, you could not get a visa to the
  United</span> <span m='2514360'>States unless you had a smallpox
  vaccination.</span> </p><p><span m='2517240'>And because she was pregnant, she
  didn't want to get a</span> <span m='2518990'>smallpox vaccination because
  there's a small danger to the</span> <span m='2523650'>fetus if you get a
  smallpox vaccination</span> <span m='2525485'>while you're pregnant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2527000'>So she stayed back there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2529060'>So Yoshiaki, let us call him--</span> <span m='2531580'>it was a
  day before he was to get on the</span> <span m='2532960'>airplane to go
  home.</span> </p><p><span m='2533950'>I walked into his office and his desk
  was covered with</span> <span m='2537190'>pictures of his wife.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2539080'>By the way, Yoshiaki, I should tell you, is a
  computer vision</span> <span m='2541630'>guy, interested in object
  recognition.</span> </p><p><span m='2547070'>So you might suspect he has some
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2549030'>So he's looking at these
  pictures.</span> </p><p><span m='2550140'>I thought, oh my God, this is a
  tender moment.</span> </p><p><span m='2551880'>He's anticipating his return to
  Japan and</span> <span m='2555140'>reunion with his wife.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2557140'>So I muttered something to that effect.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2559620'>And then he looked at me like I was the king of the fools.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2562530'>And he said, it's not a question tenderness.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2565470'>I'm afraid I won't recognize her at the Tokyo
  airport.</span> </p><p><span m='2569880'>So I said, Yoshiaki.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2572220'>How can this be?</span> </p><p><span m='2572720'>You
  study computer vision.</span> </p><p><span m='2574260'>You study object
  recognition.</span> </p><p><span m='2575930'>This is your wife.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2578400'>How can you think you wouldn't recognize her</span>
  <span m='2580395'>at the Tokyo airport?</span> </p><p><span m='2583220'>And
  then he looks at me, and--</span> <span m='2584370'>God is my witness-- he
  says, they all look alike.</span> </p><p><span m='2596760'>Well now as we come
  close to the end,</span> <span m='2598860'>what are the big questions?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2599680'>Is it useful?</span> </p><p><span m='2600130'>Of
  course it's useful.</span> </p><p><span m='2601310'>It's part of the toolkit,
  now, of everybody who claims to be</span> <span m='2603630'>a computer
  scientist.</span> </p><p><span m='2605310'>What are the powerful ideas and
  these things?</span> </p><p><span m='2606730'>Well, here's the most powerful,
  powerful idea is the</span> <span m='2610290'>idea of powerful idea.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2613200'>And here are a few of my favorites.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2617900'>No surprises there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2618930'>That's just Winston's picks.</span> </p><p><span m='2623030'>But
  there's one more I would like to add.</span> </p><p><span m='2625340'>And that
  is all great ideas are simple.</span> </p><p><span m='2628100'>A lot of times
  we at MIT confuse value with complexity.</span> </p><p><span m='2631770'>And
  many of the things that were the simplest in this</span> <span
  m='2633660'>subject are actually the most powerful.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2636860'>So be careful about confusing simplicity with triviality
  and</span> <span m='2645160'>thinking that something can't be important unless
  it's</span> <span m='2647000'>complicated and deeply mathematical.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2649580'>It's usually the intuition that's powerful, and
  the</span> <span m='2653270'>mathematics is the [INAUDIBLE] element.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2658080'>Sometimes people argue that real intelligence is
  possible.</span> </p><p><span m='2662090'>One of the most common arguments is,
  well what if we</span> <span m='2664700'>had a room?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2666170'>And you're in the room and you're asked to translate some</span>
  <span m='2668630'>Chinese documents.</span> </p><p><span m='2669890'>You've
  got a bunch of books.</span> </p><p><span m='2673490'>And in the end you could
  do the translation.</span> </p><p><span m='2674920'>But you cannot be said to
  understand Chinese.</span> </p><p><span m='2677750'>This is the argument of
  Berkeley</span> <span m='2683260'>philosopher named Sorel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2686960'>So the trouble is, it's also true--</span> <span m='2689200'>well,
  the argument is the books aren't intelligent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2692950'>They're just ink on a page.</span> </p><p><span m='2694900'>And
  the person is just a computer, just a processor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2698300'>It doesn't actually know anything.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2701360'>So since it can't be in either the person or the</span> <span
  m='2703660'>books, it can't be.</span> </p><p><span m='2705436'>And that just
  forgets that there's a magic that comes</span> <span m='2710410'>about when a
  running program, when a process, executes in</span> <span m='2714940'>time
  over knowledge that it continually contributes to.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2718980'>So the reductionist arguments are among the many that have</span>
  <span m='2722680'>been ineffectually posed to argue that artificial</span>
  <span m='2726630'>intelligence is impossible.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2730170'>But that bears longer discussion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2732990'>Let me just bring up the biggest issue in my mind,</span> <span
  m='2735980'>which is, it's not the question of whether we humans</span> <span
  m='2740890'>are too smart to have our intelligence duplicated or</span> <span
  m='2745260'>excelled in a computer.</span> </p><p><span m='2746180'>It's a
  question whether we're smart enough to pull it off.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2749780'>I once had a pet raccoon.</span> </p><p><span m='2754096'>Now,
  it's illegal to have a pet raccoon.</span> </p><p><span m='2756110'>But this
  one was an orphan.</span> </p><p><span m='2758710'>Its mother had been hit by
  a car or something.</span> </p><p><span m='2761510'>A friend of mine brought
  the raccoon to me knowing I kind</span> <span m='2763772'>of like
  animals.</span> </p><p><span m='2765900'>And I have to say, I kept the raccoon
  for a year.</span> </p><p><span m='2768600'>At that point, she wanted to go
  out and be on her own.</span> </p><p><span m='2773250'>So I had this
  raccoon.</span> </p><p><span m='2774840'>And this raccoon is smarter than any
  dog I've ever had.</span> </p><p><span m='2777760'>Within a day, she learned
  how to pry the</span> <span m='2779620'>refrigerator door open.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2781670'>So I spent that whole year taping the refrigerator
  door</span> <span m='2784150'>shut every time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2786810'>And then, we'd play jokes on each other.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2791520'>She wouldn't eat hot dogs.</span> </p><p><span m='2793440'>And I
  wanted her to eat hot dogs desperately because</span> <span
  m='2795030'>they're cheap and easy to serve.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2797880'>All she would eat was cooked chicken wings,</span> <span
  m='2801300'>wouldn't eat hot dogs.</span> </p><p><span m='2802020'>So one day
  I said, well, I'm going to play a trick on her.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2804755'>I took a chicken bone.</span> </p><p><span m='2805950'>I stuck it
  in the middle of a hot dog and put it in a</span> <span m='2807790'>garbage
  can.</span> </p><p><span m='2808770'>And she went for it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2809800'>Her genes took over and she went for it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2811705'>And she was happy with hot dogs ever after.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2815390'>She wouldn't let me read.</span> </p><p><span m='2816790'>She
  would crawl up underneath the book and</span> <span m='2823050'>interfere and
  make me--</span> <span m='2825140'>she always wanted to suck on my thumb,
  which turned blue</span> <span m='2827480'>eventually.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2828070'>You'd be amazed at how much a raccoon can suck.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2832320'>It's just extremely powerful.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2834610'>The best parts were when she would go bike riding with me.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2838540'>I put on a heavy sweater because they have</span>
  <span m='2840040'>a pretty good grip.</span> </p><p><span m='2840900'>I'd put
  on a heavy sweater and she'd kind of mount herself on</span> <span
  m='2844710'>my back and look out over my shoulder, stopped traffic for</span>
  <span m='2847440'>miles around.</span> </p><p><span m='2851460'>So she was
  really smart.</span> </p><p><span m='2852460'>But the interesting thing is
  that at no point did I ever</span> <span m='2856960'>presume that that raccoon
  was smart enough to build a</span> <span m='2859460'>machine that was as smart
  as a raccoon.</span> </p><p><span m='2862420'>So when we think that we can, it
  involves a certain element</span> <span m='2864790'>of hubris that may or may
  not be justified.</span> </p><p><span m='2871000'>Well, there it is.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2872730'>Just a couple more things to do.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2874880'>One of which is, you should understand that Kendra and</span>
  <span m='2883005'>Kenny and Yuan and Martin and Gleb are doing a lot of
  stuff</span> <span m='2889610'>that's outside their job description.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2891846'>All of these quiz review deals that they've arranged
  are not</span> <span m='2897290'>in their job description.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2898300'>I didn't ask them to do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2899800'>That's
  all just plain old professionalism.</span> </p><p><span m='2902710'>So they've
  been wonderful to work with and</span> <span m='2904120'>I'd just like
  to--</span> <span m='2905085'>[APPLAUSE]</span> <span m='2916470'>--offer them
  a round of applause.</span> </p><p><span m='2918710'>And of course, Bob and
  Randy and Mark have done fabulous</span> <span m='2924180'>stuff as
  well.</span> </p><p><span m='2925810'>And we of the staff, the TAs, Mark, Bob,
  and Randy, have</span> <span m='2934520'>nothing else to do except wish you
  good hunting on the final</span> <span m='2941360'>and a good long winter
  solstice hibernation period</span> <span m='2945350'>after that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2947270'>And that is the end of the story.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2950420'>And we hope you live happily ever after.</span> </p><p></p>
