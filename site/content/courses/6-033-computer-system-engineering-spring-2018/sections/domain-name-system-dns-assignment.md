Read Book section 4.4: "Case Study: The Internet Domain Name System (DNS)".

As you read, think about the following:

*   What is the benefit of a recursive query?
*   What are the benefits of DNS's hierarchical design?
*   Are there any drawbacks to DNS's design?

Questions for Recitation
------------------------

**Before you come to this recitation**, write up (on paper) a _brief_ answer to the following (reallyâ€”we don't need more than a sentence or so for each question):

*   What is the purpose of DNS?
*   How does it work?
*   Why was it designed to work that way?

As always, there are multiple correct answers for each of these questions.
