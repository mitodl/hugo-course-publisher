Read "[We Did Nothing Wrong: Why Software Quality Matters](http://www.baselinemag.com/c/a/Projects-Processes/We-Did-Nothing-Wrong)" by Deborah Gage and John McCormick in _Baseline Magazine_ on March 4, 2004. This paper details a number of software systems that failed in spectacular ways, with most of the focus on a radiation machine made by Multidata called the Cobalt-60.

As you read, think about the following:

*   What fault(s) contributed to the failure of the Multidata machine?
*   Are there quality-control procedures that might have made a difference?

Question for Recitation
-----------------------

**Before you come to this recitation**, write up (on paper) a _brief_ answer to the following (reallyâ€”we don't need more than a sentence or so for each question):

*   What was the Cobalt-60?
*   How did it fail?
*   Why did it fail?

(There are multiple possible answers to each of these questions.)
