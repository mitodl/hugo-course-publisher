Recitation 15: No Recitation; Prepare for the Quiz instead
----------------------------------------------------------

Quiz 1
------

Quiz 1 will last two hours. The quiz will cover all the material up to and including Recitation 13 (CDNs). The quiz will be "open book." That means you can bring along any printed or written materials that you think might be useful. Calculators are allowed, though typically not necessary. You may also bring a laptop to view, e.g., PDF versions of papers and notes, but you may not connect to any network; make sure you download the papers to your laptop before the quiz. Charge your laptops before you come; we cannot guarantee outlet availability.

Tutorial 8: Design Project Presentation
---------------------------------------

Your presentation should reflect the feedback you got on your preliminary report; feedback on your presentation should inform your final report. Your presentation will focus on any changes you have made since the preliminary report, rather than re-capping the entire system. See the [Design Project]({{% ref "courses/6-033-computer-system-engineering-spring-2018/sections/design-project" %}}) section for more information.
