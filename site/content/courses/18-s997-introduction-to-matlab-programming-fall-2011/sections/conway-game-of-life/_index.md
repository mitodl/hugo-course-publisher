This unit challenges you to employ the skills that you have acquired in more complex tasks, as well as in a larger coding project. The project is an implementation of the Conway Game of Life, in which cells in a 2D grid are labeled as either "alive" or "dead." The game runs according to a defined set of rules, and you will be responsible for calculating each state of the cells, updating the grid, and plotting the grid. Other avenues of exploration and variations to the game are also proposed for your implementation.
