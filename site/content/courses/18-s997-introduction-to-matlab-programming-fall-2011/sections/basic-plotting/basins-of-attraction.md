Back to Newton's method: It turns out that the end result (the point to which the method converges, if any) is strongly dependent on the initial guess. Furthermore, the dependence on the first guess can be rather surprising. The set of points that converge to a given root is called the _basin of attraction_ of that root (for the iteration under discussion). I would like us to visualize the basins of attraction by coloring each starting point with a color that corresponds to the root it converges to. The different basins will thus be given different colors.

With MATLABÂ® we can easily visualize which solution is chosen as a function of the initial guess. While this can be done for 1D, we will do it for 2D and learn how to do some simple linear algebra at the same time.

Generalizing Newton's method for higher dimensions is actually quite straightforward: Instead of one function \\(f\\), we have many, written as a vector \\(\\vec f\\), and instead of one independent variable (\\(x\\)) we have many, again, written as a vector, \\(\\vec x\\). Thus we are looking for the vector \\(x\\) for which:

\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:4} \\vec f(\\vec x)=\\vec 0 \\end{equation}

The update rule is slightly different since derivatives are more complicated in higher dimensions:

\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:newtons:multi:d} \\vec x\_{n+1}=\\vec x\_n- (J\\vec f)^{-1} \\vec f(\\vec x\_n). \\end{equation}

Here \\(Jf\\) is the _Jacobian matrix_ of \\(\\vec f\\), that is a matrix whose term in the \\(i-\\)th row and \\(j-\\)th column is

\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:5} (J\\vec f)\_{ij}=\\frac{\\partial f\_i}{\\partial x\_j}. \\end{equation}

Notice that the Jacobian depends on \\(\\vec x\\) and thus needs to be re-evaluated at every step (just like the derivative in one-dimensional Newton's method). The two parts in the right-most term of (2) are multiplied together in the linear algebra sense of the word. The power \\(-1\\) is matrix inverse (and not multiplicative inverse) and thus another way of writing the update rule is

\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:6} (J\\vec f) \\delta\\vec x\_n= (J\\vec f) (\\vec x\_{n+1}-\\vec x\_n)=-\\vec f(\\vec x\_n). \\end{equation}

This formulation is a much better way of understanding Newton's method, as it exposes what is going on: The approximation is updated so that if the linear approximation to \\(\\vec f\\) (given by the Jacobian matrix) were exact, the approximation would equal the exact root in one step.

How to implement? First we need a specific function: \\(\\vec f(\[x,y\]^t)=\[x^3-y,y^3-x\]^t\\) and thus the Jacobian matrix is \\((\\begin{smallmatrix} 3x^2 & -1 \\\\ -1& 3y^2 \\end{smallmatrix})\\). In MATLAB we want to have one variable, say \\(X\\), be a column vector that holds both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). The code for a simple Newton method for \\(f\\) would be:

```
X=[1;2];   % the starting point. Notice the use of semicolon to define a column vector
for j=1:10 
```

**Exercise 11.** _Multi-dimensional Newton's method_

*   _What are the 3 roots of \\(\\vec f\\) in the code above? (think of them as_ `r1`, `r2`, `r3`.)
*   _Implement the program above and play around with the starting point to get several different answers. If you get a warning about singular matrices, don't worry about it._
*   _Find the Jacobian matrix,_ \\(J\\vec g\\), of:
    
    \\begin{equation\*} \\vec g(\\vec x)= \\begin{pmatrix} \\sin(x\_1+2x\_2^2)-x\_2\\\\ x\_1^2x\_2-x\_1 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{equation\*}
    
*   _The function \\(g\\) has many roots; modify the Newton solver to find some them by manually starting at different places._
*   _Are you iterating enough times? Check that the results you get are a good enough root, and if they are not, change the number of iterations so that they are._

Now here's the run-up to the next project: We want to plot the "basin of attraction" of each of the three zeros (what are they?) of the function \\(\\vec f\\) (not \\(\\vec g\\)). This will be your first project, but first we need to discuss how to plot the result. For an initial point \\(X\_0\\) we can run the Newton code and after several iterations (10 in the example above) it will arrive _near_ (in most cases) one of three roots, say \\(r\_1, r\_2, r\_3\\). To visualize the basin of attraction, we go over a grid of points \\(X\_0\\) and color them according to the to the specific zero the Newton's method algorithm ends up being close to after starting from \\(X\_0\\). If the algorithm is not close to any of them, we put a fourth color. While it is true that normally we do not know what the zeros are, but this is also interesting in the case that we do know what they are, so we are using the _a priori_ information about the location of the roots in order to visualize the basin of attraction.

To do this we need `if-else-end` statements:

```
if norm(X-r1)<1e-8 % if the distance between X and r1 is less than 10^-8
     c='r';        % use the color red
elseif norm(X-r2)<1e-8
     c='b';        % use the color blue
elseif norm(X-r3)<1e-8
     c='g';        % use the color green
else               % if not close to any of the roots
     c='k';        % use the color black
end
plot(x,y,'.','color',c); % plot a point at X_0, (not the final point X!)
                         % with the color c
```

**Project 1.** _Place the Newton code, and the_ `if-then-else` _code above inside two nested_ `for` _loops, looping over_ \\(x-\\) _values and_ \\(y-\\) _values from -2 to 2 (perhaps with a small step-size of 0.1 or 0.01). For each iteration set the starting point to_ `[x,y]'` _before the Newton's Method part, and then plot the color point corresponding to the location of the resulting zero. So that the subsequent plot commands do not erase the previous ones, put:_

```
clf % clear the current Figure
hold on % make sure subsequent plots do not erase the previous ones.
```

_before the_ `for` _loops. Thus the pseudo-code for this construction is:_

```
initialize figure
for x values
     for y values
          let X0=(x,y) be the starting point for Newton's method
          find the color corresponding to the final point of iteration X
          plot point X0 with correct color
     end loop y
end loop x
```

If this is your first programming project, you might get frustrated at how difficult it seems to get everything in place. There's no way around it. Read you own code carefully. Give good names to your variables. Try to explain the code to someone else.

That said, there are several hints I can give:

| Hint 1. | If MATLAB is stuck, use Ctrl C to abort from a long calculation or to reset the command line. |
| Hint 2. | If MATLAB is spewing out too much onto the screen and you cannot see what you want to see, add semi-colons (`;`) to the end of the "offending" lines to prevent MATLAB from doing that. |
| Hint 3. | If all the points seem to be plotted at the roots rather than at the original points, you are probably using \\(X\\) to do the plotting rather than the original point (x,y) from the loop. |
| Hint 4. | If you are getting warnings from MATLAB that your "Matrix is close to singular or badly scaled" don't worry about it too much. It means that your algorithm has passed through a point where the Jacobian matrix is singular. The result from that point is unreliable, but there should be (relatively) few of these points, and so the overall picture will be preserved. |
| Hint 5. | If you always only have one point on your plot, you are probably not `hold`ing the plot properly. The two lines of code under the description of the project should be before the `for` loops (and not anywhere else). |
| Hint 6. | What is the solution supposed to look like? My result can be seen in Fig. 1. Increasing the number of iterations should make the black regions (places that have not converged) smaller.
