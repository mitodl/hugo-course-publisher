Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This course provides an introduction to cellular and population-level systems biology with an emphasis on synthetic biology, modeling of genetic networks, cell-cell interactions, and evolutionary dynamics. Cellular systems include genetic switches and oscillators, network motifs, genetic network evolution, and cellular decision-making. Population-level systems include models of pattern formation, cell-cell communication, and evolutionary systems biology.

Prerequisites
-------------

Given the wide range of backgrounds among students in this class we will try to avoid unnecessary jargon and mathematics. However, it will be very helpful if you are comfortable with the material in [_Introductory Biology 7.012_](./resolveuid/33817d1d1e0e0ec7a8a4bfbb92e959d3), [_Differential Equations 18.03_](./resolveuid/3caf857bc5c2495393d761d529a6b62b), and [_Probability 18.05_](./resolveuid/e5609df443ee617eddfe45413f3d7c5a). In addition, each weekly problem set will have a computational problem, so prior experience with a computational package such as MATLAB®, Mathematica®, or Python is expected. The "officially supported" package will be Python (sample code, etc), but problems can be done in any language.

Pre-class Reading Questions
---------------------------

To facilitate interactions during class between students, we will have short required questions about the reading that will be due before class.

Grading
-------

The course will have weekly problem sets (due at the end of each week), two midterms, and a final. The grading breakdown is as follows:

| Problem sets | 40% |
| Pre-class reading questions | 5% |
| Midterm 1 | 15% |
| Midterm 2 | 15% |
| Final Exam | 25%
