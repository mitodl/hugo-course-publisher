course_description: >-
  <p>This course provides an introduction to cellular and population-level
  systems biology with an emphasis on synthetic biology, modeling of genetic
  networks, cell-cell interactions, and evolutionary dynamics. Cellular systems
  include genetic switches and oscillators, network motifs, genetic network
  evolution, and cellular decision-making. Population-level systems include
  models of pattern formation, cell-cell communication, and evolutionary systems
  biology.</p>
