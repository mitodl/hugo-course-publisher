  <p>A neutrophil (a type of white blood cell, shown in blue-gray) interacting
  with <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em> bacteria (shown in pink). This is one
  example of the types of functions that Systems Biology seeks to understand and
  describe. Watch <a

This course provides an introduction to cellular and population-level systems biology with an emphasis on synthetic biology, modeling of genetic networks, cell-cell interactions, and evolutionary dynamics. Cellular systems include genetic switches and oscillators, network motifs, genetic network evolution, and cellular decision-making. Population-level systems include models of pattern formation, cell-cell communication, and evolutionary systems biology.
