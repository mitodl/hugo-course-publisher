  <p>Together, this course and its predecessor, <a
  href="./resolveuid/4cc828ff9c6e246aa4a08f7c12251ced">8.05: Quantum Physics
  II</a>, cover quantum physics with applications drawn from modern physics.
  Topics in this course include units, time-independent approximation methods,
  the structure of one- and two-electron atoms, charged particles in a magnetic
  field, scattering, and time-dependent perturbation theory. In this second
  term, students are required to research and write a paper on a topic related
  to the content of 8.05 and 8.06.</p>
