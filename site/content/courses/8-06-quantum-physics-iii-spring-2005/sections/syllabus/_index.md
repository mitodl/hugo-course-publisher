Prerequisites
-------------

You must complete Quantum Mechanics II ([8.05](./resolveuid/4cc828ff9c6e246aa4a08f7c12251ced)) with a grade of C or better before attempting 8.06.

Grading
-------

Grades will be determined by a weighted average of problem sets, a Midterm that will be held in class, a Term Paper, and a Final Exam. The faculty may alter grades to reflect class participation, improvement, effort and other qualitative measures of performance.

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Problem Sets | 30% |
| Midterm Exam | 15% |
| Term Paper | 20% |
| Final Exam | 35% 

Problem Sets
------------

Problem sets are a very important part of 8.06. We believe that sitting down yourself and trying to reason your way through a problem not only helps you learn the material deeply, but also develops analytical tools fundamental to a successful career in science. We recognize that students also learn a great deal from talking to and working with each other. We therefore encourage each 8.06 student to make his/her own attempt on every problem and then, having done so, to discuss the problems with one another and collaborate on understanding them more fully. The solutions you submit must reflect your own work. They must not be transcriptions or reproductions of other people's work. Plagiarism is a serious offense and is easy to recognize. Don't submit work which is not your own.

Term Paper
----------

Everyone in 8.06 will be expected to research, write and "publish" a short paper on a topic related to the content of 8.05 or 8.06. The paper can explain a physical effect or further explicate ideas or problems covered in the courses. It can be based on the student's own calculations and/or library research. The paper should be written in the style and format of a brief journal article and should aim at an audience of 8.06 students. Writing, editing, revising and "publishing" skills are an integral part of the project, which is described in full in the [projects]({{% getpage "courses/8-06-quantum-physics-iii-spring-2005/sections/projects/_index.md" %}}) section.

Because 8.06 is a CI-M ([Communication Intensive in the Major](http://web.mit.edu/commreq/background.html)) Subject, in order to pass 8.06 you must obtain a grade of C or better on your term paper. If you do not succeed in this, you will get a grade of Incomplete until you revise your term paper sufficiently to earn at least a C, and only at that time you will be assigned a final grade based on the breakdown given above.
