Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[_21M.301 Harmony and Counterpoint I_](./resolveuid/4a16a746d8d94c67b1cd15a83a556ab8) or permission of instructor. Basic score-reading ability is recommended.

General Information
-------------------

In _21M.250_ we will study the style, form, musical language, and context of selected works composed from the late eighteenth century (the time of Beethoven) through the late nineteenth century (Mahler). Listening, specifically analytical listening is vital to this course. Initially, you should listen to each assignment before and after the class meeting. Then listen again (and again), in order to familiarize yourself with each piece.

The primary text for this class is:

Oxford University Press, 2011. ISBN: 9780199842162. Assigned readings will be taken from this text.

_Concert Reports:_ You will attend three concerts this semester featuring music from the late eighteenth through the late nineteenth centuries and write 2–4 page reports on each experience.

_Listening Guides:_ Each student will prepare several listening guides which will be shared with the class and used to lead that day's discussion of the assigned listening.

Exams

There will be two exams. Each exam will cover the assigned listening and reading, as well as material discussed in class. Questions will feature excerpts from the assigned listening for identification, description, and comparison.
