course_description: >-
  <p>This course covers matrix theory and linear algebra, emphasizing topics
  useful in other disciplines such as physics, economics and social sciences,
  natural sciences, and engineering. It parallels the combination of theory and
  applications in Professor Strang&rsquo;s textbook <a
