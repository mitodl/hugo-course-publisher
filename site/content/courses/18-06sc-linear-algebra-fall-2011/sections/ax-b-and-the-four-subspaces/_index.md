The big picture of linear algebra: Four Fundamental Subspaces.

Mathematics is a tool for describing the world around us. Linear equations give some of the simplest descriptions, and systems of linear equations are made by combining several descriptions.

In this unit we write systems of linear equations in the matrix form _A_x = b. We explore how the properties of _A_ and b determine the solutions x (if any exist) and pay particular attention to the solutions to _A_x = 0. For a given matrix _A_ we ask which b can be written in the form _A_x.
