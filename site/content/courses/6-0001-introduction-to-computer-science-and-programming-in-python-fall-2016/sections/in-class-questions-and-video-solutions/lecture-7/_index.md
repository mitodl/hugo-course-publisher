1.  ### Black Box and Glass Box Testing
    
      
    
    With the below implementation, is the test set "n = 4 | n = -4 | n = 5" path complete?
    
        def is_even(n):
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp;Yes&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp;No&nbsp;

Exercise 2

&nbsp;n is very large (and positive)&nbsp;

&nbsp; n is very small (and negative)&nbsp;

&nbsp;n is 0&nbsp;
