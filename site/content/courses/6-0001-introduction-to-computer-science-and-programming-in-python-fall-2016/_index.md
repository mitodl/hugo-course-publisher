  <p><em>6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python</em>
  is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to
  provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in
  solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel
  justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them
  to accomplish useful goals. The class uses the Python 3.5 programming
  language.</p>
