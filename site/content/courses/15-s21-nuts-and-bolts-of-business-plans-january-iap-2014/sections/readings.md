| 2 | <br><br>Part 1: Marketing and Sales<br><br>### Speaker<br><br>Bob Jones<br><br> | <br><br>Many entrepreneurs, especially technology based entrepreneurs, are accused of being too in love with their technology or concept. They rationalize that if they develop a better mousetrap then the product will sell itself. However, a good technology or product idea is a necessary but not a sufficient condition to establishing and growing a successful business venture. Who will buy the product? How will you reach buyers? How much will they pay?<br><br>If you have an idea for a product or service, how do you determine whether there is a market for it? How do you develop a marketing strategy? How do you turn your idea and market research into sales? What do you need to do to convince potential investors that there is a market and that your idea is viable? If you don't have a specific product or service idea but you see a potential need, how do you turn the need into a product or service?<br><br>This session will discuss these issues and provide guidance on how to approach the marketing section of your business plan.<br><br> | <br><br>[![Buy at Amazon](/images/a_logo_17.gif)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B001VV27VC/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20) Moore, Geoffrey A.
