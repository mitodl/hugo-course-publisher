course_description: >-
  <p>The nuts and bolts of preparing a New Venture Plan and launching the
  venture will be explored in this twenty-fifth&nbsp;annual course offering. The
  course is open to members of the MIT Community and to others interested in
  entrepreneurship. It is particularly recommended for persons who are
  interested in starting or are involved in a new business or venture. Because
  some of the speakers will be judges of the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship
  Competition, persons who are planning to enter the Competition should find the
  course particularly useful. In the past approximately 50% of the class has
  been from the Engineering / Science / Architecture Schools and 50% from the
  Sloan School of Management.</p><p>The course is offered during the Independent
  Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from
  the first week of January until the end of the month.</p>
