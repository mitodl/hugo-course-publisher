The purpose is to gain insights into their operations to enable government partnering agencies to better interface and protect taxpayer dollars in various public-private partnerships that can form to extend credit to borrowers.

*   Adverse selection, lack of transparency, regulatory capture, conflicts of interest

*   How they game the system
*   Metrics for detecting the games

Predicting Credit Risk at For-Profit Lending Partners
-----------------------------------------------------

*   Who are they?
*   What are they doing? Trend line analysis
*   What are they thinking? The key driver and key strategy
*   A successful agency solution: SBA’s PARRIS

Predicting Credit Risk at Non-Profit Partners
---------------------------------------------

*   The key differences
*   A successful agency solution: the NeighborWorks PROMPT

Remediation
-----------

*   Protecting the program from excessive risk and misuse
*   Segmentation by performance in key metrics
*   Graduated remedies

Interactive
-----------

1.  Based on metrics of three different small business lenders going into 2007, which of them will have the worst performing loans and which will survive—two different outcomes?
