Video: Wealth Inequality in America
-----------------------------------

{{< youtube QPKKQnijnsM >}}

The above video, "Wealth Inequality in America," highlights the CEO-to-average-worker compensation ratio. You may have seen different ratios reported in the news or elsewhere.  The ratio cited in this video is from the AFL-CIO's [Executive Paywatch](http://www.aflcio.org/Corporate-Watch/Paywatch-2014) website.

An example of a slightly different estimate of compensation ratio, from the Economic Policy Institute, can be found in the next video below.
