Attentiveness Question
----------------------

Which of the following is not a key lesson from the Market Basket case?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Producers of low-cost goods and services need to rely on lean staffing in order to keep profits up.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Even in a low cost setting it is not only possible but also profitable to create a business model that creates value for customers, employees, and investors at the same time.&nbsp;

Explanation

The Market Basket case shows that by having higher staffing levels than other low-cost supermarkets, workers can complete their jobs without errors while also spending more time addressing customer needs.
