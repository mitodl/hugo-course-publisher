  <p>Demonstration of the effects of sampling and aliasing for sinusoidal
  frequencies. Beginning at half the sampling frequency, the output sinusoidal
  frequency will decrease despite an increasing input frequency. These topics
  are covered in lecture 14 and the demonstration videos.</p>
course_description: >-
  <p>This course was developed in 1987 by the MIT Center for Advanced
  Engineering Studies. It was designed as a distance-education course for
  engineers and scientists in the workplace.</p> <p>Advances in integrated
  circuit technology have had a major impact on the technical areas to which
  digital signal processing techniques and hardware are being applied. A
  thorough understanding of digital signal processing fundamentals and
  techniques is essential for anyone whose work is concerned with signal
  processing applications.</p> <p>Digital Signal Processing begins with a
  discussion of the analysis and representation of discrete-time signal systems,
  including discrete-time convolution, difference equations, the z-transform,
  and the discrete-time Fourier transform. Emphasis is placed on the
  similarities and distinctions between discrete-time. The course proceeds to
  cover digital network and nonrecursive (finite impulse response) digital
  filters. Digital Signal Processing concludes with digital filter design and a
  discussion of the fast Fourier transform algorithm for computation of the
  discrete Fourier transform.</p>
