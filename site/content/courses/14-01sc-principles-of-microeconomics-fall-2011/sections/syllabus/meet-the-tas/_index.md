I am Jessica Leight and I'm a Ph.D. student in Economics at MIT. I was a teaching assistant for _14.01 Principles of Microeconomics_ in both semesters in the 2010-2011 year, and also served as the head TA. Introductory economics is an engaging subject and one that can serve as a foundation for a long academic career in economics or related fields, as it has for me. My primary research interests are in development and health economics, and prior to coming to MIT, I studied at Yale and Oxford. Economics is an extremely rewarding subject to study, and I hope you find this - your first introduction to it - exciting!

I'm Nora Hagerman and I'm a junior at Wellesley College, studying Economics. Ever since I took my first Econ class on a whim freshman year, I have been fascinated with studying how people make the decisions that shape our country's economy. While I have focused on Macroeconomics and the global economy in school, I have really enjoyed reviewing Microeconomics while working with MIT OpenCourseWare!
