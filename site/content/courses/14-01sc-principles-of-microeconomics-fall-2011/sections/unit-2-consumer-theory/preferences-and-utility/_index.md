Session Overview
----------------

| ![lec04.jpg](/courses/economics/14-01sc-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2011/unit-2-consumer-theory/preferences-and-utility/lec04.jpg) | {{< br >}}{{< br >}}Behind every supply and demand curve is an army of producers and consumers making their own decisions. For consumers, their decisions are driven, quite simply, by what they want! All consumers make decisions to maximize their utility. In this lecture, we will learn about utility, how to define it and how we represent it mathematically.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_How does each slice of pizza you consume impact your utility for the next?

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

$( function($){ var quizMulti = { multiList: \[ { ques: "Which of the following is NOT an assumption that we make about consumer preferences?", ans: "Downward-sloping.", ansSel: \["Non-satiation.", "Completeness.", "Transitivity."\], ansInfo: "This is a property of indifference curves (they are downward-sloping), not of the underlying preferences. Non-satiation, completeness and transitivity are the key assumptions made about consumer preferences." }, { ques: "Why can't indifference curves be upward-sloping?", ans: "It's a violation of the non-satiation principle.", ansSel: \["It's a violation of the completeness principle.", "It makes it impossible to calculate marginal utility.", "All of these."\], ansInfo: "If an indifference curve is upward-sloping, it implies you are indifferent between a combination with a smaller amount of both good x and good y, and a combination with a larger amount of both good x and good y. The non-satiation principle tells us more is always better, and so the bundle with a larger amount of both good x and good y must be preferred." }, { ques: "How is marginal utility defined?", ans: "The derivative of utility with respect to the number of goods consumed.", ansSel: \["The total utility gained from consuming a bundle of goods.", "The utility gained from consuming the first unit of a given good.", "The utility gained from consuming only one good."\], ansInfo: "Marginal utility captures how your utility changes when you consume more of a good." }, { ques: "How does the marginal rate of substitution change as you move along a non-linear indifference curve?", ans: "It declines.", ansSel: \["It stays the same.", "It increases.", "It depends on the specific shape of the indifference curve."\], ansInfo: "A non-linear indifference curve is concave to the origin, and the marginal state of substitution is declining as you move along the indifference curve to the right. Assume pizza is on the y-axis and movies are on the x-axis. As you move to the right, you have more and more movies, and the marginal utility from each additional movie decreases. Accordingly, the marginal rate of substitution (the rate at which you are willing to trade movies for pizza) declines&mdash;you have too many movies, so you'd be happy to give some up for pizza, even if you don't get much pizza in exchange! (Note there is one exception to this rule; if you have a linear indifference curve, the marginal rate of substitution is constant. For this reason, the question specified non-linear indifference curves.)" }, { ques: "What is an appropriate intuitive explanation of the principle of diminishing marginal utility?", ans: "All of these.", ansSel: \["Consumers have a preference for diversity in consumption.", "Consumers value more the first unit of any good they own, compared to the hundredth unit.", "Everyone gets tired of consuming the same thing eventually."\], ansInfo: "These are all appropriate ways to capture the intuition behind the principle of diminishing marginal utility." }\] }; var options = { allRandom: false, Random: false, help: "", showHTML: false, animationType: 0, showWrongAns: true, title: "Concept test 1", }; $("#quizArea").jQuizMe(quizMulti, options); });
