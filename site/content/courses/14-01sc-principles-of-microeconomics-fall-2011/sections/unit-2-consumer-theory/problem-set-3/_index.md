Preparation
-----------

The problem set is comprised of challenging questions that test your understanding of the material covered in the course. Make sure you have mastered the concepts and problem solving techniques from the following sessions before attempting the problem set:

*   [Deriving Demand Curves]({{% getpage "courses/14-01sc-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2011/sections/unit-2-consumer-theory/deriving-demand-curves/_index.md" %}})
*   [Applying Consumer Theory: Labor]({{% getpage "courses/14-01sc-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2011/sections/unit-2-consumer-theory/applying-consumer-theory-labor/_index.md" %}})

Problem Set and Solutions
-------------------------

*   [Problem Set Questions (PDF)]({{% getpage "courses/14-01sc-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2011/sections/unit-2-consumer-theory/problem-set-3/MIT14_01SCF11_assn03" %}})
*   [Problem Set Solutions (PDF)]({{% getpage "courses/14-01sc-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2011/sections/unit-2-consumer-theory/problem-set-3/MIT14_01SCF11_soln03" %}})

Problem Solving Video
---------------------

In the video below, a teaching assistant demonstrates his approach to the solution for problem 5 from the problem set. The teaching assistant notes common mistakes made by students and provides problem solving techniques for approaching similar questions on the problem set and exams.
