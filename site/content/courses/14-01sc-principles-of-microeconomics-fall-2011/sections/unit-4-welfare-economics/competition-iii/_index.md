While we assume that firms maximize profits, this may not always be true, and in this lecture we start to learn why. We also start to think about how we can measure the welfare that consumers gain from participating in a market.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_Stocks and stock options are commonly used to overcome the agency problem.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

$( function($){ var quizMulti = { multiList: \[ { ques: "Which of the following is NOT an example of the agency problem?", ans: "A company hires workers to expand its business, but then finds it doesn't have enough equipment for them to work on.", ansSel: \["Shareholders find it challenging to control a chief executive officer, who may seek to increase his own pay rather than increase the value of the company.", "The owner of a pizza parlor hires an employee to manage the business while he is away, but he can't monitor whether the employee actually sells pizza or just wastes time."\], ansInfo: "The other two options are both examples of the agency problem. When it is hard to observe managers' actions, and their pay is not fully tied to performance, they may not maximize profits. However, when a company hires workers to expand its business but lacks equipment for them to work on, the resulting issue is not relevant to the agency problem. Rather, it is an example of suboptimal balance between labor and capital." }, { ques: "What is a strategy that can be used to align the incentives of managers and owners in a given company?", ans: "Provide the managers with both stock and stock options in the company.", ansSel: \["Pay the managers more.", "Provide the managers with stock in the company.", "Provide the managers with stock options for the company."\], ansInfo: "Providing the managers with stocks or stock options gives them an incentive to raise shareholder value, because they will also benefit from higher value. Raising their salary, on the other hand, does not change their incentives." }, { ques: "What is the definition of consumer surplus?", ans: "The area below the demand curve above the price line.", ansSel: \["The area above the supply curve below the price line.", "The area under the demand curve.", "The sum of the area above the supply curve below the price line and the area below the demand curve above the price line."\], ansInfo: "The area above the supply curve below the price line is producer surplus, and the sum of the area above the supply curve below the price line and the area below the demand curve above the price line is total surplus." }, { ques: "Assume a consumer bought two concert tickets, and valued the first ticket at $50 and the second ticket at $30. The price of both tickets was $30. What is the consumer surplus for this consumer in the transaction?", ans: "$20.", ansSel: \["$60.", "$80.", "$30."\], ansInfo: "The consumer gained no consumer surplus on the last ticket, since the price was equal to his valuation of the ticket. However, the surplus on the first ticket purchased was $20." }\] }; var options = { allRandom: false, Random: false, help: "", showHTML: false, animationType: 0, showWrongAns: true, title: "Concept test 1", }; $("#quizArea").jQuizMe(quizMulti, options); });
