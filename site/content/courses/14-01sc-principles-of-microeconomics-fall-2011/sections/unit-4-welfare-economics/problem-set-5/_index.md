Preparation
-----------

The problem set is comprised of challenging questions that test your understanding of the material covered in the course. Make sure you have mastered the concepts and problem solving techniques from the following sessions before attempting the problem set:

*   [Competition II]({{% getpage "courses/14-01sc-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2011/sections/unit-3-producer-theory/competition-ii/_index.md" %}})
*   [Competition III]({{% getpage "courses/14-01sc-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2011/sections/unit-4-welfare-economics/competition-iii/_index.md" %}})
