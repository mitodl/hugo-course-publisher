In fact, the majority of government revenue earned is devoted to social insurance. Social insurance is designed to insure individuals against risk in cases where the private market may not effectively provide such insurance. In this lecture, we will begin to learn about the role of social insurance.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_Social Security, launched in 1935, is a US social insurance program.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

$( function($){ var quizMulti = { multiList: \[ { ques: "What is one potential disadvantage of social insurance programs such as Social Security?", ans: "It encourages people to retire earlier.", ansSel: \["It is subject to adverse selection.", "It is regressive.", "It insures people from unexpected loss of earning power."\], ansInfo: "The correct answer is that social insurance programs such as Social Security may encourage people to retire earlier than they would have otherwise, and thus removes productive people from the workforce. Social Security is not subject to adverse selection, because it has universal enrollment (and so it is not possible that only those at high risk of disability or early retirement enroll). It is not regressive (in fact, it is progressive). It does insure people from unexpected loss of earning power, but this is the objective of the policy, not a disadvantage." }, { ques: "Which of the following behaviors is an example of moral hazard?", ans: "All of these.", ansSel: \["After you buy fire insurance, you are less careful about fire prevention.", "Once you have health insurance, you do not take preventive health measures.", "Once you are receiving unemployment, you feel less pressure to search for a job."\], ansInfo: "Moral hazard refers to the phenomenon in which insuring an agent against an adverse event (sickness, car accidents, fires, unemployment) then encourages adverse (i.e., reckless) behavior that may make those events more likely. This can occur in any insurance market." }, { ques: "Which of the following behaviors is an example of adverse selection?", ans: "People with chronic illnesses are most likely to buy health insurance.", ansSel: \["After purchasing insurance, people sometimes become less cautious.", "Younger drivers generally have a greater risk of accidents.", "Younger drivers generally pay higher premiums for auto insurance."\], ansInfo: "The correct answer is that people with chronic illnesses are more likely to buy health insurance, because their expected benefit from the health insurance is greatest. Becoming less cautious after purchasing insurance is an example of moral hazard. On the other hand, the fact that younger drivers generally have a greater risk of accidents and thus pay higher premiums is not an example of either moral hazard or adverse selection, but reflects the fact that insurance costs typically correspond to relative risk." }\] }; var options = { allRandom: false, Random: false, help: "", showHTML: false, animationType: 0, showWrongAns: true, title: "Concept test 1", }; $("#quizArea").jQuizMe(quizMulti, options); });
