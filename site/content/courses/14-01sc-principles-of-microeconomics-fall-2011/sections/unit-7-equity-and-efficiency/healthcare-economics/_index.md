$( function($){ var quizMulti = { multiList: \[ { ques: "Which of the following is NOT a feature of the PPACA?", ans: "Government provision of universal healthcare.", ansSel: \["Individual mandates.", "No discrimination in health insurance.", "Subsidies for low income individuals."\], ansInfo: "The PPACA requires all individuals to be covered by a healthcare insurance policy to fix the adverse selection problem and allow insurance companies to price insurance fairly. In turns, it forbids insurance companies from discriminating in health insurance costs. Furthermore, to guarantee that everyone can afford insurance, it provides subsidies for low income individuals." }, { ques: "Which of the following is an example of the moral hazard resulting from health insurance coverage?", ans: "Both resource overutilization and decrease in individual precaution.", ansSel: \["Resource overutilization.", "Decrease in individual precaution.", "Provision of subsidies."\], ansInfo: "Individuals covered by health insurance are more likely to engage in risky behaviors since they dont bear the financial cost of injury. Furthermore, individuals are more likely to use medical services, and healthcare providers are more likely to provide more medical care than necessary." }\] }; var options = { allRandom: false, Random: false, help: "", showHTML: false, animationType: 0, showWrongAns: true, title: "Concept test 1", }; $("#quizArea").jQuizMe(quizMulti, options); });
