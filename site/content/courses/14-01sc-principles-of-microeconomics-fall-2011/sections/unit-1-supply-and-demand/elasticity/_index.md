When the price of a good changes, consumers' demand for that good changes. We can understand these changes by graphing supply and demand curves and analyzing their properties.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_Toilet paper is an example of an elastic good.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

$( function($){ var quizMulti = { multiList: \[ { ques: "Which of the following accurately characterize perfectly inelastic demand?", ans: "The demand curve is vertical but does not change regardless of what happens to price.", ansSel: \["The demand curve is vertical.", "The demand curve is horizontal.", "Demand does not change regardless of what happens to price."\], ansInfo: "A vertical demand curve means that if the supply curve shifts, only the price changes; there is no change in quantity demanded." }, { ques: "When do we expect to see a perfectly elastic demand curve?", ans: "When a good has a perfect substitute.", ansSel: \["When a good has no substitutes.", "When a good has many complements.", "When there is limited supply of a good."\], ansInfo: "When a good has a perfect substitute (for example, hamburgers at different fast food chains), then if there is a price increase at one store, consumers will simply switch to purchasing from another store. This results in a perfectly elastic demand curve. A good that has no substitutes will have perfectly inelastic demand. The existence of complementary goods and the nature of the supply curve do not affect the elasticity of demand." }, { ques: "Lets say a researcher makes a study of patients in hospitals and finds they are much sicker than the average person in the population. Then he concludes that hospitals make patients sick. The researcher is mixing up two concepts; what are they?", ans: "Correlation and causation.", ansSel: \["Theory and empirics.", "Demand and supply.", "Shifts along the demand curve and shifts in the demand curve."\], ansInfo: "Being in the hospital is correlated with being ill, because primarily ill patients are admitted to the hospital, but this is not the cause of the illness. The primary challenge of empirical economics is to distinguish correlation and causation." }, { ques: "If the elasticity of demand for a good is sufficiently negative, firms may actually lose revenues when they raise the price of the good. Why is this?", ans: "Fewer people buy the good at the higher price, and so overall revenues are lower.", ansSel: \["The elasticity of demand changes.", "The supply curve shifts in.", "Consumers substitute from other goods to buy this firms good."\], ansInfo: "The elasticity of demand does not change when price changes, and we have not discussed any change on the supply side. If revenue is declining that means that consumers are shifting away from this firms good (now that is newly expensive) and purchasing goods made by other firms, not vice versa." }, { ques: "What is an example of a supply shock in the orange market that would enable us to estimate demand elasticity?", ans: "All of these.", ansSel: \["A new government tax on orange growers.", "An early frost in Florida that destroys crops.", "A plant disease that hits orange crops."\], ansInfo: "Any shock to the supply of a good caused by weather or government policy will shift the supply curve, and this will allow us to use the resulting changes in price and quantity sold to estimate the elasticity of demand." }\] }; var options = { allRandom: false, Random: false, help: "", showHTML: false, animationType: 0, showWrongAns: true, title: "Concept test 1", }; $("#quizArea").jQuizMe(quizMulti, options); });
