Session Overview

You can use the tools of microeconomics to decide how best to spend your income; how best to divide your time among leisure activities; or how many people to hire in the business you run. Life is full of choices. Microeconomics can help you decide how to make them.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_Economics can't help you make a selection from this box of chocolates, but can be a vital tool in other decision-making situations.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

$( function($){ var quizMulti = { multiList: \[ { ques: "Which of the following is an accurate description of the primary theme of microeconomics?", ans: "All of these.", ansSel: \["A set of constrained optimization problems.", "Studying how individuals and firms make themselves as well off as possible given conditions of scarcity.", "Analyzing tradeoffs."\], ansInfo: "All three of these answers encapsulate the main theme of microeconomics in a different way: constrained optimization problems allow us to analyze how individuals and firms can make themselves as well off as possible given scarcity. This entails analyzing the trade-offs between investing in different activities." }, { ques: "What is a model?", ans: "Any description of the relationship between two or more economic variables.", ansSel: \["A full description of a particular economic phenomenon.", "A description of an economic phenomenon that makes no extra assumptions.", "An empirical study that analyzes how a certain part of the economy works."\], ansInfo: "Models do not provide a complete description of a particular economic phenomenon; instead, they make simplifying assumptions that render the model more tractable to work with. While empirical studies may make use of models, they are not identical." }, { ques: "What is the key assumption in microeconomics?", ans: "Individuals maximize utility and firms maximize profits.", ansSel: \["Individuals maximize their income.", "Firms maximize profits.", "Firms maximize sales."\], ansInfo: "Though it is accurate to say that firms maximize profits, it is incomplete. Individuals dont solely maximize income, rather utility, and sales and profits for a firm are not identical." }, { ques: "What is the distinction between empirical and theoretical economics?", ans: "Theoretical economics builds models, and empirical economics test them.", ansSel: \["Theoretical economics analyzes individuals and empirical economics analyzes firms.", "Theoretical economics analyzes long-term phenomena and empirical economics analyzes short-term.", "Theoretical economics tests models, and empirical economics builds them."\], ansInfo: "Both theoretical and empirical economics can analyze either individuals or firms, and either short-term or long-term phenomena." }, { ques: "Which of the following statements represents normative, rather than positive analysis?", ans: "People should not be allowed to purchase bodily organs, because it allows the rich access to a life-saving procedure that the poor may not have access to.", ansSel: \["Since the supply of gems is limited, their price is very high.", "Since the supply of water is very large, the price of water is very low.", "The demand for organ transplants currently far exceeds the supply."\], ansInfo: "This is a normative statement that is based on an assumption of equity (we want rich and poor to have equal access to treatment.) The others answers are positive statements that are based on facts about the supply and demand of goods in different markets." }\] }; var options = { allRandom: false, Random: false, help: "", showHTML: false, animationType: 0, showWrongAns: true, title: "Concept test 1", }; $("#quizArea").jQuizMe(quizMulti, options); });
