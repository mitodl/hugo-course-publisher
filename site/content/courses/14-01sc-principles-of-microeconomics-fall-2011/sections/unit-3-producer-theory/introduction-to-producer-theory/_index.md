Goods are produced by firms, and analyzing the decisions of firms is also central to our understanding of the economy. In this lecture, we will learn how companies make important operation decisions.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_When considering firm production decisions, we must consider the two forms of firm input – labor and capital.

_Keywords_: Production theory; firm production functions; variable inputs; fixed inputs; short run production; long run production; marginal rate of technical substitution; returns to scale.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

$( function($){ var quizMulti = { multiList: \[ { ques: "What is the primary objective of firms?", ans: "Maximizing profit.", ansSel: \["Minimizing costs.", "Maximizing revenue.", "Maximizing utility."\], ansInfo: "Costs and revenue are relevant to the firm's decision, but their primary objective is maximizing profit. Utility is maximized by consumers, not firms." }, { ques: "What is the difference between the short-run and the long-run from the perspective of production theory?", ans: "In the short run, only labor varies, and in the long run both labor and capital vary.", ansSel: \["In the short run, all inputs are variable, and in the long run they are invariable.", "In the short run, all inputs are invariable, and in the long run they are variable.", "In the short run, only capital varies, and in the long run both labor and capital vary."\], ansInfo: "In the short run, it is easy for a firm to adjust how many employees it has, but it cannot immediately build a new factory or install new equipment. In the long-run, both labor and capital can be changed." }, { ques: "Which of the following is NOT a property of isoquants?", ans: "Always non-linear.", ansSel: \["Downward sloping.", "Do not cross.", "Further out is better."\], ansInfo: "Isoquants can be linear when inputs are perfectly substitutable, and thus it is not the case that they are always non-linear." }, { ques: "What is the term used to describe a production function in which you can double all inputs and output increases by more than double?", ans: "Increasing returns to scale.", ansSel: \["Leontief.", "Constant returns to scale.", "Decreasing returns to scale."\], ansInfo: "" }\] }; var options = { allRandom: false, Random: false, help: "", showHTML: false, animationType: 0, showWrongAns: true, title: "Concept test 1", }; $("#quizArea").jQuizMe(quizMulti, options); });
