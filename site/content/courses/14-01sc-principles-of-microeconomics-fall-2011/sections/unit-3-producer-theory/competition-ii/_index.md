Session Overview

We can use this to construct the market supply curve from firms' supply curves. Now we have all the ingredients for fully understanding the basic supply and demand diagrams that launched our study of economics.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_In this lecture, we will learn about the factors that influence a firm's shutdown decision.

_Keywords_: Shutdown decisions; market supply curves; short-run market equilibrium; long-run market equilibrium.

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

$( function($){ var quizMulti = { multiList: \[ { ques: "If you compare the elasticity of short-run supply in the markets for two different goods and one market has more firms than the other, which will have a more elastic supply curve?", ans: "The market with more firms.", ansSel: \["The market with fewer firms.", "There is no difference.", "It depends on the specific production function."\], ansInfo: "The supply curve becomes flatter (more elastic) with more firms in the market, because a given increase in price calls forth more production when there are many firms rather than one." }, { ques: "In the long run, firms should decide to shut down if what condition holds?", ans: "Price is less than both average cost and average variable cost.", ansSel: \["Price is less than average variable cost.", "Price is less than average cost.", "Price is less than average fixed cost."\], ansInfo: "In the long run, all costs are variable, and thus average variable cost and average cost are equivalent. The firm will shut down if price is less than average cost. Average fixed cost is not a relevant concept in the long-run, because all costs are considered to be variable." }, { ques: "In the long run, what cost measure is minimized?", ans: "Average cost.", ansSel: \["Marginal cost.", "Labor supply costs.", "Total cost."\], ansInfo: "In the long-run, average cost is minimized and the equilibrium is found where price equals minimum average costs." }, { ques: "In recent years, the American automobile manufacturing industry has struggled; assume that some companies are earning negative profits (i.e., they are losing money). In the long-run, what changes will we expect to see in this market?", ans: "Firm exit.", ansSel: \["Firm entry.", "A shift toward using more capital than labor.", "A shift toward using more labor than capital."\], ansInfo: "If profits are negative, firms should exit." }, { ques: "Which of the following is a reason that the long-run supply curve may not be flat and may instead be upward-sloping?", ans: "All of these.", ansSel: \["Entry is limited.", "Firms are different (i.e., some have lower costs than others).", "Input prices increase with output."\], ansInfo: "All of these factors will contribute to a failure of the mechanism by which competition leads to cost minimization in the long-run, and thus will generate an upward-sloping supply curve." }\] }; var options = { allRandom: false, Random: false, help: "", showHTML: false, animationType: 0, showWrongAns: true, title: "Concept test 1", }; $("#quizArea").jQuizMe(quizMulti, options); });
