However, firms have the power to decide how many workers to hire. This lecture focuses on the operation of firms in the factor markets that supply the factors (labor and capital) they use in production.{{< br >}}{{< br >}}_A firm made the decision to hire these workers. In this lecture, discover the determinants of this decision! Image courtesy of [Remko Tanis](http://www.flickr.com/photos/remkotanis/4094323478/in/photostream/) on Flickr._{{< br >}}{{< br >}}

### Concept Quiz

This concept quiz covers key vocabulary terms and also tests your intuitive understanding of the material covered in this session. Complete this quiz before moving on to the next session to make sure you understand the concepts required to solve the mathematical and graphical problems that are the basis of this course.

$( function($){ var quizMulti = { multiList: \[ { ques: "In a perfectly competitive labor market, firms should hire workers until the wage is equal to what quantity?", ans: "The price multiplied by the marginal product of labor.", ansSel: \["The marginal revenue.", "The marginal product of labor.", "The price."\], ansInfo: 'The correct answer is the wage should be equal to P\*MP<sub>L</sub>, or the price multiplied by the marginal product of labor. The wage captures the cost of hiring one additional worker, and this should be equal to the benefit of hiring that worker. This is equal to the amount the additional worker will produce (MP<sub>L</sub>) multiplied by the price.' }, { ques: "If the factor supply market is competitive, each firm will face a supply curve for labor that has what characteristic?", ans: "Horizontal.", ansSel: \["Vertical.", "Upward-sloping.", "Downward-sloping."\], ansInfo: "If the factor supply market is competitive, each firm will face a labor supply curve that is horizontal (i.e., perfectly elastic), and the firm can hire as many workers as it wants to at the market wage. The labor supply curve for the entire market, on the other hand, will generally not be horizontal." }, { ques: "How does the elasticity of the long-run demand for labor compare to the elasticity of the short-run demand for labor?", ans: "More elastic.", ansSel: \["Less elastic.", "Equally elastic.", "Depends on the shape of the demand curve."\], ansInfo: "The correct answer is that the demand for labor is more elastic in the long-run than in the short-run. In the short-run, capital is fixed, and thus a firm's ability to adjust its labor supply is typically limited. In the long-run, capital is also flexible, and this extra option makes firm's labor demand more elastic." }, { ques: "If a given labor market is characterized by monopsony (i.e., a company town in which there is only one employer), how does the level of hiring compare to that in a competitive factor market?", ans: "The level of hiring is lower.", ansSel: \["The level of hiring is higher.", "The level of hiring is equal.", "It depends on the price of the output good."\], ansInfo: "The correct answer is that a monopsony will hire fewer workers (the level of hiring is lower) than a competitive market, and it will hire those workers at a lower wage. The reason for this is that when a monopsony seeks to hire more workers, the overall market wage increases, and the firm then has to pay this higher market wage to all its employees. This poisoning effect in the factor market leads the firm to hire fewer workers." }\] }; var options = { allRandom: false, Random: false, help: "", showHTML: false, animationType: 0, showWrongAns: true, title: "Concept test 1", }; $("#quizArea").jQuizMe(quizMulti, options); });
