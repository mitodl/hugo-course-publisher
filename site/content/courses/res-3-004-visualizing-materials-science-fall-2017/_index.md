  <p>Interactive simulation of selected-area diffraction.  The information from
  one spot (top row, middle) of the diffraction image (bottom) of a twin
  boundary (top left) is used to selectively reconstruct (top right) an image
  that contains that spot&rsquo;s periodicity. (Image by Prof. W. Craig
  Carter.)&nbsp;</p>
