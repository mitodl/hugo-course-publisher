course_description: >-
  <p><em>Principles of Computer System Design: An Introduction</em> is published
  in two parts. Part I, containing chapters 1-6, is a traditional printed
  textbook published by Morgan Kaufman, an imprint of Elsevier. Part II,
  containing chapters 7-11, is available here as an open educational
  resource.</p> <p>This textbook, an introduction to the principles and
  abstractions used in the design of computer systems, is an outgrowth of notes
  written for 6.033 <em>Computer System Engineering</em> over a period of
  40-plus years. Individual chapters are also used in other EECS subjects. There
  is also a <a href="http://mit.edu/6.033">Web site for the current 6.033
  class</a> with a lecture schedule that includes daily assignments, lecture
  notes, and lecture slides. The 6.033 class Web site also contains a
  thirteen-year archive of class assignments, design projects, and quizzes.</p>
