Lecture Video
-------------

We finish the topic of acid-base titrations and consider why pKa is so important. Chemist Samuel Thompson talks about a problem he encountered in his undergraduate research that had to do with the pKa of a molecular probe. Learn what the problem was and how he solved it.

[Designing Probes To Image Proteins Inside Living Cells](http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/24168-designing-probes-to-image-proteins-inside-living-cells-2-0)

Samuel Thompson discusses his research on designing new tools to track the movement of proteins within cells. He explains how understanding the relationship between pKa and pH was critical for the design of a new sensor, which he hopes can be used to image proteins in diseased cells.

[Samuel Thompson’s Personal Story](http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/24167-samuel-thompson-s-personal-story)

Samuel Thompson brings a sense of play to his science research that he traces back to his love of the performing arts and his early exposure to science as a child. He also relates that his identity as a gay-man from a conservative Southern town helped shape him into a scientist.
