Lecture Video
-------------

If you have ever tried to get a stain out of a favorite garment or struggled to clean your bathtub after a long period of neglect, this lecture is for you. Understanding solubility is important whether you want to design a new cancer drug, want to save the planet by removing greenhouse gases from the environment like Chemist Hector Hernandez, or if you simply want to get your apartment ready for a visit from your parents.

[Harnessing Microbes For Carbon Dioxide Sequestration](http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/24158-harnessing-microbes-for-carbon-dioxide-sequestration)

Hector Hernandez describes how Le Chatelier’s principle and the effects of pressure on solubility relate to his research on harnessing microbes to remove carbon dioxide from the environment. Hector envisions that his research could someday be used to decrease greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.

[Hector Hernandez's Personal Story](http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/24157-hector-hernandez-s-personal-story)

[Hector Hernandez](http://mecelab.com/team/dr-hector-h-hernandez/) initially worked in construction, but at age 29, he realized he wanted to use his mind instead of his back in his career. With the help of a key-mentor at a community college, he started studying chemistry, a subject that allowed him to apply his mechanical training and introduced him to colleagues who have become like family.
