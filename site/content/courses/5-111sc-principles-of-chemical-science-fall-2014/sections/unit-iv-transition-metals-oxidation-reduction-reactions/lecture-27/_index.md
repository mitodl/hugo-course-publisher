Lecture Video
-------------

A fundamental property of d-block metals (aka transition metals) is that they are predisposed to form coordination complexes, which have a metal in the middle that is surrounded by ions or atoms (aka ligands). These coordination complexes have special properties, which are described in detail in lectures 28 and 29. We also hear from Chemist Sarah Bowman about the importance of the d-block metal nickel.

[Targeting Ulcer Causing _H. pylori_ Bacteria](http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/24152-targeting-ulcer-causing-h-pylori-bacteria)

Sarah Bowman studies a protein from a pathogenic bacterium that is found in the stomach and is known to cause ulcers. She explains how the bacterium survives in the low pH environment of the stomach by using a nickel-dependent protein to buffer the acidity of its environment. Sarah envisions that taking advantage of this nickel requirement could lead to a new treatment for ulcers.

[Sarah Bowman’s Personal Story](http://techtv.mit.edu/videos/24150-sarah-bowman-s-personal-story)

Sarah Bowman shares how she “changed her mind” about careers after completing her first bachelors degree in the humanities and taking a chemistry class that opened her eyes to the wonders of atoms and molecules. She urges people to pursue what they want to do, regardless of age.
