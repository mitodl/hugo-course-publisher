Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _5.111 Principles of Chemical Science_ as it was taught by Professor Catherine Drennan, with assistance from Course Coordinator, Allena Mistral Goren, in Fall 2014.

This course provides an introduction to the chemistry of biological, inorganic, and organic molecules. The emphasis is on basic principles of atomic and molecular electronic structure, thermodynamics, acid-base and redox equilibria, chemical kinetics, and catalysis.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Gain a working knowledge of chemical principles that will allow one to take advanced chemistry classes
*   Appreciate how chemistry is used to solve real-world problems
*   Make informed decisions about one's health, environmental and energy issues, and science policy
*   Advance science and engineering through the application of chemical principles
*   Employ chemistry in one's research in a non-chemistry department laboratory

Curriculum Information
----------------------

### Prerequisites

This course has no formal prerequisites. At MIT, 5.111 is usually taken during the freshman (first) year and instructors assume that students have had only one year of high school chemistry.

### Requirements Satisfied

GIR ![General Institute Requirements](/images/educator/icon-question-gir.png)

### Offered

Every fall and spring semester

The Classroom
-------------

*   ![View of lecture hall from back of the classroom. Tiered seating. Chalkboards and lectern at front of room.](https://open-learning-course-data-ci.s3.amazonaws.com/5-111sc-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2014/caf946f3ea491148c5ba9b6d9ce19df8_5.111_1.jpg)

    ### Lecture
    
    Lectures were held in a classroom with a seating capacity of 425 students. The room was equipped with a motorized chalkboard, wireless internet, a projection booth, and a sound system.
    
*   ![View from front of classroom. Five rows of tablet desks positioned in the center of classroom. Wall of windows to the left of desks.](https://open-learning-course-data-ci.s3.amazonaws.com/5-111sc-principles-of-chemical-science-fall-2014/86a6098732e72d99b76ac2b768577413_5.111_2.jpg)

    ### Recitation
    
    Recitations were held in smaller classrooms equipped with chalkboards and moveable desks.
    

Assessment
----------

The students' grades were based on the following activities:

var pieData = \[ { value: 54, color: "#DD1E2F" }, { value: 27, color: "#EBB035" }, { value: 14, color: "#9ACCEF" }, { value: 5, color: "#218559" } \]; var myPie = new Chart(document.getElementById("canvas5").getContext("2d")).Pie(pieData);

![The color used on the preceding chart which represents the percentage of the total grade contributed by four one-hour exams.](/images/educator/edu_b-lab-key.png) 54% Four one-hour exams

### Typical Student Background

Not all students who enroll in _5.111 Principles of Chemical Science_ come to the course already enthusiastic about chemistry. The course offers them an opportunity to see how chemistry is a modern subject shaping many fields and how it can offer tools useful for solving real-world problems. Learn more about how Professor Drennan conceptualizes [5.111 as a course in which students can develop a passion for chemistry](./resolveuid/cba7f205b4f543458814abd04739e54b).

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

In Class
--------

var pieData = \[ { value: 25, color: "#931101" }, { value: 75, color: "#eee" } \]; var myPie = new Chart(document.getElementById("canvas1").getContext("2d")).Pie(pieData); 3 hours per week

*   Met 3 times per week for 1 hour per session; 39 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
*   Class sessions included lectures, demonstrations, and clicker questions.
*   During lectures, students completed blanks in detailed handouts provided by the instructor.

Recitation
----------

var pieData = \[ { value: 25, color: "#eee" }, { value: 17, color: "#931101" }, { value: 58, color: "#eee" } \]; var myPie = new Chart(document.getElementById("canvas2").getContext("2d")).Pie(pieData); 2 hours per week

*   Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 26 sessions total; mandatory attendance.
*   Recitations included problem solving, review of concepts, and opportunities to ask questions about course material.

Out of Class
------------

var pieData = \[ { value: 42, color: "#eee" }, { value: 58, color: "#931101" } \]; var myPie = new Chart(document.getElementById("canvas3").getContext("2d")).Pie(pieData); 7 hours per week

Students completed problem sets and prepared for exams outside of class. They also participated in [pizza forums](./resolveuid/eb647a418c9bfc0191a9c746a7ef676c), which were opportunities to get to know the professor in small group settings.
