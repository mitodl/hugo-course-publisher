  <p><span m='7210'> Hi.</span> </p><p><span m='7715'>Welcome back to
  recitation.</span> </p><p><span m='9255'>In class, you've been learning about
  convergence tests for</span> <span m='11815'>infinite series.</span>
  </p><p><span m='12835'>I have here three examples of series that I happen to
  like.</span> </p><p><span m='17085'>So the first one is the sum from n equals
  0 to infinity of</span> <span m='21545'>5n plus 2 divided by n cubed plus
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='25195'>The second one is the sum from n equals 1 to
  infinity of the</span> <span m='28585'>quantity 1 plus the square root of 5
  over 2, all that to</span> <span m='32625'>the nth power.</span> </p><p><span
  m='33665'>And the third one is the sum from n equals 1 to infinity of</span>
  <span m='36625'>the natural log of n divided by n squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='39325'>So what I'd like you to do for each of these three series is</span>
  <span m='42535'>to figure out whether or not they converge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='44325'>So whether they converge, or whether they
  diverge.</span> </p><p><span m='46615'>So why don't you pause the video, take
  some time to work</span> <span m='48655'>that out, come back, and we can work
  on it together.</span> </p><p><span m='59920'>Welcome back.</span>
  </p><p><span m='60675'>Hopefully you had some luck working on these
  series.</span> </p><p><span m='63165'>So let's talk about how we do
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='64955'>So I'll start with the first one
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='67005'>So this first one, the function that
  we're, that</span> <span m='70267'>we're summing is this 5n plus 2 divided by
  n cubed plus 3.</span> </p><p><span m='76935'>And so you want to know, does
  that sum of that expression,</span> <span m='81485'>of n goes from 1 to
  infinity, does that converge?</span> </p><p><span m='84445'>Does it reach some
  finite value?</span> </p><p><span m='85935'>Or does it diverge?</span>
  </p><p><span m='87414'>Does it either, you know, oscillate, or go to
  infinity,</span> <span m='91195'>or something like that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='92755'>So for one thing you can always do, is something like a</span> <span
  m='97615'>comparison test. And so what you want to do there, is you</span>
  <span m='99745'>want to extract the information from the</span> <span
  m='102045'>expression for the summand.</span> </p><p><span m='103835'>You want
  to figure out, you know, about how big this is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='106735'>What are the important parts of it?</span> </p><p><span
  m='108575'>So in this case, you have a ratio.</span> </p><p><span
  m='110285'>And so when you have a ratio, what you want to do, is you</span>
  <span m='111884'>want to look at what's the magnitude of the top, and</span>
  <span m='114854'>what's the magnitude of the bottom.</span> </p><p><span
  m='116445'>So roughly speaking, the magnitude of the top is of the</span>
  <span m='119575'>order of n.</span> </p><p><span m='121035'>Right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='121325'>It's 5n.</span> </p><p><span m='122835'>The 5 is just
  a constant multiple.</span> </p><p><span m='124785'>That's not going to make a
  whole big difference.</span> </p><p><span m='126255'>And the plus 2 is just
  much, much, much smaller than the n</span> <span m='129225'>when n gets very,
  very large.</span> </p><p><span m='131115'>So the, we can say that the order
  of magnitude of the top</span> <span m='134715'>here is of the order of n, and
  similarly, the order of</span> <span m='138105'>magnitude of the bottom is of
  the order of n cubed.</span> </p><p><span m='141035'>Right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='141275'>The plus 1 is much, much, much smaller than the n
  cubed, so</span> <span m='144245'>it's not, it's almost insignificant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='148035'>So roughly speaking, we should expect this to be of
  the same</span> <span m='153615'>behavior as if we just had n over n
  cubed,</span> <span m='156795'>which is 1 over n squared.</span> </p><p><span
  m='158445'>And we know that 1 over n squared, the series 1 over n</span> <span
  m='161885'>squared from n equals 1 to infinity, converges.</span> </p><p><span
  m='165035'>So that's sort of just a sort of a way of</span> <span
  m='169375'>thinking about this.</span> </p><p><span m='170115'>And we can
  formalize it using the limit comparison test.</span> </p><p><span
  m='173095'>So the idea here for part A is to use the limit comparison</span>
  <span m='183595'>test. So what we want to compute--</span> <span m='186105'>so
  I'm going to put a 5 in.</span> </p><p><span m='188855'>So I'm going to make
  it 5 over n squared, because we</span> <span m='191225'>had this 5 up
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='192975'>So we have an is equal to 5n plus 2 over
  n cubed plus 1.</span> </p><p><span m='201115'>And I want to limit compare it
  with--</span> <span m='204635'>I'm going to compare my series with the series
  sum from n</span> <span m='215385'>equals 1 to infinity of 5 over n
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='219495'>Now--</span> <span m='221215'>I'm
  talking about this 5, right?</span> </p><p><span m='223005'>This 5 doesn't
  matter.</span> </p><p><span m='224225'>If this series-- if 1 over n squared,
  that sum converges</span> <span m='228615'>then 5 over n squared, that sum
  converges to exactly 5</span> <span m='232385'>times as much.</span>
  </p><p><span m='233165'>And if, you know, if I wrote a divergent thing here,
  and then</span> <span m='236245'>multiplied it by 5, the result multiplied
  by</span> <span m='238565'>5 would still diverge.</span> </p><p><span
  m='239765'>So this constant multiple isn't going to matter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='241665'>And I'm just choosing, I'm just putting the 5 in
  there</span> <span m='244185'>because of this 5 we saw over here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='246925'>So OK.</span> </p><p><span m='247625'>So let's select
  work it out, then.</span> </p><p><span m='249735'>So the limit comparison test
  says--</span> <span m='252845'>so we look at the limit as n goes to infinity
  of the ratio</span> <span m='258274'>of the two things that we're interested
  in.</span> </p><p><span m='260285'>So in this case, this is 5n and plus 2 over
  n cubed plus</span> <span m='265455'>1, divided by 5 over n squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='270985'>And you can--</span> <span m='271535'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='271715'>So this is a ratio of two ratios, so we can rewrite
  it</span> <span m='275695'>by multiplying upstairs, and we get that this is
  equal to</span> <span m='279235'>the limit as n goes to infinity of 5n cubed
  plus 2 n</span> <span m='288705'>squared over 5n cubed plus 5.</span>
  </p><p><span m='293655'>And so we've seen before, when we were dealing with
  limits,</span> <span m='296835'>that when you have a ratio of two polynomials,
  as the</span> <span m='300645'>variable goes to infinity, the limit is what
  you get just by</span> <span m='304595'>comparing the leading terms. So in
  this case, we just have</span> <span m='308375'>to look at 5n cubed over 5n
  cubed, and that's indeed 1.</span> </p><p><span m='312605'>OK, so this is
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='313735'>So by the limit comparison test, our series,
  the sum of</span> <span m='319085'>this an, converges if and only if this
  series converges.</span> </p><p><span m='323265'>And we already said that we
  know sum 1</span> <span m='325375'>over n squared converges.</span>
  </p><p><span m='327055'>So by the limit comparison test, since sum 1 over
  n</span> <span m='329585'>squared converges, our series converges.</span>
  </p><p><span m='336630'>Great.</span> </p><p><span m='337175'>OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='337585'>So that's the first one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='339905'>Let's look at the second one.</span> </p><p><span m='341965'>So the
  second one here is the sum from n equals 1 to</span> <span m='345485'>infinity
  of 1 plus the square root of 5 over 2.</span> </p><p><span m='349555'>That
  whole thing to the nth power.</span> </p><p><span m='351755'>Now, if you look
  at this, the thing you should recognize</span> <span m='354135'>this as, is
  just a particular geometric series.</span> </p><p><span
  m='357485'>Right?</span> </p><p><span m='357895'>This is, if you were to
  replace 1 plus the square root</span> <span m='361125'>of 5 over 2 with x,
  this is just x plus x squared plus x</span> <span m='364877'>cubed plus dot
  dot dot dot dot.</span> </p><p><span m='366925'>It's just a geometric series
  with constant ratio--</span> <span m='370835'>well, x .</span> </p><p><span
  m='371655'>1 plus the square root of 5 over 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='373795'>So we know exactly when geometric series converge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='378545'>They converge exactly when the constant ratio is
  between</span> <span m='384435'>minus 1 and 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='385665'>So bigger than minus 1 and less than 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='388285'>So this series converges, then, if and only if 1 plus</span> <span
  m='391605'>the square root of 5 over 2 is between minus 1 and 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='394555'>So then we just have to think about, is this number
  between</span> <span m='397335'>minus 1 and 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='399015'>And OK.</span> </p><p><span m='400005'>So this is not that hard to
  do.</span> </p><p><span m='401435'>Square root of 5 is bigger than 2, so 1
  plus the square</span> <span m='404555'>root of 5 is bigger than 3, so 1 plus
  the square root of 5</span> <span m='407135'>over 2 is bigger than 3/2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='409495'>So 3/2 is bigger than 1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='411175'>So this common ratio in this series is bigger than 1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='416625'>So the terms of this series are blowing ip.</span>
  </p><p><span m='419665'>You know, when you, when n gets bigger and bigger,
  you're</span> <span m='422105'>adding larger and larger numbers here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='423735'>This is blowing up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='424575'>It's a divergent geometric series.</span> </p><p><span
  m='426825'>So this series does not converge.</span> </p><p><span m='428210'>So
  b, I'll just write that here.</span> </p><p><span m='434605'>B diverges,
  because it's geometric with common ratio</span> <span m='447465'>bigger than
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='448515'>So that's the reason that part B
  diverges.</span> </p><p><span m='451925'>Finally, we're left with question
  C.</span> </p><p><span m='454284'>So I'm going to come over and write it over
  here again, so</span> <span m='458365'>we can see it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='458885'>So part C asks the sum for n equals 1 to infinity of log n</span>
  <span m='469425'>over n squared.</span> </p><p><span m='473360'>So this one's
  a little trickier, and it requires a</span> <span m='475305'>little bit more
  thought.</span> </p><p><span m='475941'>The thing to-- do let's start just
  by--</span> <span m='482490'>it can't be solved just by a straightforward
  application of</span> <span m='486475'>the limit comparison test that we've
  learned.</span> </p><p><span m='490775'>So we need to think a little bit more
  about what ways could</span> <span m='493905'>we solve it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='495725'>So one thing to remember here is, is we should think about,</span>
  <span m='499435'>what are the magnitudes of these things?</span> </p><p><span
  m='501485'>So we know that sum 1 over n squared converges.</span> </p><p><span
  m='504565'>But log n is a function that grows.</span> </p><p><span
  m='507675'>So this individual term is bigger than 1 over n squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='511445'>So we can't just compare it to 1 over n
  squared.</span> </p><p><span m='515655'>But log n grows very, very
  slowly.</span> </p><p><span m='518044'>How slowly?</span> </p><p><span
  m='518914'>Well, it grows more slowly than any power of x.</span> </p><p><span
  m='521945'>Right?</span> </p><p><span m='523475'>So, or-- sorry-- any power of
  n in this case, because the</span> <span m='525235'>variable is n.</span>
  </p><p><span m='526755'>So if you remember, we know, we've shown, that the
  limit of</span> <span m='537785'>ln x over x to the p as x goes to infinity is
  equal to 0 for</span> <span m='550045'>any positive p.</span> </p><p><span
  m='553475'>So ln, log n, ln n, is going to infinity, but it's going to</span>
  <span m='559455'>infinity much slower than any power of n.</span> </p><p><span
  m='564575'>In this case.</span> </p><p><span m='565425'>Or x, down
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='567695'>So OK.</span> </p><p><span m='568735'>So
  what does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='569895'>Well, one thing you could
  do, is you could say, oh, OK.</span> </p><p><span m='572105'>So ln n over n,
  that's getting really small.</span> </p><p><span m='576015'>And then what
  we're left with is 1 over n.</span> </p><p><span m='578295'>So you can say,
  OK.</span> </p><p><span m='579085'>So this is much smaller than 1 over
  n.</span> </p><p><span m='582065'>The problem is that the sum 1 over n
  diverges.</span> </p><p><span m='585515'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span
  m='585865'>So that doesn't help us, really, right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='587665'>So we've shown this is bigger than the sum 1 over n squared,</span>
  <span m='592655'>which converges, and it's smaller than the sum 1 over
  n,</span> <span m='596465'>which diverges.</span> </p><p><span m='597605'>But
  that still doesn't tell us, you know?</span> </p><p><span m='599195'>It could
  be something that, you know, there's a lot of</span> <span m='602625'>room
  bigger than a particular convergent series, and smaller</span> <span
  m='606425'>than a particular divergent series.</span> </p><p><span
  m='608165'>And in particular, there are both convergent and divergent</span>
  <span m='610835'>series in between.</span> </p><p><span m='611985'>So we still
  need, we need either something that</span> <span m='614485'>converges that our
  thing is less than, or we need</span> <span m='618255'>something that diverges
  that our thing is bigger than.</span> </p><p><span m='621595'>Right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='621795'>If we can bound our series above by something
  convergent,</span> <span m='624995'>then our series converges.</span>
  </p><p><span m='626505'>Because [UNINTELLIGIBLE]</span> <span m='627285'>has
  positive terms. This is important.</span> </p><p><span m='629365'>Or if we can
  bound it below by something that diverges, then</span> <span m='632425'>we
  would know it diverges.</span> </p><p><span m='633865'>And so far, we haven't
  been able to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='637125'>But maybe we can think of
  a-- so I said we could write this,</span> <span m='641990'>a second ago, I
  said we could write ln n over n squared is</span> <span m='646525'>equal to ln
  n and over n times 1 over n.</span> </p><p><span m='651455'>So that was what
  we just said a minute ago, at which we</span> <span m='655315'>showed is
  eventually less than 1 over n.</span> </p><p><span m='660255'>So this is true,
  but it wasn't useful, because the sum 1 over</span> <span m='663185'>n
  diverges.</span> </p><p><span m='664865'>But maybe we can, we can do something
  even</span> <span m='667105'>a little more tricky.</span> </p><p><span
  m='668835'>Because here we saw that x, we could use it in the base, we</span>
  <span m='673575'>could use any power of the variable, any positive
  power.</span> </p><p><span m='677385'>So here, we tried it with the power n to
  the 1.</span> </p><p><span m='680105'>We tried to split this 2 as 1 plus 1,
  and we kept one of the</span> <span m='683295'>n's to knock out the log n, and
  we kept the</span> <span m='685975'>other n over here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='687655'>But we don't need a whole power of n to</span> <span
  m='690095'>knock out the log n.</span> </p><p><span m='691245'>Any positive
  power of n would do.</span> </p><p><span m='695215'>So in particular, we could
  split this using, say, just a</span> <span m='698795'>small power of n, even
  smaller than the first power here, and</span> <span m='702585'>leave more of
  it over here.</span> </p><p><span m='704085'>So we also know, we also have
  that ln n over n squared is</span> <span m='714295'>equal to, for example, ln
  n over--</span> <span m='719215'>well, you know, for example, n to the 1/2
  times 1</span> <span m='725265'>over n to the 3/2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='729215'>And now we know that ln n over n to the 1/2 goes to 0 as n</span>
  <span m='735015'>gets large.</span> </p><p><span m='735815'>So this is thing
  is getting smaller</span> <span m='737645'>and smaller and smaller.</span>
  </p><p><span m='738685'>So as this gets smaller, we have that this has to be
  less</span> <span m='743555'>than 1 over n to the 3/2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='747165'>So this thing that we're adding up here is smaller than</span>
  <span m='751275'>1 over n to the 3/2.</span> </p><p><span m='753185'>Well,
  what's the significance of that?</span> </p><p><span m='754585'>Well, we know
  1 over n to the 3/2, that series converges.</span> </p><p><span
  m='758635'>Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m='759365'>We know the sum 1 over n to
  the 3/2 from n equals 1 to</span> <span m='767025'>infinity converges, because
  3/2 is bigger than 1.</span> </p><p><span m='774085'>OK?</span> </p><p><span
  m='774655'>So what does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='775405'>Well, we
  have our series, and we've shown that the terms of</span> <span m='779165'>our
  series are eventually bounded below 1</span> <span m='782695'>over n to the
  3/2.</span> </p><p><span m='784325'>And we know that the sum of 1 over n to
  the 3/2 converges,</span> <span m='788185'>so our series is bounded above by a
  convergent series.</span> </p><p><span m='792035'>So whenever you have a
  series bounded above, a series of</span> <span m='794545'>non-negative terms
  bounded above, by a convergent series,</span> <span m='797885'>that means your
  series also has to converge.</span> </p><p><span m='801495'>OK, so this
  converges.</span> </p><p><span m='804423'>So it converges by a
  comparison</span> <span m='807265'>to this other series.</span> </p><p><span
  m='808375'>Using this cute trick that we can replace a log with any</span>
  <span m='813015'>small positive power of n that happens to be
  convenient.</span> </p><p><span m='816875'>And of course, if you wanted to,
  maybe you could have made</span> <span m='819325'>this 1/2 a 1/10 and that
  would have been fine, or you</span> <span m='822575'>could've even made it a
  9/10, and then you would here be</span> <span m='825755'>left with n to the
  11/10, and that would still be OK.</span> </p><p><span m='829315'>Because that
  would be 11/10, and 11/10, then it would still</span> <span m='833065'>be
  bigger than 1.</span> </p><p><span m='834575'>All right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='835935'>So this is a nice use of a, of a comparison test. We didn't</span>
  <span m='839845'>use exactly the limit comparison test as it was</span> <span
  m='842335'>described in lecture, but it's a very closely related
