Overview
--------

Often, our goal in solving a problem is to find extreme values. We might want to launch a probe as high as possible or to minimize the fuel consumption of a jet plane. Sometimes we'll find our answer on the boundaries of our range of options -- we launch the probe straight up. Sometimes we'll find the best answer by using a derivative to determine when the graph of a function "levels out" at the top of a peak or bottom of a dip.
