Overview
--------

Earlier we studied linear and quadratic approximations. If we continue to improve our approximations by using the third, fourth, fifth, ... derivatives the result is a power series. These power series are called Taylor's series. This session gives a formula describing the terms of a Taylor's series and a few examples of its application.
