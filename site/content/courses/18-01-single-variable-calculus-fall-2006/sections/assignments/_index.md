Students will need both the course textbook ([![Buy at Amazon](/images/a_logo_17.gif)](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0070576424/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20) Simmons, George F. _Calculus with Analytic Geometry_. 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill, October 1, 1996, ISBN: 9780070576421) and the [course reader]({{% getpage "courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/sections/readings/course-reader" %}}) (18.01/18.01A Supplementary Notes, Exercises and Solutions; Jerison, D., and A. Mattuck. _Calculus 1)_ to complete the assigned problem sets. The course reader is where to find the exercises labeled 1A, 1B, etc.

Problem sets have two parts, I and II

Part I consists of exercises given in the course reader and solved in section S of the course reader. It will be graded quickly, checking that all is there and the solutions not copied.

Part II consists of problems for which solutions are not given; it is worth more points. Some of these problems are longer multi-part exercises posed here because they do not fit conveniently into an exam or short-answer format. See the guidelines below for what collaboration is acceptable, and follow them.

To encourage you to keep up with the lectures, both Part I and Part II tell you for each problem on which class session day you will have the needed background for it.

Homework Rules
--------------

Collaboration on problem sets is encouraged, but

1.  Attempt each part of each problem yourself. Read each portion of the problem before asking for help. If you don't understand what is being asked, ask for help interpreting the problem and then make an honest attempt to solve it.
2.  Write up each problem independently. On both Part A and B exercises you are expected to write the answer in your own words.
3.  Write on your problem set whom you consulted and the sources you used. If you fail to do so, you may be charged with plagiarism and subject to serious penalties.
4.  It is illegal to consult materials from previous semesters.

Key to Notation
---------------

2.1 = Section 2.1 of the Simmons book

Notes G = section G of the [Notes (Course Reader)]({{% getpage "courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/sections/readings/course-reader" %}})

1A-3 = Exercise 1A-3 in Section E (Exercises) of the [Notes]({{% getpage "courses/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/sections/readings/course-reader" %}}) (solved in section S)

2.4/13; 81/4 = in Simmons, respectively, section 2.4 Problem 13; page 81 Problem 4
