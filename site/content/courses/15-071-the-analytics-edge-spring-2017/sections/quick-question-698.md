Quick Question
--------------

eHarmony has a distinguishing feature, that makes it stand out from other online dating websites? What is this?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;eHarmony was the first online dating site.&nbsp;

&nbsp;eHarmony asks users for personal information.&nbsp;

&nbsp;eHarmony charges a fee to users.&nbsp;

&nbsp;eHarmony only suggests matches to users, instead of allowing users to browse. &nbsp;

Explanation

eHarmony was not the first online dating site, and while they ask users for personal information and charge a fee, other online dating sites do that as well. What distinguishes eHarmony is that they only suggest matches to users, instead of allowing users to browse other users' profiles.
