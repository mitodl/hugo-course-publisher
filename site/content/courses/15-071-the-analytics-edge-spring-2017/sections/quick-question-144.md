Quick Question
--------------

Which of the following dependent variables are categorical? (Select all that apply.)

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock&nbsp;

&nbsp;The weekly revenue of a company &nbsp;

&nbsp;The winner of an election with two candidates&nbsp;

&nbsp;The day of the week with the highest revenue&nbsp;

&nbsp;The number of daily car thefts in New York City&nbsp;

&nbsp;Whether or not revenue will exceed $50,000&nbsp;

Explanation

The weekly revenue of a company is not categorical, since it has a large number of possible values, on a continuous range. The number of daily car thefts in New York City is also not categorical because the number of car thefts could range from 0 to hundreds.

On the other hand, the other options each have a limiited number of possible outcomes.

Which of the following dependent variables are binary? (Select all that apply.)

Exercise 2

&nbsp;The number of car thefts in New York City&nbsp;

Explanation

The only variables with two possible outcomes are the winner of an election with two candidates, and whether or not revenue will exceed $50,000.
