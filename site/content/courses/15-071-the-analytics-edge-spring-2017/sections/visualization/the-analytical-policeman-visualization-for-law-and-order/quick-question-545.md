Quick Question
--------------

For which of the following situations would a heat map be an appropriate visualization choice? Select all that apply.

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Determining if crime is higher or lower on warmer days&nbsp;

&nbsp;Visualizing the areas on a geographical map with the most crime&nbsp;

&nbsp;Comparing crime counts by police district and time throughout a city&nbsp;

&nbsp;Analyzing which months of the year have the most crime on average&nbsp;

Explanation

A heatmap would be useful for the middle two options, because they are trying to visualize crime counts relative to two variables. For the first option, you could use a basic scatterplot with time on the x-axis and amount of crime on the y-axis. For the last option, you could use a bar plot with a bar for each month and the height being the average amount of crime in that month.
