Quick Question
--------------

While we don't have all of the data we would ideally like to have in this problem (like test results), we can define new variables using the data we do have. Which of the following were new variables defined to help predict healthcare cost? Select all that apply.

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Variables to capture chronic conditions&nbsp;

&nbsp;Noncompliance to treatment&nbsp;

&nbsp;Illness severity&nbsp;

&nbsp;Interactions between illnesses&nbsp;

Explanation

All of these variables were defined using the claims data to improve cost predictions. This shows how the intuition of experts can be used to define new variables and improve the model.
