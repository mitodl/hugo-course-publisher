Quick Question
--------------

A common problem in analytics is that you have some data available, but it's not the ideal dataset. This is the case for this problem, where we only have claims data. Which of the following pieces of information would we ideally _like to have_ in our dataset, but are _not included_ in claims data? (Select all that apply.)

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Blood test results&nbsp;

&nbsp;Drugs prescribed to the patient&nbsp;

&nbsp;Physical exam results (weight, height, blood pressure, etc.)&nbsp;

Explanation

In claims data, we have drugs prescribed to the patient, but we don't have blood test results or physical exam results.
