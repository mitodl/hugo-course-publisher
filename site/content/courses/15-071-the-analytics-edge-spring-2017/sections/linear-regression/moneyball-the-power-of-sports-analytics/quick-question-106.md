Quick Question
--------------

If a baseball team scores 713 runs and allows 614 runs, how many games do we expect the team to win?

Using the linear regression model constructed during the lecture, enter the number of games we expect the team to win:

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

Explanation

Our linear regression model was

Wins = 80.88 + 0.1058\*(Run Difference)

Here, the run difference is 99, so our prediction is

Wins = 80.88 + 0.1058\*99 = 91 games.
