Quick Question
--------------

The plots below show the relationship between two of the independent variables considered by Ashenfelter and the price of wine.

![Plot of price vs. average growing season temperature.](https://open-learning-course-data.s3.amazonaws.com/15-071-the-analytics-edge-spring-2017/5ad4d62205c0fb3bc07e63ce035d5c43_Wine_QQ1_Plot1.png) ![Plot of price vs. harvest rainfall.](https://open-learning-course-data.s3.amazonaws.com/15-071-the-analytics-edge-spring-2017/53ba2e1c4dece92e46f81091cad607c1_Wine_QQ1_Plot2.png)

What is the correct relationship between harvest rain, average growing season temperature, and wine prices?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;More harvest rain is associated with a higher price, and higher temperatures is associated with a higher price&nbsp;

&nbsp;More harvest rain is associated with a higher price, and higher temperatures is associated with a lower price&nbsp;

&nbsp;More harvest rain is associated with a lower price, and higher temperatures is associated with a higher price&nbsp;

&nbsp;More harvest rain is associated with a lower price, and higher temperatures is associated with a lower price&nbsp;

Explanation

The plots show a positive trend between average growing season temperature and the wine price. While the trend is less clear between harvest rain and price, there is a slight negative association.
