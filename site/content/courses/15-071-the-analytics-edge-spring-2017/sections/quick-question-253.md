Quick Question
--------------

How much data do you think Andrew Martin should use to build his model?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Information from all cases with the same set of justices as those he is trying to predict. Data from cases where the justices were different might just add noise to our problem.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Only information from the most recent year. Since the justices change every year, only this information would be useful.&nbsp;

Explanation

Andrew Martin should use all data from the cases with the same set of justices. The justices do not change every year, and typically you want to use as much data as you have available.
