Quick Question
--------------

Which of these problems is the **least** likely to be a good application of natural language processing?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Processing medical records to extract symptoms&nbsp;

&nbsp;Judging the winner of a poetry contest&nbsp;

&nbsp;Flagging customer reviews on Amazon as problematic&nbsp;

&nbsp;Automatically organizing emails based on their content&nbsp;

Explanation

Judging the winner of a poetry contest requires a deep level of human understanding and emotion. Perhaps someday a computer will be able to accurately judge the winner of a poetry contest, but currently the other three tasks are much better suited for natural language processing.
