Quick Question
--------------

In the previous video, we discussed a Head and Neck case with 132,878 voxels total, 9,777 voxels in the tumor, and 328 beamlets.

How many decision variables does our optimization model have?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

Explanation

Our decision variables are for the intensities of the beamlets. So in this case, we would have 328 decision variables, which is the number of beamlets.
