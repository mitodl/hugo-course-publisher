  <p><em>Learn Differential Equations:  Up Close with </em><em><em>Gilbert
  Strang</em> and </em><em>Cleve Moler</em> is an in-depth series of videos
  about differential equations and the MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup> ODE suite.  These
  videos are suitable for students and life-long learners to enjoy.</p><h2
  class="subhead">About the Instructors</h2>  <p>Gilbert Strang is the MathWorks
  Professor of Mathematics at MIT. His research focuses on mathematical
  analysis, linear algebra and PDEs. He has written textbooks on linear algebra,
  computational science, finite elements, wavelets, GPS, and
  calculus.</p><p>Cleve Moler is chief mathematician, chairman, and cofounder
  of  MathWorks. He was a professor of math and computer science for almost 20 
  years at the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the  University
  of New Mexico.</p> <p>These videos were produced by <a
