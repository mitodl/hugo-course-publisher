Cleve Moler, founder and chief mathematician at MathWorks, and Gilbert Strang, professor and mathematician at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, provide an overview to their in-depth video series about differential equations and the MATLABÂ® ODE suite.

Differential equations and linear algebra are two crucial subjects in science and engineering. Gilbert Strang's video series develops those subjects both separately and together and supplements Gil Strang's textbook on this subject. Cleve Moler introduces computation for differential equations and explains the MATLAB ODE suite and its mathematical background. Cleve Moler's video series starts with Euler method and builds up to Runge Kutta and includes hands-on MATLAB exercises.
