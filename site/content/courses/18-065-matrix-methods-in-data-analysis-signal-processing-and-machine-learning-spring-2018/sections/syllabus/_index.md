Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[_18.06 Linear Algebra_](./resolveuid/b89637d2d64abf7896f604f5d40d48a9)

Description
-----------

Linear algebra concepts are key for understanding and creating machine learning algorithms, especially as applied to deep learning and neural networks. This course reviews linear algebra with applications to probability and statistics and optimization–and above all a full explanation of deep learning.

Strang, Gilbert. _Linear Algebra and Learning from Data_. [Wellesley-Cambridge Press](http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/), 2019. ISBN: 9780692196380.

Professor Strang created [a website for the book](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/), including a link to the ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[Table of Contents (PDF)](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/learningfromdata/dsla_toc.pdf), sample chapters, and essays on ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[Deep Learning (PDF)](http://math.mit.edu/%7Egs/learningfromdata/SIAM03.pdf) and ![This resource may not render correctly in a screen reader.](/images/inacessible.gif)[Neural Nets (PDF)](http://math.mit.edu/%7Egs/learningfromdata/dsla_dlnn.pdf).

Requirements and Grading
------------------------

There are homework assignments, labs, and a final project. The grade is based on all three elements. NOTE to OCW USERS: The OCW site includes problems assigned for every lecture, aligned with readings in the course textbook. The on-campus students had weekly problem sets.
