Professor Strang's Related Courses on OCW
-----------------------------------------

Professor Strang's foundational course [_18.06 Linear Algebra_](./resolveuid/aabc44bdb2e45374d62f30f2a6d4c63e) has long been one of the most popular courses on OCW. It has received more than 10 million visits since its first publication in 2002. Professor Strang also has a website dedicated to his [linear algebra teaching](http://math.mit.edu/linearalgebra).

A new version of this classic Linear Algebra course was released in 2011 in the innovative OCW Scholar format designed for independent learners. _[18.06SC Linear Algebra](./resolveuid/b89637d2d64abf7896f604f5d40d48a9)_ includes 35 lecture videos and 36 short (and highly-praised) problem-solving help videos by teaching assistants.

Professor Strang has continued to offer new insights into key mathematics subjects. In 2014, he published the new textbook _[Differential Equations and Linear Algebra](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/dela/)_. In 2016, that textbook was developed into a series of 55 short videos supported by MathWorks, with parallel videos about numerical solutions by Dr. Cleve Moler, the creator of MATLAB®. The textbook and video lectures help students in a basic ordinary differential equations course. This new series, [_Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with Gilbert Strang and Cleve Moler_](./resolveuid/b8aa6e9e746d1414f96b0d1cc1545f0b), is also available on the [MathWorks website](http://www.mathworks.com/academia/courseware/learn-differential-equations.html).

Professor Strang's latest course on the topic is _[A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra](./resolveuid/cba1c1e22f7f7fa307e155fd4c9215ef)_. These six brief videos contain ideas and suggestions from Professor Strang about the recommended order of topics in teaching and learning linear algebra. The first topic is called _A New Way to Start Linear Algebra_. That leads to _The Column Space of a Matrix_. The remaining videos outline very briefly the full course: _The Big Picture of Linear Algebra_; _Orthogonal Vectors_; _Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors_; and _Singular Values & Singular Vectors_.
