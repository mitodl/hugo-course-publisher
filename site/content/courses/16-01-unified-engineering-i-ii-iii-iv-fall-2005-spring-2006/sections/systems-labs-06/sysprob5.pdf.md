  This file contains the exercise which contains Test a three-dimensional truss
  under transverse loading; (b) Measure its load-deflection characteristics and
  the strain in its internal bars/members; (c) Use the strain to determine the
  loads in the internal bars/members; (d) Compare the loads to values from
  analysis of a two-dimensional model of the truss; (e) Write a short laboratory
  report documenting your findings.
