  This resource contains information on rules for the end of semester
  competition. During the spring semester, most systems problems relate to the
  semester's aerial design competition.  Teams of four or five students work
  together to design an aircraft to achieve the highest score. To optimize their
  system, each team must evaluate trades between payload, endurance,
  maneuverability and durability, subject to the constraints and objectives of
  the aerial competition.
