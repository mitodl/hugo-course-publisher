Learning Objectives
-------------------

16.01-16.02 Systems and Labs ([PDF]({{% getpage "courses/16-01-unified-engineering-i-ii-iii-iv-fall-2005-spring-2006/sections/systems-labs-04/fall_2003_systems_lo" %}}))

Systems Problems
----------------

The assignments linked in this section, or "Systems Problems", are assigned in addition to the weekly problem set. Systems problems emphasize the interdependence between disciplines, while problem sets usually focus on specific topics within a discipline. Systems problems are usually more open-ended than problem sets, and may be design-related (e.g., a trade study) or lab-related (e.g., a lab report). Because different methods may be applied to complete a systems problem, different solutions are acceptable. For some of the assignments, grading guidelines, or "Grading Sheets," are provided instead of solutions.

Aerial Competition
------------------

During the spring semester, most systems problems relate to the semester's aerial design competition. Teams of four or five students work together to design an aircraft to achieve the highest score. To optimize their system, each team must evaluate trades between payload, endurance, maneuverability and durability, subject to the constraints and objectives of the aerial competition.

### Videos

On competition day, each team was assigned a 15-minute flight window. Flight attempts during this period were scored by the graduate TAs. A selection of teams were interviewed, and their flight attempts filmed. The teams were interviewed pre-flight and post-flight. In the pre-flight interview, each team describes its aircraft design and its predicted performance. In the post-flight interview, the teams reflect on their performance in the competition and their experiences preparing as a team. Flight attempts which occurred between the pre-flight and post-flight interview were also filmed, with commentary by Prof. Coleman, the Systems and Labs instructor.
