description: >-
  This lab is designed to provide you with an opportunity to verify that simple
  beam theory provides a good prediction of the deformation and stresses in a
  beam and hence to explore the underlying assumptions. The laboratory consists
  of three related experiments, each of which probes one of the predictions of
  beam theory.
