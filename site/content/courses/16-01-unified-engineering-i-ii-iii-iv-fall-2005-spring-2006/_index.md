course_description: >-
  <p>The basic objective of Unified Engineering is to give a solid understanding
  of the fundamental disciplines of aerospace engineering, as well as their
  interrelationships and applications. These disciplines are Materials and
  Structures (M); Computers and Programming (C); Fluid Mechanics (F);
  Thermodynamics (T); Propulsion (P); and Signals and Systems (S). In choosing
  to teach these subjects in a unified manner, the instructors seek to explain
  the common intellectual threads in these disciplines, as well as their
  combined application to solve engineering Systems Problems (SP). Throughout
  the year, the instructors emphasize the connections among the disciplines.</p>
