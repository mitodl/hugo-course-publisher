Instructors and guest lecturers will examine various renewable and conventional energy production technologies, energy end-use practices and alternatives, and consumption practices in different countries. Students will learn a quantitative framework to aid in evaluation and analysis of energy technology system proposals in the context of engineering, political, social, economic, and environmental goals. Undergraduate students enroll in _Introduction to Sustainable Energy_ and graduate students enroll in _Sustainable Energy_.
