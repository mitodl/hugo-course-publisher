course_description: >-
  <p>Patrick Winston's <em>How to Speak</em> talk has been an MIT tradition for
  over 40 years. Offered every January during the&nbsp;Independent Activities
  Period (IAP), usually to overflow crowds, the talk is intended to improve your
  speaking ability in critical situations by teaching you a few heuristic rules.
  Professor Winston's collection of rules is presented along with examples of
  their application in job-interview talks, thesis defenses, oral examinations,
  and lectures.</p><h2 class="subhead">About Professor Winston</h2><p>A
