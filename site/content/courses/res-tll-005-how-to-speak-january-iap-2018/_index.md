Patrick Winston's _How to Speak_ talk has been an MIT tradition for over 40 years. Offered every January during the Independent Activities Period (IAP), usually to overflow crowds, the talk is intended to improve your speaking ability in critical situations by teaching you a few heuristic rules. Professor Winston's collection of rules is presented along with examples of their application in job-interview talks, thesis defenses, oral examinations, and lectures.
