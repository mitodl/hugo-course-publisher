Professor Winston’s Courses on OCW
----------------------------------

Professor Winston was widely known for teaching _[6.034 Artificial Intelligence](/courses/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010)_, a class that introduced students to the basic knowledge representation, problem solving, and learning methods of artificial intelligence.

Another course long taught by Professor Winston was _[6.803 The Human Intelligence Enterprise](./resolveuid/8a095d0d68d7a24a5ea4c7d6aa5687d4),_ which was designed to help students learn about progress toward the scientific goal of understanding human intelligence from a computational point of view.

The Greatest Computing Innovation
---------------------------------

Patrick gave [his last public talk](https://youtu.be/vCyZUiBr_ds?t=1929) at the launch event for the MIT Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing on Feb. 26, 2019. “What is the greatest computing innovation of all time?” he asked. His answer: “It’s us.”

The [obituary for Professor Winston](http://thetech.com/2019/07/23/professor-patrick-winston-obit) in the student newspaper _The Tech_ touches on some wonderful and heartfelt tributes, including this from Richard Yip ’17, a former TA for 6.034: “His classes were never just about artificial intelligence. He taught his students how to think, how to act, and how to lead a worthy, fulfilling life.”
