course_description: >-
  Geology is the core discipline of the earth sciences and encompasses many
  different phenomena, including plate tectonics and mountain building,
  volcanoes and earthquakes, and the long-term evolution of Earthâ€™s atmosphere,
  surface and life. Because of the ever-increasing demand for resources, the
  growing exposure to natural hazards, and the changing climate, geology is of
  considerable societal relevance. This course introduces students to the basics
  of geology. Through a combination of lectures, labs, and field observations,
  we will address topics ranging from mineral and rock identification to the
  origin of the continents, from geologic mapping to plate tectonics, and from
  erosion by rivers and glaciers to the history of life.
