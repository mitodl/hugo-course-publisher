  <p>The North America Tapestry of Time and Terrain. This map is a portrait of
  the land surface of North America and the ages of its underlying rock
  formations. This digital tapestry outlines the geologic story of continental
  collision and break-up, mountain-building, river erosion and deposition,
  ice-cap glaciation, volcanism, and other events and processes that have shaped
  the region over the last 2.6 billion years. (Image and text courtesy of the <a

Geology is the core discipline of the earth sciences and encompasses many different phenomena, including plate tectonics and mountain building, volcanoes and earthquakes, and the long-term evolution of Earthâ€™s atmosphere, surface and life. Because of the ever-increasing demand for resources, the growing exposure to natural hazards, and the changing climate, geology is of considerable societal relevance. This course introduces students to the basics of geology. Through a combination of lectures, labs, and field observations, we will address topics ranging from mineral and rock identification to the origin of the continents, from geologic mapping to plate tectonics, and from erosion by rivers and glaciers to the history of life.
