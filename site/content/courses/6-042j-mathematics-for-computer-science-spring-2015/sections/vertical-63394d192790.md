Span all the Graphs!
--------------------

  

Fill in the blanks!

1.  If a graph is \_\_\_\_\_, then it is guaranteed to have a spanning tree.
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp;simpleacyclic2-colorableconnected connected&nbsp;
    
  
3.  A \_\_\_\_\_ of graph \\(G \\) has all the vertices of \\(G \\).
    
    Exercise 2
    
    &nbsp;exact copyspanning treespanning subgraph{all of the above}{none of the above} {all of the above}&nbsp;
    
  
5.  Any minimum \_\_\_\_\_ connected spanning \_\_\_\_\_ is a spanning \_\_\_\_\_, as proved by the Well-Ordering Principle.
    
    Exercise 3
    
    &nbsp;edge, tree, graphweight, tree, graphedge, graph, treeweight, graph, tree edge, graph, tree&nbsp;
    
  
7.  We can build a minimum spanning tree using the gray-edges technique, which involves coloring \_\_\_\_\_ black and white, selecting the \_\_\_\_\_ gray edge, and reiterating until we obtain a tree.
    
    Exercise 4
