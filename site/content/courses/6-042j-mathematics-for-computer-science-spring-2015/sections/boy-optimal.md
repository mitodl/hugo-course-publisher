Boy Optimal
-----------

What is the definition of a "boy optimal" marriage?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;The boy is married to the highest ranked girl he can stably marryAll boys get married to the girl at the top of their listsEach girl is married to the lowest ranked boy she can stably marryA rogue marriage, but the boy is satisfied The boy is married to the highest ranked girl he can stably marry&nbsp;

It is true that the marriages in which each girl is married to her lowest ranked partner in any stable marriage set - the girl pessimal matching - is the same as the boy optimal matching. But this is a surprising fact with an ingenious proof; it is not the DEFINITION of a boy optimal matching.
