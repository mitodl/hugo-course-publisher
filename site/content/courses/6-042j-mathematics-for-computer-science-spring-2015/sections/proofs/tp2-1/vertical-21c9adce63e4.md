WOP Proof for Geometric Sum
---------------------------

  

In Well Ordering Proofs, first we assume that there is a nonempty set \\(C\\) of counterexamples and that \\(m\\) is the smallest element of \\(C\\). Then we reach a contradiction.

What was the contradiction in the proof for the closed expression of the sum of a geometric series?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;it holds for mit does not hold for m=1 the indices did not match upm was not the smallest element of C it holds for m&nbsp;
