transcript: >-
  <p><span m='0'>PROFESSOR: This is Mathematics for Computer Science,</span>
  <span m='2530'>6.042J/18.062J, a joint subject between electrical
  engineering</span> <span m='8790'>and computer science and mathematics.</span>
  </p><p><span m='12190'>Welcome.</span> </p><p><span m='13080'>The instructors
  are Professor Adam Chlipala</span> <span m='15830'>and Professor Albert R.
  Meyer.</span> </p><p><span m='18550'>And I'm Albert.</span> </p><p><span
  m='19950'>Hi, ya.</span> </p><p><span m='22840'>Quickly summarizing what this
  course is about,</span> <span m='25320'>it's about the math that computer
  scientists almost all</span> <span m='30340'>need regularly and which you're
  not</span> <span m='33150'>likely to have come across in your standard
  calculus classes.</span> </p><p><span m='37300'>You may have seen some of this
  stuff in high school.</span> </p><p><span m='40190'>For example, in calculus
  courses people</span> <span m='43320'>talk about functions on the real
  numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='45060'>And sometimes, they'll talk about
  functions</span> <span m='46851'>on the complex numbers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='48350'>But computer scientists are usually</span> <span m='50160'>dealing
  with much more abstract functions on data types</span> <span m='53660'>and
  even functions on functions.</span> </p><p><span m='55850'>And I wonder how
  many of you, if I ask you to define abstractly</span> <span m='60160'>what a
  function was, could give that definition.</span> </p><p><span m='62740'>In a
  couple of weeks in this class,</span> <span m='65250'>you'll be able to do
  that with facility.</span> </p><p><span m='69820'>We will also be talking
  about a variety</span> <span m='71960'>of standard discrete structures,
  starting with the numbers which</span> <span m='75560'>we think of as a
  structure, because it's</span> <span m='77250'>the numbers packaged with the
  operations on them,</span> <span m='79680'>like plus and times and
  exponentiation.</span> </p><p><span m='82460'>We'll also talk about various
  other standard data structures,</span> <span m='86410'>like graphs and
  trees.</span> </p><p><span m='88280'>And we'll look at methods for
  counting</span> <span m='92250'>the numbers of these different kinds of data
  structures,</span> <span m='94610'>as a typical fundamental problem in
  computer science, where</span> <span m='98020'>you typically want to know how
  big is the search space.</span> </p><p><span m='100460'>For example, the
  search space of passwords had better be large</span> <span m='104490'>or a
  cracker can just search through them</span> <span m='106509'>all to find one
  that works.</span> </p><p><span m='108340'>And finally, we'll talk about
  discrete probability theory,</span> <span m='112220'>which is simply a version
  of probability theory,</span> <span m='114850'>where we can get by with sums
  instead</span> <span m='117490'>of getting into the complications of
  integrals.</span> </p><p><span m='121560'>So here's a quick sanity check, or
  vocabulary check.</span> </p><p><span m='125500'>Do you know what discrete
  means?</span> </p><p><span m='126990'>And I'll give you a hint.</span>
  </p><p><span m='128031'>It doesn't mean discreet.</span> </p><p><span
  m='129180'>If you don't know, this is a good moment to stop the video</span>
  <span m='132370'>and look it up.</span> </p>
