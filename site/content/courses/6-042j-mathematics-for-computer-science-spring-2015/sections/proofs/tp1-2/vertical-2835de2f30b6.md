Proof by Contradiction
----------------------

  

Proof by contradiction often involves clever application of proven knowledge to arrive at a contradiction. In the example proof of \\(\\sqrt{2} \\)'s irrationality, what is the key underlying assumption? (We will prove this later in the course!)

Exercise 1

&nbsp; \\(\\sqrt{4} \\) is rational. &nbsp;

&nbsp; The product of two odd numbers is odd. &nbsp;

&nbsp; Prime factorization of integers. &nbsp;

&nbsp; None of the above. &nbsp;

One effective way to prove B appeals to C, and either one is fair to consider as our big unproved assumption.
