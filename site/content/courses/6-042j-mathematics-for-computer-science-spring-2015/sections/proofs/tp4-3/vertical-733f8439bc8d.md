Cantor's Diagonal Argument
--------------------------

  

1.  The Diagonal Argument was used to illustrate that the set of infinite binary sequences, \\(\\{ 0, 1 \\} ^ \\omega \\), is \_\_\_\_\_,
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp;countableuncountableneither countable nor uncountable uncountable&nbsp;
    
    by building a \_\_\_\_\_
    
    Exercise 2
    
    &nbsp;finite binary sequenceinfinite binary sequenceEither of the aboveNeither of the above infinite binary sequence&nbsp;
    
    that is \_\_\_\_\_ the list of infinite binary sequences.
    
    Exercise 3
    
    &nbsp;innot in not in&nbsp;
    
2.  The set of natural numbers is strictly smaller than the set, \\(A \\), of infinite binary strings (i.e. \\(\\mathbb{N} \\) strict \\(A \\)), because \_\_\_\_\_.
    
    Exercise 4
    
    &nbsp;there is no surjection from the set of natural numbers to \\(A \\)there is a bijection from the set of natural numbers to \\(A \\)the statement is false! The natural numbers are as large as \\(A \\)there is no injective relation from the set of natural numbers to \\(A \\) there is no surjection from the set of natural numbers to \\(A \\)&nbsp;
    
3.  Cantor's Theorem states that for any set \\(A \\), finite or infinite, \_\_\_\_\_ pow(\\(A \\)).
    
    Exercise 5
    
    &nbsp;\\(A \\) inj\\(A \\) bij\\(A \\) surj\\(A \\) strict \\(A \\) strict&nbsp;
