In- ,Sur-, and Bijections
-------------------------

  

For each of the following real-valued functions on **the real numbers** \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), indicate whether it is a _bijection_, a _surjection but not a bijection_, an _injection but not a bijection_, or _neither an injection nor a surjection_.

1.  \\(x+2\\)
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp;a bijectiona surjection but not a bijectionan injection but not a bijectionneither an injection nor a surjection a bijection&nbsp;
    
2.  \\(2x \\)
    
    Exercise 2
    
    &nbsp;a bijectiona surjection but not a bijectionan injection but not a bijectionneither an injection nor a surjection a bijection&nbsp;
    
3.  \\(x^2 \\)
    
    Exercise 3
    
    &nbsp;a bijectiona surjection but not a bijectionan injection but not a bijectionneither an injection nor a surjection neither an injection nor a surjection&nbsp;
    
    \\(x^2 \\) is not a surjection, since negative numbers could not be squares of real numbers. \\(x^2 \\) also is not an injection, since \\((-1)^2=1^2\\).
    
4.  \\(x^3 \\)
    
    Exercise 4
    
    &nbsp;a bijectiona surjection but not a bijectionan injection but not a bijectionneither an injection nor a surjection a bijection&nbsp;
    
5.  \\(\\sin x \\)
    
    Exercise 5
    
    &nbsp;a bijectiona surjection but not a bijectionan injection but not a bijectionneither an injection nor a surjection neither an injection nor a surjection&nbsp;
    
    \\(\\sin x \\) is not a surjection, since \\(-1 \\leq \\sin x \\leq 1 \\). \\(\\sin x \\) is not an injection, since \\(\\sin 0 = \\sin 2\\pi \\).
    
6.  \\(x \\sin x \\)
    
    Exercise 6
    
    &nbsp;a bijectiona surjection but not a bijectionan injection but not a bijectionneither an injection nor a surjection a surjection but not a bijection&nbsp;
    
    \\(x \\sin x \\) is not an injection, since \\(0 \\sin 0 = 2\\pi \\sin 2 \\pi \\).
    
7.  \\(e^x \\)
    
    Exercise 7
    
    &nbsp;a bijectiona surjection but not a bijectionan injection but not a bijectionneither an injection nor a surjection an injection but not a bijection&nbsp;
    
    \\(e^x \\) is not a surjection, since \\(e^x \\) is always positive for real values of \\(x \\).
