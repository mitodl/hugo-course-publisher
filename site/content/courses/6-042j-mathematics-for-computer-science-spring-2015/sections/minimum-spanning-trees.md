Multiple Choice
---------------

An MST of a graph G is always unique.

Exercise 1

&nbsp;True&nbsp;

&nbsp;False&nbsp;

False. This is only true when the edge weights of G are distinct. Otherwise, consider a complete graph with all edges having equal weights. This graph obviously does not have a unique MST.

Which of following statements must be true about an MST of a connected graph G with distinct edge weights:

Exercise 2

&nbsp;The MST is unique&nbsp;

&nbsp;The smallest edge is in the MST&nbsp;

&nbsp;The largest edge is not in the MST&nbsp;

&nbsp;None of the above&nbsp;
