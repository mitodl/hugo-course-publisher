RSA Encryption
--------------

  

The value \\(d\\) in an RSA private key is derived from two prime numbers \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) by

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Finding a number that is relatively prime to pqFinding a number that is relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1)Finding the inverse (mod pq) of a number that is relatively prime to pqFinding the inverse (mod (p-1)(q-1)) of a number that is relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1)Finding the inverse (mod pq) of a number that is relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1)Finding the inverse (mod (p-1)(q-1)) of a number that is relatively prime to pq Finding the inverse (mod (p-1)(q-1)) of a number that is relatively prime to (p-1)(q-1)&nbsp;
