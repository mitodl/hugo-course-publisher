Longest Path
------------

Consider some graph that has 10 edges and 16 vertices.

1.  What is the maximum possible length of a _longest path_ in this graph?
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp;Text Response&nbsp; Answer:10
    
    The maximum is obviously 10, because there are 10 edges that can be arranged in a path.
    
2.  What is the minimum possible length of a _longest path_ in this graph?
    
    Exercise 2
    
    &nbsp;Text Response&nbsp; Answer:1

The minimum possible longest path can't be 0, because we have a non-zero number of edges. A graph with edges from the first 10 vertices to the 11th has only length 1 paths. Hence, the minimum longest path is 1.
