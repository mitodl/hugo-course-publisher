What is the chromatic number of the above graph?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Text Response&nbsp; Answer:3

The chromatic number of this graph is 3. First, observe that 3 colors are sufficient. Two colors are enough for the vertices \\((a, b, c, d, e, \\text{ and } f)\\), if we alternate their colors moving in a circle around the figure. A third color can be used for the vertex, \\(g\\), in the center, and this completes the coloring. Second, 3 colors are necessary. This is because the graph contains a triangle (for example, the one formed by \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(g\\)), and any triangle needs 3 colors.
