1.  Which of the following graph features may _NOT_ appear in a digraph:
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp; self loops &nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; isolated nodes (with no edges in or out) &nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; two edges in opposite directions between a pair of nodes &nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; two edges in the same direction between a pair of nodes &nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; having no edges at all &nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; having no nodes at all &nbsp;
    
  
3.  Let \\(V\\) be a DAG and \\(U\\) be the DAG with only the covering edges of \\(V\\). Then,
    
    1.  compared to the length of the _shortest_ path between two nodes in \\(V\\), the length of the _shortest_ path in \\(U\\) between these nodes is:
        
        Exercise 2
        
        &nbsp;the samenot longernot shortermay be shorter or longer not shorter&nbsp;
        
    2.  compared to the length of the _longest_ path between two nodes in \\(V\\), the length of the _longest_ path in \\(U\\) between these nodes is:
        
        Exercise 3
        
        &nbsp;the samenot longernot shortermay be shorter or longer the same&nbsp;
