Counting Cases
--------------

If for a structural induction proof, there are 3 base cases and 4 different constructors, how many cases (i.e. specific \\(P(x)\\)'s) must be considered?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;3&nbsp;

&nbsp;4&nbsp;

&nbsp;7&nbsp;

&nbsp;12&nbsp;

&nbsp;64&nbsp;

&nbsp;81&nbsp;

Explanation

Each of the base cases must be proved, as well as each of the constructors \\(P(c(x))\\), assuming \\(P(x)\\) is true.

3+4 gives 7.
