Perturbation by Young Gauss
---------------------------

  

What perturbation did the nine-year-old C.F. Gauss reportly use to quickly sum 30 integers in increments of 13 starting with 89?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;find the average of the 30 integers and then multiply it by 30subtract a shifted sum from the initial sum to get a massive cancellation of termsadd the sum to itself with the terms in reverse order to get \\(30\\cdot (89+479)\\)apply the closed-form expression for arithmetic sums add the sum to itself with the terms in reverse order to get \\(30\\cdot (89+479)\\)&nbsp;

Choice 1 is a consequence of Gauss' calculation, and choice 4 is derived from it. Choice 2 is the perturbation we use to find a closed form for a geometric sum.
