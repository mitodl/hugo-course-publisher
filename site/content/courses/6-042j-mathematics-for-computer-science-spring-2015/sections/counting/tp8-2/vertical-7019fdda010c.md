Annuities
---------

  

Assuming you could be sure of getting a 4% return forever on the money you invest, what would be a proper amount to invest now for an annuity that would pay you $10,000 yearly forever starting a year from now?

Enter the whole dollar amount without commas or the dollar sign. For example, if you want to invest $140,000.00, you should type 140000.

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

The current value of $10,000 paid out \\(i\\) years from now is \\(\\frac{10,000}{1.04^i}\\). Summing this for \\(i=1,2,\\ldots\\) we get $250,000.

Alternatively, putting $250,000 in the bank today will allow us to collect 0.04\\(\\cdot\\)$250,000 = $10,000 every year, starting a year from now.
