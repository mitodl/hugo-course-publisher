Independent vs. Disjoint
------------------------

  

Can two events be both disjoint and independent?

Exercise 1

&nbsp; Never &nbsp;

&nbsp; Only if the two terms are equivalent &nbsp;

&nbsp; Only if the disjoint events are always independent &nbsp;

&nbsp; Only if at least one event is empty &nbsp;

&nbsp; Only if both events have are empty &nbsp;

&nbsp; Only if at least one event has probability 1 or is empty &nbsp;

&nbsp; Only if both events have probability 1 or is empty &nbsp;

&nbsp; Always &nbsp;

Events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint if \\(A\\cap B=\\emptyset\\) and they are independent if \\(\\Pr\[A\\cap B\]=\\Pr\[A\]\\Pr\[B\]\\). If \\(A\\cap B=\\emptyset\\), then since \\(\\Pr\[\\emptyset\]=0\\), we need either \\(\\Pr\[A\]=0\\) or \\(\\Pr\[B\]=0\\) for them to be independent as well.
