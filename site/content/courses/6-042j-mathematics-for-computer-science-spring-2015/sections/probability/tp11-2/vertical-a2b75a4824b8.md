Fun with Coins
--------------

  
Answer these following questions about flipping a fair coin.

1.  What is the probability that you will throw Tails _forever_ with a fair coin?
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
    
    The probablity that you will throw \\(n\\) Tails in a row is \\((\\frac{1}{2})^n\\). As \\(n\\) approaches infinity, the probability goes to 0.
    
2.  What is the probability that you will throw at least one Head when you keep throwing a fair coin _forever_?
    
    Exercise 2
    
    &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
    
    This event happens exactly when you don't throw Tails forever. Since we know the probability of throwing Tails forever is 0 from the previous part, the probability of at least one Head is 1 - 0 = 1.
