Simplify Prize Tree
-------------------

  

Which of the following arguments simplifies the tree model for the Monty Hall SWITCH strategy?

Exercise 1

&nbsp; The probability values of the outcomes are equal. &nbsp;

&nbsp; Branches after the prize location nodes are symmetric. &nbsp;

&nbsp; The tree branches are of the same size. &nbsp;

&nbsp; The door that conceals the prize and the door that the contestant picks can be condensed into whether the contestant picks the door with the prize. &nbsp;

&nbsp; If the door that conceals the prize is picked initially, the SWITCH strategy leads to losing, independent of which door is opened. &nbsp;

&nbsp; The branches that follow the two nodes where a door concealing a goat is picked, lead to the same outcome with the same probability, so these nodes could be combined. &nbsp;
