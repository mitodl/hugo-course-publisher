Dicey Sum
---------

  

Say I roll two dice and the values of the faces on top add up to 4.

What is the probability that one of them shows a 3? Please answer with a decimal with two significant digits.

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

There are 3 equally likely outcomes where the dice sum to 4: (1,3), (2,2), and (3,1). 2 out of these 3 include a 3, so the conditional probability is 2/3.
