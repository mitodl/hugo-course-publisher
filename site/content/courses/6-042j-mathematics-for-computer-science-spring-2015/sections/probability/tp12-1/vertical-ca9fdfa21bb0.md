Cavities And Candy
------------------

  

Say the probability I have a cavity is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) and the probability I do not have a cavity is \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\). If I have a cavity, then I eat candy with probability \\(\\frac{4}{5}\\). If I do not have a cavity, then I eat candy with probability \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\). Please answer in the form of a decimal with two significant digits.

What is the probability that I will eat candy?

Exercise 1

&nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;

By the Law of total Probability, \\(\\Pr\[\\text{eat candy}\]=\\Pr\[\\text{eat candy}\\;|\\;\\text{have cavity}\]\\cdot \\Pr\[\\text{have cavity}\]\\)\\( + \\Pr\[\\text{eat candy}\\;|\\;\\text{do not have cavity}\]\\cdot \\Pr\[\\text{have cavity}\]\\) \\(= \\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{20}\\)
