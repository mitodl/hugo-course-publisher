Counting Practice
-----------------

  

1.  Suppose for a bank account, you must create a PIN of 5 numbers (0-9). How many possible PINs are there?
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
    
    There are 10 choices for each of the 5 digits of the PIN. By the product rule, this means there are \\(10^5\\) or 100000 possible PINs.
    
  
3.  You can wear a shirt or a tank top, and shorts or pants. You have 3 colors of shirts, 2 colors of tank tops, 4 colors of shorts, and 4 colors of pants. How many different outfits can you make?
    
    Exercise 2
    
    &nbsp;Numerical Response&nbsp;
    
    Using the sum rule, you have 3+2=5 choices of tops and 4+4=8 choices of bottoms. Then using the product rule, we can pair a top and a bottom in 5\\(\\cdot\\)8=40 ways.
