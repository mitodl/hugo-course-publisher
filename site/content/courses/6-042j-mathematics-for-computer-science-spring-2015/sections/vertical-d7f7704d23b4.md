Properties Of Relations
-----------------------

  

Let \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) be relations on the set \\(A\\). Which of the following statements about \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are true?

Exercise 1

&nbsp; If \\(R\\) is reflexive, then the complement of \\(R\\) is also reflexive. &nbsp;

&nbsp; If \\(R\\) is symmetric, then the complement of \\(R\\) is symmetric. &nbsp;

&nbsp; If both \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are reflexive, then \\(R\\cap S\\) is also reflexive. &nbsp;

While \\(\\leq\\) is reflexive, its complement \\(>\\) is not.
