Implications of Expectation
---------------------------

Suppose \\(X\\) is a nonnegative integer random variable for which \\(E\[X\]\\)=5. You know nothing else about \\(X\\).

Complete the following statements so that they are guaranteed to be true.

1.  The probability that \\(X=5\\) is
    
    Exercise 1
    
    &nbsp; positive&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; less than 1&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; at least \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; at most \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; could be 0&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; 1&nbsp;
    
    Two cases disprove all the others: \\(X\\) is always 5 or \\(X\\) is 0 or 10 with equal likelihood.
    
  
3.  With positive probability, \\(X\\) is
    
    Exercise 2
    
    &nbsp; equal to 0&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; at most \\(\\frac{5}{2}\\)&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; less than 5&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; at most 5&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; equal to 5&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; greater than 5&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; at least 10 &nbsp;
    
    If \\(X\\) were always >5, then we would have \\(E\[X\] >\\)5. So, it must be at most 5 with positive probability.
    
    The rest of the options (except equal to 5) are disproved by the following counterexample: Let \\(X\\) be the constant random variable equal to 5. Then \\(E\[X\]\\)=5, and the other statements are obviously false. Equal to 5 is disproved by the random variable that takes values 0 or 10, each with probability \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).
    
  
5.  \\(E\[X^2\]\\)
    
    Exercise 3
    
    &nbsp; is 25&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; is not 25&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; is at most 25&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; is at most \\(E\[X\]\\)&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; could be 0&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; could be 100&nbsp;
    
    \\(X\\) could be 20 with probability \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) and 0 with probability \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\). Then its expectation would be 5, but the expectation of its square would be \\(100=\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot 0^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 20^2\\). In fact, by setting \\(X\\) to be very large with low probability, we can make its expectation arbitrarily large. We can rule out all the other answers:
    
    *   \\(X\\) could be 0 with probability \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) and 10 with probability \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Then the expectation of \\(X^2\\) would be 50. So, the 1st, the third, and the fourth answers are wrong.
    *   \\(X\\) could be 5 with probability 1. Then the expectation of \\(X^2\\) would be 25. So the second answer is wrong.
    *   \\(E\[X^2\]\\) is at least \\(E\[X^2\]\\), since \\(Var\[X\]=E\[X^2\]-E\[X\]^2\\) and Variance is nonnegative, so we know it is not 0.
    
  
7.  The probability \\(\\Pr\[X \\geq 1000\]\\) is
    
    Exercise 4
    
    &nbsp; zero&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; positive&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; at most \\(\\frac{1}{1000}\\)&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; at most \\(\\frac{1}{500}\\)&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; at most \\(\\frac{1}{200}\\)&nbsp;
    
    &nbsp; at most \\(\\Pr\[X \\geq 5\\cdot1000\]\\)&nbsp;
    
    A direct application of Markov's Theorem. Since \\(X\\) is a nonnegative variable, we know that \\\[\\Pr \[X \\geq a\] \\leq \\frac{E\[X\]}{a}\\\] for any \\(a\\). In this case, we have \\\[\\Pr \[X \\geq 1000\] \\leq \\frac{5}{1000} = \\frac{1}{200}\\\] On the other hand, \\(X\\) could be 1000 with probability \\(\\frac{1}{200}\\) and 0 otherwise, in which case the smaller bounds would not hold. Of course if \\(X\\) is always 5, this probability is 0, so it's not necessarily positive.
