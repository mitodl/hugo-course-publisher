When to Prove by Cases
----------------------

  

Based on the video and slides, when might we want to prove by cases?

Exercise 1

&nbsp; The range of the variables in the problem can be broken up into pieces (i.e. cases). &nbsp;

&nbsp; The predicate in each case is easier to prove. &nbsp;

&nbsp; All cases together cover all possibilities, such that proving all individual cases completes the proof. &nbsp;

&nbsp; When a direct proof is infeasible. &nbsp;

Proof by cases might be used when a complicated proof could be broken into cases, where each case is simpler to prove and the cases together cover all possibilities.
