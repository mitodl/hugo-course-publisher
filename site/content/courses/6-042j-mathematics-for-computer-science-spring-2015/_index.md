course_description: >-
  <p>This subject offers an interactive introduction to discrete mathematics
  oriented toward computer science and engineering. The subject coverage divides
  roughly into thirds:</p> <ol>     <li>Fundamental concepts of mathematics:
  Definitions, proofs, sets, functions, relations.</li>     <li>Discrete
  structures: graphs, state machines, modular arithmetic, counting.</li>    
  <li>Discrete probability theory.</li> </ol> <p>On completion of 6.042J,
  students will be able to explain and apply the basic methods of discrete
  (noncontinuous) mathematics in computer science. They will be able to use
  these methods in subsequent courses in the design and analysis of algorithms,
  computability theory, software engineering, and computer
  systems.</p><p>Interactive site components can be found on the Unit pages in
  the left-hand navigational bar, starting with <a
