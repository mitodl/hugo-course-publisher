transcript: >-
  <p><span m='0'>Good morning, OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1000'>Let's get
  started. We have one handout today.</span> </p><p><span m='5000'>That's your
  lecture notes. There's some copies still</span> <span m='10000'>outside for
  those who haven't picked one up.</span> </p><p><span m='14000'>In general,
  what I do is, in the lecture notes,</span> <span m='19000'>I leave out large
  amounts of material.</span> </p><p><span m='22000'>So, this will enable you to
  keep your hands busy while I'm</span> <span m='28000'>lecturing and take down
  some notes and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='34000'>So, don't assume that
  everything that I talk about is</span> <span m='41000'>on here. Please follow
  along.</span> </p><p><span m='44000'>OK, so as is my usual practice, let me
  start with a quick</span> <span m='52000'>review of what we covered so
  far.</span> </p><p><span m='58000'>So what we did primarily was looked at this
  discipline that</span> <span m='63000'>we call the lump matter discipline,
  which was very</span> <span m='67000'>similar, very reminiscent of the point
  mass simplification in</span> <span m='73000'>physics. And this
  discipline,</span> <span m='75000'>this set of constraints we imposed on
  ourselves,</span> <span m='80000'>allowed us to move from Maxwell's equations
  to a very,</span> <span m='85000'>very simple form of algebraic
  equations.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>And specifically, the discipline took
  two forms.</span> </p><p><span m='95000'>One is, we said that we will deal
  with elements for whom the</span> <span m='102000'>rate of change of magnetic
  flux is zero outside of the elements,</span> <span m='110000'>and for whom the
  rate of change of charge I want to charge</span> <span m='117000'>inside the
  element was zero. So, if I took any element,</span> <span m='123000'>any
  element that I called a lump circuit element,</span> <span m='127000'>like a
  resistor or a voltage source, and I put a black box</span> <span
  m='131000'>around it, then what I'm saying is that the net charge
  inside</span> <span m='135000'>that is going to be zero. And this is not true
  in</span> <span m='138000'>general. We will see examples where,</span> <span
  m='140000'>if you choose some piece of an element for example,</span> <span
  m='144000'>there might be charge buildup, but net inside the,</span> <span
  m='147000'>if I put a box around the entire element,</span> <span m='150000'>I
  am going to assume that the rate of change of charge is</span> <span
  m='154000'>going to be zero. So, what this did was it</span> <span
  m='159000'>enabled us to create the lump circuit abstraction,</span> <span
  m='164000'>where I could take elements, some element of the sort,</span> <span
  m='169000'>this could be a resistor, a voltage source,</span> <span
  m='174000'>or whatever, and I could now ascribe a</span> <span
  m='177000'>voltage, some voltage across an element, and also some
  current,</span> <span m='184000'>"i," that was going into the element.</span>
  </p><p><span m='189000'>And as I go forward, when I label the voltages
  and</span> <span m='192000'>currents across and through elements, I'm going to
  be</span> <span m='196000'>following a convention. OK, the convention is that
  I'm</span> <span m='201000'>going to label, if I label V in the
  following</span> <span m='204000'>manner, then I'm going to label "i" for that
  element as a</span> <span m='208000'>current flowing into the positive
  terminal.</span> </p><p><span m='213000'>It's just a convention. By doing
  this,</span> <span m='216000'>it turns out that the power consumed by the
  element is "vi"</span> <span m='220000'>is positive. OK, so by choosing I
  going in</span> <span m='224000'>this way into the positive terminal, the
  power consumed by</span> <span m='228000'>the element is going to be
  positive.</span> </p><p><span m='231000'>OK, so in general of even simply
  following this</span> <span m='235000'>convention, when I label voltages and
  currents,</span> <span m='239000'>I'll be labeling the current into an element
  entering in</span> <span m='243000'>through the plus terminal. Remember, of
  course,</span> <span m='248000'>if the current is going this way, let's have
  one amp of</span> <span m='252000'>current flowing this way, then when I
  compute the</span> <span m='255000'>current, "i" will come out to be
  negative.</span> </p><p><span m='258000'>OK, so by making these assumptions,
  the assumptions of</span> <span m='262000'>the lumped matter discipline, I
  said I was able to simplify</span> <span m='266000'>my life tremendously. And,
  in particular what it did</span> <span m='271000'>was it allowed me to take
  Maxwell's equations,</span> <span m='276000'>OK, and simplify them into a very
  simple algebraic form,</span> <span m='281000'>which has both a voltage law
  and a current law that I call</span> <span m='286000'>Kirchhoff's voltage law,
  and Kirchhoff's current law.</span> </p><p><span m='291000'>KVL simply states
  that if I have some circuit,</span> <span m='295000'>and if I measured the
  voltages in any loop in the circuit,</span> <span m='301000'>so if I look at
  the voltages in any loop, then the voltages in</span> <span m='307000'>the
  loop would sum to zero. OK, so I measure voltages in</span> <span
  m='313000'>the loop, and they will sum to zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='316000'>Similarly, for the current, if I take a node of a circuit,</span>
  <span m='321000'>if I build the circuit, a node is a point in the</span> <span
  m='325000'>circuit where multiple edges connect.</span> </p><p><span
  m='329000'>If I take a node, then the current coming into</span> <span
  m='332000'>that node, the net current coming into a node is going to</span>
  <span m='337000'>be zero. OK, so if I take any node of</span> <span
  m='340000'>the circuit and sum up all the currents going into that
  node,</span> <span m='345000'>they will all net sum to zero. So, notice what
  I've done is by</span> <span m='351000'>this discipline, by this constraint I
  imposed on</span> <span m='355000'>myself, I was able to make this incredible
  leap from Maxwell's</span> <span m='360000'>equations to these really, really
  simple algebraic</span> <span m='364000'>equations, KVL and KCL. And I promise
  you,</span> <span m='369000'>going forward to the rest of 6.002, if this is
  all you know,</span> <span m='373000'>you can pretty much solve any circuit
  using these two very</span> <span m='378000'>simple relations. It's actually
  really,</span> <span m='380000'>really simple. It's all very simple
  algebra,</span> <span m='384000'>OK? So, just to show you an</span> <span
  m='386000'>example, let me do a little demonstration.</span> </p><p><span
  m='389000'>Let me build let me build a small circuit and measure some</span>
  <span m='393000'>voltages for you, and show you that the voltages,</span>
  <span m='397000'>indeed, add up to zero. So, here's my little circuit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='445000'>So, I'm going to show you a simple circuit that looks
  like</span> <span m='449000'>this, and let's go ahead and measure some
  voltages and</span> <span m='453000'>currents. In terms of terminology
  to</span> <span m='455000'>remember, this is called a loop. So if I start from
  the point C</span> <span m='460000'>and I travel through the voltage source,
  come to the node A down</span> <span m='465000'>through R1 and all the way
  down through R2 back to C,</span> <span m='469000'>that's a loop. Similarly,
  this point A is a</span> <span m='472000'>node where resistor R1 the voltage
  source V0,</span> <span m='475000'>and R4 are connected. OK, just make sure
  your</span> <span m='478000'>terminology is correct. So, what I'll do is I'll
  make</span> <span m='484000'>some quick measurements for you, and show you
  that these KVL and</span> <span m='490000'>KCL are indeed true. So, the
  circuits up there,</span> <span m='494000'>could I have a volunteer? Any
  volunteer?</span> </p><p><span m='498000'>All you have to do is write things
  on the board.</span> </p><p><span m='502000'>Come on over. OK, so let me take
  some</span> <span m='506000'>measurements, and why don't you write down</span>
  <span m='510000'>what I measure on the board? What I'll do is,</span> <span
  m='515000'>let me borrow another piece of chalk here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='519000'>What I'll do is focus on this loop here, and focus on this</span>
  <span m='525000'>node and make some measurements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='540000'>All right, so you see the circuit up there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='545000'>OK, so I get 3 volts for the voltage from C to A.</span>
  </p><p><span m='551000'>so why don't you write down 3 volts?</span>
  </p><p><span m='570000'>OK, so the next one is -1.6. And so that will
  be,</span> <span m='584000'>I'm doing AB, V_AB.</span> </p><p><span
  m='590000'>OK, and then let me do the last one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='601000'>It is -1.37. The measurements,</span> <span m='608000'>I guess,
  have been this way. So, what's written is V_AC.</span> </p><p><span
  m='614000'>But it's OK for now. Don't worry about it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='618000'>So, well, thank you. I appreciate your help here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='623000'>OK, so within the bonds of experimental error,</span>
  <span m='627000'>noticed that if I add up these three voltages,</span> <span
  m='632000'>they nicely sum up to zero. OK, next let me focus on this</span>
  <span m='638000'>node here. And at this node,</span> <span m='641000'>let me
  go ahead and measure some currents.</span> </p><p><span m='644000'>What I'll
  do now is change to an AC voltage so that I can go</span> <span
  m='650000'>ahead and measure the current without breaking my circuit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='655000'>OK, this time around, you'll get to see the</span>
  <span m='659000'>measurements that I'm taking as well.</span> </p><p><span
  m='664000'>So, what I have here, I guess you can see it this</span> <span
  m='669000'>way. What I have here is three wires</span> <span m='674000'>that I
  have pulled out from D. And this is the node D,</span> <span m='680000'>OK?
  So, I have three wires coming</span> <span m='684000'>into the node D just to
  make it a little bit easier for me to</span> <span m='692000'>measure stuff.
  OK, so everybody keep your</span> <span m='697000'>fingers crossed so I don't
  look like a fool here.</span> </p><p><span m='702000'>I hope this works out.
  So, you roughly get,</span> <span m='706000'>what's that, 10 mV.</span>
  </p><p><span m='708000'>OK, so it's about 10 mV peak to peak out there,</span>
  <span m='713000'>and let's say that if the waveform raises on the
  left-hand</span> <span m='719000'>side, it's positive. So, it's positive 10
  mV.</span> </p><p><span m='725000'>And another positive 10 mV, so that's 20
  mV.</span> </p><p><span m='728000'>And this time, it's a negative,</span>
  <span m='731000'>roughly 20, I guess, -20.</span> </p><p><span m='733000'>So,
  I'm getting, in terms of currents,</span> <span m='737000'>I have a -10, -10,
  I'm sorry,</span> <span m='739000'>positive 10, positive 10,</span> <span
  m='742000'>and a -20 that adds up to zero. But more interestingly,</span>
  <span m='747000'>I can show you the same thing by holding this current</span>
  <span m='751000'>measuring probe directly across the node.</span> </p><p><span
  m='757000'>And, notice that the net current that is entering into</span> <span
  m='763000'>this node here is zero. OK, so that should just show</span> <span
  m='769000'>you that KCL does indeed hold in practice, and it is not just
  a</span> <span m='776000'>figment of our imaginations. So, before I go
  on,</span> <span m='782000'>I wanted to point one other thing out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='785000'>Notice that I've written down two assumptions of the
  lumped</span> <span m='789000'>matter discipline, OK?</span> </p><p><span
  m='791000'>There is a total assumption of the lump matter discipline,</span>
  <span m='796000'>and that assumption is, in spirit, at least,</span> <span
  m='799000'>shared by the point mass simplification in physics as</span> <span
  m='803000'>well. Can someone tell me what that</span> <span
  m='806000'>assumption is? A total assumption,</span> <span m='808000'>which I
  did not mention, which you can read in your</span> <span m='812000'>notes in
  section 8.2 in the appendix, what's a total</span> <span m='816000'>assumption
  that is shared in spirit with the point mass</span> <span
  m='821000'>simplification? Anybody?</span> </p><p><span m='824000'>A total
  assumption to be made here is that in all the signals</span> <span
  m='829000'>that we will study in this course, we've made the</span> <span
  m='833000'>assumption that the signal speeds of interest,</span> <span
  m='837000'>transition speeds, and so on, are much slower than</span> <span
  m='841000'>the speed of light. OK, that my signal transition</span> <span
  m='845000'>speeds of interest are much slower than the speed of light.</span>
  </p><p><span m='851000'>Remember, the laws of motion, the discrete laws of
  motion</span> <span m='854000'>break down if your objects begin moving at the
  speed of light.</span> </p><p><span m='858000'>OK, the same token here, our
  lump circuit abstraction</span> <span m='862000'>breaks down if we approach
  the speed of light.</span> </p><p><span m='864000'>And there are follow on
  courses that talk about waveguides and</span> <span m='868000'>other
  distributed analysis techniques that deal with</span> <span m='872000'>signals
  that travel close to speeds of light.</span> </p><p><span m='876000'>OK, so
  with that, let me go on to talking about</span> <span m='881000'>method one of
  circuit analysis. This is called the basic KVL</span> <span m='888000'>KCL
  method. So just based on those two</span> <span m='893000'>simple algebraic
  relations, I can analyze very interesting</span> <span m='900000'>and
  complicated circuits. The method goes as follows.</span> </p><p><span
  m='905000'>So, let's say our goal is, given a circuit like this,</span> <span
  m='909000'>our goal is to solve it. OK, in this course,</span> <span
  m='912000'>we will do two kinds of things: analysis and synthesis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='915000'>Analysis says, given a circuit,</span> <span
  m='917000'>OK, what can you tell me about the circuit?</span> </p><p><span
  m='920000'>OK, so we'll solve existing circuits for all the voltages</span>
  <span m='924000'>and currents, voltages across elements,</span> <span
  m='926000'>and currents through those elements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='930000'>Synthesis says, given a function,</span> <span m='932000'>I may ask
  you to go and build circuits.</span> </p><p><span m='935000'>OK, so for
  analysis here, we can apply this method that I</span> <span m='940000'>want to
  show you. And the idea here is that,</span> <span m='944000'>given a circuit
  like this, let us figure out all the</span> <span m='948000'>voltages and
  currents that are a function of the way these</span> <span m='953000'>elements
  are connected. So, the basic KVL and KCL</span> <span m='957000'>method has
  the following steps. The first step is to write down</span> <span
  m='962000'>the element VI relationships. OK, right down the element VI</span>
  <span m='968000'>relationships for all the elements.</span> </p><p><span
  m='970000'>The second step is write KCL for all the nodes,</span> <span
  m='974000'>and the third step is to write KVL for all the loops in the</span>
  <span m='979000'>circuit. That's it.</span> </p><p><span m='980000'>Just go
  ahead and write down element rules,</span> <span m='983000'>KVL, and KCL, and
  then go ahead and solve the</span> <span m='987000'>circuit. So, what we'll
  do,</span> <span m='989000'>we'll do an example, of course.</span>
  </p><p><span m='993000'>But, just as a refresher, we've looked at a bunch
  of</span> <span m='999000'>elements so far, and for the resistor,</span> <span
  m='1003000'>the element relation says that V is pi R, where R is the</span>
  <span m='1010000'>resistance of the element here. For a voltage source,</span>
  <span m='1016000'>V is equal to V nought. That's the element</span> <span
  m='1021000'>relationship. And for a current source,</span> <span
  m='1026000'>the element is the relation is, "i" is simply the current</span>
  <span m='1032000'>flowing through the element. OK, so these are some of
  the</span> <span m='1039000'>simple element rules for the devices that the
  current source,</span> <span m='1045000'>voltage source, and the
  resistor.</span> </p><p><span m='1050000'>So let's go ahead and solve this
  simple circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='1054000'>And what I'll do is go ahead
  and solve the circuit for you.</span> </p><p><span m='1060000'>OK, if you turn
  to page five of your notes, I'm going to go</span> <span m='1066000'>ahead and
  edit the circuit here. You can scribble the values on</span> <span
  m='1073000'>your notes on page five. OK, so as a first step of my</span> <span
  m='1078000'>KVL KCL method, I need to write down all my</span> <span
  m='1083000'>element VI relationships. So, before I do that,</span> <span
  m='1088000'>let me go ahead and label all the voltages and currents
  that</span> <span m='1093000'>are unknowns in the circuit. So, let me label
  the voltages</span> <span m='1097000'>and currents associated with the voltage
  source as here.</span> </p><p><span m='1102000'>Notice, I continue to follow
  this convention where whenever I</span> <span m='1106000'>label voltages and
  currents for an element, I will show the</span> <span m='1111000'>current
  going into the positive terminal of the element</span> <span
  m='1115000'>variable, OK, after element variable voltage.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1120000'>So here, I have V nought and I nought.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1122000'>Let me pause here for five seconds and show you a point of</span>
  <span m='1127000'>confusion that happens sometimes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1129000'>Often times, people confuse between what is</span> <span
  m='1133000'>called the variable that is associated with the element</span>
  <span m='1137000'>versus the element value. OK, notice that here,</span> <span
  m='1141000'>capital V nought is the voltage that this voltage source</span>
  <span m='1147000'>provides, while this name here, v nought, is simply a
  variable</span> <span m='1152000'>that we've used to label the voltage across
  that element.</span> </p><p><span m='1157000'>So, similarly, I can label v1 as
  the voltage</span> <span m='1161000'>across the resistor, and i1 is the
  current flowing</span> <span m='1166000'>through the resistor. So this method
  of labeling,</span> <span m='1170000'>where I follow the convention, that the
  current flows into the</span> <span m='1176000'>positive terminal is called
  the associated variables discipline.</span> </p><p><span m='1184000'>I was
  trying to use the word discipline in situations where</span> <span
  m='1188000'>you have a choice, OK, and of a variety of</span> <span
  m='1190000'>possible choices, you pick one as the convention.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1194000'>OK, so here, as a convention,</span> <span
  m='1196000'>we use the associated variables discipline, and use that
  method</span> <span m='1200000'>to consistently label the unknown voltages and
  currents in</span> <span m='1204000'>our circuits. OK, so let me continue
  the</span> <span m='1209000'>labeling here, v4, i4, i3, v3 here,</span> <span
  m='1213000'>and v2 and i2, v5, and i5.</span> </p><p><span m='1216000'>I think
  that's it. So, I've gone ahead and labeled</span> <span m='1222000'>all my
  unknowns. So each of these voltages and</span> <span m='1227000'>currents are
  the voltages and currents associated with each of</span> <span m='1235000'>the
  elements. And my goal is to solve for</span> <span m='1240000'>these. OK, so
  in terms of our solution</span> <span m='1244000'>here, let's follow the
  method that I outlined for you.</span> </p><p><span m='1249000'>So, as the
  first step I am simply going to go ahead and</span> <span m='1254000'>write
  down all the element VI relationships.</span> </p><p><span m='1260000'>OK, so
  as a first step, I'm going to go ahead and write</span> <span m='1265000'>down
  all the VI relationships. So, can someone yell out for me</span> <span
  m='1272000'>the VI relationship for the voltage source?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1276000'>OK, good. So, v0 is capital V nought,</span> <span
  m='1280000'>that is that the variable V nought is simply equal to the</span>
  <span m='1285000'>voltage, v0. Similarly, I can write the</span> <span
  m='1289000'>others. v1 is i1, R1.</span> </p><p><span m='1292000'>v2 is i2,
  R2, and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='1296000'>OK, and I have one, two, three,
  four,</span> <span m='1299000'>five, six elements. So, I will get six
  such</span> <span m='1304000'>equations. Step two, I'm going to go
  ahead</span> <span m='1308000'>and write KCL for the nodes in my
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='1312000'>So, let me start with node A. So, for
  node A,</span> <span m='1317000'>let me take as positive the currents going
  out of the node.</span> </p><p><span m='1325000'>So, I get i nought flowing
  out, plus i1 flowing out,</span> <span m='1330000'>plus i4 flowing out, and
  they must sum to zero for</span> <span m='1336000'>node A. Then, I can go
  ahead and do the</span> <span m='1340000'>other nodes, let's say, for
  example,</span> <span m='1344000'>I do node B. For node B, I have i2
  going</span> <span m='1348000'>out. That's positive,</span> <span
  m='1351000'>i3, and i1 is coming in, so I get -i1 equals zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1356000'>OK, so I have one, two, three, four,</span> <span
  m='1359000'>I have four nodes. OK, so I would get four</span> <span
  m='1364000'>equations. It turns out that the fourth</span> <span
  m='1367000'>equation is not independent. You can derive it from the</span>
  <span m='1373000'>others. So, I get three independent</span> <span
  m='1376000'>equations out of this. I can then write KVL.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1381000'>And for KVL, I just go down my loops here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1385000'>And let me go through this first loop here in this manner.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1390000'>OK, and a simple trick that I use, you have to be
  incredibly</span> <span m='1395000'>careful when you go through this in
  keeping your minuses and</span> <span m='1400000'>pluses correct. Otherwise
  you can get</span> <span m='1403000'>hopelessly muddled. Once you label
  it,</span> <span m='1406000'>you need to be sure that you get all your minuses
  and pluses</span> <span m='1412000'>correct. So, for KVL,</span> <span
  m='1414000'>what I'd like to do is, let's say I start at C,</span> <span
  m='1418000'>and from C I'm going to go to A.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1420000'>For A I go to B, and from B I'm going to come</span> <span
  m='1424000'>back to C. OK, that's how I traverse my</span> <span
  m='1426000'>loop. And, the trick that I'm going</span> <span m='1429000'>to
  follow is, as my finger walks through that</span> <span m='1432000'>loop, I'm
  going to label the voltage as the first sign that I</span> <span
  m='1437000'>see for that voltage. OK, so I'm going to start with</span> <span
  m='1442000'>C, and I go up. I start by punching into the</span> <span
  m='1445000'>voltage source element, and then punch into it,</span> <span
  m='1448000'>I hit the minus sign for the V nought.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1450000'>OK, so I'm just going to write down minus V nought,</span> <span
  m='1454000'>plus then I go through and as I come up to A and go down to
  B,</span> <span m='1458000'>I punch to the plus sign of the V1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1461000'>So, that's plus V1. And then I punch into the
  plus</span> <span m='1464000'>sign of the V2, and so I get plus V2,</span>
  <span m='1466000'>and that is zero. OK, good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1470000'>So, that matches what you have in your notes as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1473000'>So, this is the first equation. Similarly, I can go
  through my</span> <span m='1476000'>other loops and write down equations for
  each of the loops.</span> </p><p><span m='1480000'>OK, and the convention that
  I like to follow is as I go</span> <span m='1483000'>through the loop, I write
  down as a sign for the</span> <span m='1485000'>voltage the first sign that I
  counter for that element.</span> </p><p><span m='1489000'>OK, you can do the
  exact opposite, if you want,</span> <span m='1491000'>just to be different.
  But, as long as you stay</span> <span m='1494000'>consistent, you'll be OK.
  All right, so in the same</span> <span m='1497000'>manner here, there are four
  loops that I can have,</span> <span m='1500000'>so four equations. Again, one
  of them turns out to</span> <span m='1503000'>be dependent on the others. So I
  end up getting three</span> <span m='1508000'>independent equations. So, I get
  a total of 12</span> <span m='1512000'>equations. I get 12 equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1515000'>There are six elements, OK, voltage source,</span>
  <span m='1520000'>and five resistors. So, there are six unknown</span> <span
  m='1524000'>voltages, and six unknown currents.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1527000'>So, I have 12 equations, and 12 unknowns.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1533000'>OK, I can take all of the equations and put them through a</span>
  <span m='1538000'>big crank, and sit there and grind.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1542000'>And if I was really cruel, I'd give this as a homework</span>
  <span m='1547000'>problem, and have you grind, and grind, and grind until
  you</span> <span m='1553000'>get your six voltages and six currents.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1557000'>OK, it works. OK, so you get 12 equations,</span>
  <span m='1561000'>and this method just works. However, notice that this
  is</span> <span m='1567000'>quite a grubby method. It's quite grungy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1570000'>I get 12 equations, and it's quite a pain even
  for</span> <span m='1574000'>a simple circuit like this. However, suffice it
  to say that</span> <span m='1578000'>this fundamental method is one step away
  from Maxwell's</span> <span m='1582000'>equations, simply works. OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1585000'>So what you'll do is the rest of this lecture,</span>
  <span m='1588000'>I'll introduce you to a couple more methods.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1593000'>One is an intuitive method, and another one called
  the node</span> <span m='1600000'>method is a little bit more formal, but is
  much more,</span> <span m='1606000'>I guess, terse Than the KVL KCL
  method.</span> </p><p><span m='1611000'>Method 2. So the relevant section to
  read</span> <span m='1616000'>in the course notes is section</span> <span
  m='1622000'>One of the things that I will be stressing this semester is</span>
  <span m='1626000'>intuition. What you'll find is that as you</span> <span
  m='1628000'>become EECS majors, and so on, and go on,</span> <span
  m='1631000'>or if you talk to your TAs or your professors and so on,</span>
  <span m='1635000'>you will find that very rarely do they actually go ahead
  and</span> <span m='1639000'>apply the formal methods of analysis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1641000'>OK, by and large, engineers are able to look at
  a</span> <span m='1645000'>circuit and simply by observation write down
  an</span> <span m='1648000'>answer. And usually in the past,</span> <span
  m='1651000'>what we have tried to do is kind of ignore that process and</span>
  <span m='1655000'>told our students, look, we teach you all the</span> <span
  m='1657000'>formal methods, and you will develop your own</span> <span
  m='1660000'>intuition and be able to do it. What we'll try to do this
  term</span> <span m='1664000'>is try to stress the intuitive methods, and try
  to show you how</span> <span m='1667000'>the intuitive process goes, so you
  can very quickly solve</span> <span m='1671000'>many of these circuits simply
  by inspection.</span> </p><p><span m='1674000'>OK, so this method that I'm
  going to show you here is one</span> <span m='1677000'>such an intuitive
  method. And I'll call it element</span> <span m='1682000'>combination tools.
  OK, for many simple circuits,</span> <span m='1688000'>you can solve them very
  quickly by applying this method.</span> </p><p><span m='1694000'>The
  components of this method are these.</span> </p><p><span m='1698000'>I learned
  about how to compose a bunch of elements.</span> </p><p><span m='1704000'>So,
  let's say, for example,</span> <span m='1707000'>I have a set of resistors, R1
  through RN,</span> <span m='1712000'>in series. OK, you can use KVL and KCL
  to</span> <span m='1718000'>show that this is equivalent to a single resistor
  whose value is</span> <span m='1724000'>given by the sum of the
  resistances.</span> </p><p><span m='1728000'>OK, so if I have resistors in
  series, then effectively it's</span> <span m='1734000'>the same as if there
  was a single resistor whose value is</span> <span m='1739000'>the sum of all
  the resistances. OK, you can look at the course</span> <span m='1747000'>notes
  for a proof for derivation of this fact.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1751000'>Similarly, if I have resistances in parallel,</span> <span
  m='1756000'>so let me call them conductances.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1760000'>A conductance is the reciprocal of a resistance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1764000'>If resistance is measured in ohms, conductance is
  measured in</span> <span m='1771000'>mhos, M-H-O-S. OK, so that's the
  conductance</span> <span m='1776000'>is G1, G2, and G3. And
  effectively,</span> <span m='1779000'>this is the same as having a single
  conductance whose</span> <span m='1784000'>effective value is given by the sum
  of the conductances.</span> </p><p><span m='1789000'>OK, the conductances in
  parallel add,</span> <span m='1793000'>and resistances in series add.
  Similarly, for voltage sources,</span> <span m='1800000'>if I have voltage
  sources in series, then they are tantamount</span> <span m='1806000'>to the
  sum of the voltages. And similarly,</span> <span m='1810000'>for currents, if
  I have currents in parallel,</span> <span m='1814000'>then they can be viewed
  as a single current source,</span> <span m='1819000'>whose currents are the
  sum of the individual parallel</span> <span m='1824000'>currents. So, let's do
  a quick example.</span> </p><p><span m='1830000'>So let's do this example. So,
  let's say I have a circuit</span> <span m='1836000'>that looks like this, and
  three resistances.</span> </p><p><span m='1841000'>And let's say all I care
  about is the current,</span> <span m='1847000'>I, that flows through this
  wire.</span> </p><p><span m='1850000'>All I care about is that current.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1854000'>Of course, you can go ahead and write KVL and
  KCL.</span> </p><p><span m='1862000'>You will get four equations, and there
  are four unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='1866000'>And you can solve it. But,
  I can apply my element</span> <span m='1869000'>combination rules, and very
  quickly figure out</span> <span m='1872000'>what the current I is, using the
  following technique.</span> </p><p><span m='1876000'>So, what I can do is, I
  can, first of all,</span> <span m='1879000'>take this circuit. And, I can
  compose these two</span> <span m='1883000'>resistances and show that the
  circuit is equivalent as far as</span> <span m='1887000'>this current, I, is
  concerned to the</span> <span m='1890000'>following circuit, R1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1893000'>And I take the sum of the two conductances,</span>
  <span m='1899000'>OK, and that comes out to be R1, R2, R3, R2 plus R3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1906000'>And then, I can further simplify it, and I get a
  single</span> <span m='1914000'>resistance, whose value is given by R1 plus
  R2,</span> <span m='1921000'>R3, R3. OK, I'm just simplifying the</span> <span
  m='1926000'>circuit. Now, from this circuit,</span> <span m='1928000'>I can
  get the answer that I need.</span> </p><p><span m='1931000'>I is simply the
  voltage, V, divided by R1 plus.</span> </p><p><span m='1935000'>OK, so in
  situations like this where I'm looking for a single</span> <span
  m='1940000'>current, I can very quickly get to the answer by applying
  some</span> <span m='1945000'>of these element combination rules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1948000'>And, I can get rid of having to go through formal
  steps.</span> </p><p><span m='1954000'>So, in general, whenever you encounter
  a</span> <span m='1956000'>circuit, by and large attempt to use intuitive
  methods to solve</span> <span m='1961000'>it. And go to a formal method
  only</span> <span m='1963000'>if some intuitive method fails. Even in your
  homework,</span> <span m='1967000'>by and large, the homeworks are not meant
  to</span> <span m='1971000'>be grungy. OK, if you find a lot of grunge</span>
  <span m='1974000'>in your homework, just remember you're probably</span> <span
  m='1977000'>not using some intuitive method. OK, so just be cautious.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1984000'>All right, so let me go on to the third method of
  circuit</span> <span m='1991000'>analysis, and the third method is called the
  node method.</span> </p><p><span m='1999000'>So, the node method is simply a
  specific application of the KVL</span> <span m='2008000'>KCL method and
  results in a much, much more compact form of</span> <span m='2016000'>the
  final equations. If there's one method that you</span> <span m='2022000'>have
  to remember for life, then I would say just remember</span> <span
  m='2026000'>this method. OK, the node method is a</span> <span
  m='2028000'>workhorse of the easiest industry.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2030000'>OK, if there's one method that you want to consistently
  apply,</span> <span m='2035000'>then this is the one to remember.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2038000'>So, let me quickly outline for you to method,</span>
  <span m='2041000'>and then work out an example for you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2044000'>The first step of the node method will be to select a</span> <span
  m='2049000'>reference or a ground node. This is the symbol for a ground</span>
  <span m='2054000'>node. The ground node simply says</span> <span
  m='2056000'>that I'm going to denote voltages at that point to be</span> <span
  m='2061000'>zero, and measure all my other voltages with reference to
  that</span> <span m='2066000'>point. So, I'm going to select a</span> <span
  m='2070000'>ground node in my circuit. Second, I want to label the</span>
  <span m='2076000'>remaining voltages with respect to the ground node.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2081000'>So, label voltages for all the other nodes with
  respect to the</span> <span m='2088000'>ground node. Next, write KCL for each
  of the</span> <span m='2092000'>nodes write KCL. OK, but don't write KCL for
  the</span> <span m='2097000'>ground node. Remember, if you have N
  nodes,</span> <span m='2102000'>the node equations will give you N-1
  independent equations.</span> </p><p><span m='2107000'>So, write KCL for the
  nodes, but don't do so for the ground</span> <span m='2112000'>node. Then,
  solve for the node</span> <span m='2115000'>voltages. So, let's say when we
  label</span> <span m='2118000'>voltages. I want to be labeling them as
  E</span> <span m='2121000'>something or the other. So, solve for the unknown
  node</span> <span m='2126000'>voltages. And then, once I know all the</span>
  <span m='2131000'>voltages associated with the nodes, I can then back solve
  for</span> <span m='2137000'>all the branch voltages and currents.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2141000'>OK, once I know all the node voltages, I can then go
  ahead</span> <span m='2147000'>and figure out all the branch voltages and the
  branch</span> <span m='2152000'>currents. So, let's go ahead and apply</span>
  <span m='2156000'>this method, and work out an example.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2162000'>Again, remember, if there's one method that you</span> <span
  m='2165000'>should remember, it's the node method.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2168000'>OK, and when in doubt, consistently apply the node</span> <span
  m='2171000'>method and it will work whether your circuit is linear or</span>
  <span m='2175000'>nonlinear, if the resistors are built in the US or the USSR
  it</span> <span m='2180000'>doesn't matter. OK, the node method will
  simply</span> <span m='2183000'>work, linear or nonlinear, OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2186000'>So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to build a
  circuit that's</span> <span m='2190000'>my old faithful. It's our old
  faithful,</span> <span m='2196000'>plus I'll make it a little bit more
  complicated by adding in</span> <span m='2205000'>the current source. So,
  let's go have some fun.</span> </p><p><span m='2212000'>Let's do this. So
  here's my voltage source,</span> <span m='2219000'>as before. OK, what I'll do
  is for fun,</span> <span m='2224000'>add a current source out there. And, you
  can convince</span> <span m='2233000'>yourselves that if you go ahead and
  apply the KVL KCL method,</span> <span m='2240000'>it'll really be a mess of
  equations.</span> </p><p><span m='2245000'>OK, so R1, R3, R4, R2, R5.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2248000'>OK, so let's follow our method and just plug and chug
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2256000'>So let's apply the first step. I select
  a ground node.</span> </p><p><span m='2259000'>It's a reference node from
  which I'll measure all my other</span> <span m='2262000'>voltages. OK, now
  without knowing</span> <span m='2264000'>anything about the node method, try
  to use intuition as to</span> <span m='2268000'>which node you should choose
  as a ground node.</span> </p><p><span m='2271000'>Remember, you want to label
  the ground node with the voltage</span> <span m='2275000'>zero, and measure
  all the other voltages with respect to that</span> <span m='2278000'>node. OK,
  a usual trick is to pick a</span> <span m='2282000'>node which has the largest
  number of elements connected to</span> <span m='2287000'>it as the ground
  node. OK, and in particular,</span> <span m='2291000'>you will find out later
  it's useful to pick a node in which</span> <span m='2296000'>all your voltage
  sources, the maximum number of your</span> <span m='2300000'>voltage sources
  are also connected.</span> </p><p><span m='2303000'>OK, so in this instance,
  I'm going to choose this as my</span> <span m='2307000'>ground node. OK,
  that's my first step.</span> </p><p><span m='2312000'>I chose that as my
  ground node. And I'm going to label that as</span> <span m='2318000'>having a
  voltage zero. Second step,</span> <span m='2321000'>I'll label voltages of the
  other branches with respect to</span> <span m='2327000'>the ground node. OK,
  so what I'll do is add this</span> <span m='2332000'>node here. So I'm going
  to label that</span> <span m='2335000'>voltage E1. These are my
  unknowns.</span> </p><p><span m='2340000'>Remember, node method, because my
  node voltages are my</span> <span m='2345000'>unknowns. So, I label this as
  E1.</span> </p><p><span m='2349000'>I label this one as my unknown voltage,
  E2.</span> </p><p><span m='2354000'>What about this one here? Is that voltage
  unknown?</span> </p><p><span m='2359000'>No. I know what the voltage is</span>
  <span m='2363000'>because I know that this node is at a voltage,</span> <span
  m='2368000'>V0, higher than the ground node.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2373000'>OK, notice that to go from here to here, I directly go through
  a</span> <span m='2378000'>voltage source. And so, this node has
  voltage</span> <span m='2382000'>V0. And I'll simply write down V0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2385000'>OK, try to simplify the number of steps that you have
  to go</span> <span m='2390000'>through, so directly go ahead and write down
  the voltage,</span> <span m='2395000'>V0, for that node. What I will also
  do,</span> <span m='2398000'>is for convenience, I'm going to write
  down,</span> <span m='2402000'>I'm going to use conductances. So I'm going to
  use GI in the</span> <span m='2408000'>place of one by RI, and write down a
  bunch of node</span> <span m='2412000'>equations. OK, so step one,</span>
  <span m='2414000'>I've chosen my ground node. Step two, I've labeled my
  node</span> <span m='2419000'>voltages, E, OK? I've done that with two of
  my</span> <span m='2423000'>steps. Now, let me go ahead and --</span> <span
  m='2441000'>OK, so let me go ahead and apply step three.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2444000'>And, step three says go ahead and apply KCL for each of the</span>
  <span m='2450000'>nodes at which you have an unknown node voltage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2454000'>And then that will give you your equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2459000'>So let me start by applying KCL at E1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2462000'>So, let me write KCL at E1. I do one more
  thing.</span> </p><p><span m='2466000'>Notice, I don't have any currents
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='2469000'>OK, so how do I write KCL? KCL simply
  says the sum of</span> <span m='2474000'>currents into a node is zero again,
  remember,</span> <span m='2478000'>by the lump matter discipline. So, if I
  don't have currents in</span> <span m='2483000'>there, so the trick that I
  adopt is that to write KCL,</span> <span m='2488000'>I use the node voltages,
  and implicitly substitute for</span> <span m='2494000'>the node voltages,
  divide by the elemental the</span> <span m='2497000'>resistance, for instance,
  so I take the node voltages,</span> <span m='2501000'>and divide by the
  resistance, get the current.</span> </p><p><span m='2504000'>OK, so I
  implicitly apply element relationships to get the</span> <span
  m='2508000'>node currents. So, the example that make it</span> <span
  m='2511000'>clear, so I take node E1 and, again, for currents going out</span>
  <span m='2515000'>I'm going to assume to have, to be positive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2520000'>So, the current going up is E1 minus V nought,</span>
  <span m='2525000'>divide by R1, so I multiplied by the G1.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2529000'>That's the current going up. Plus, the current going down
  is</span> <span m='2536000'>E1 minus zero where the ground node potential is
  zero,</span> <span m='2542000'>G2, OK, plus the current that is going to
  resistor R3,</span> <span m='2548000'>which is simply E1 minus E2, divide by
  R3.</span> </p><p><span m='2555000'>So, E1 minus E2, divide by R3,</span>
  <span m='2557000'>or multiplied by G3 is equal to zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2560000'>OK, see how I got this? This is simply KCL,</span> <span
  m='2564000'>but to get my currents, I simply take the differences</span> <span
  m='2569000'>of voltages across elements, and divide by the element of</span>
  <span m='2574000'>resistance, and I get the currents.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2578000'>OK, so I can similarly write KCL at E2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2581000'>So, at KCL at E2, again, let me go outwards.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2586000'>So, the current going up is E2 minus V nought multiplied by
  G4.</span> </p><p><span m='2594000'>The current going left is E2 minus E1
  divided by R3 or</span> <span m='2602000'>multiplied by G3. The current going
  down is E2</span> <span m='2609000'>minus zero multiplied by G5. And, the
  current going down is</span> <span m='2617000'>-I1. OK, you've got to be
  careful</span> <span m='2620000'>with your polarities here. So all the
  currents going out</span> <span m='2626000'>sum to zero. And here are the
  currents that</span> <span m='2630000'>are going out at this point. So what I
  do next is I can move</span> <span m='2636000'>the constant terms to the
  left-hand side and collect my</span> <span m='2641000'>unknowns. So, let me
  write them out here.</span> </p><p><span m='2647000'>So, let's say I get E1
  here, OK, and from this equation,</span> <span m='2654000'>I have a V nought,
  G1, which comes out here.</span> </p><p><span m='2660000'>So, minus V nought
  G1 comes over to the other side.</span> </p><p><span m='2666000'>And, let me
  collect all the values that multiply E1.</span> </p><p><span m='2674000'>So I
  get, G1 is one example. I have G2, and I have G3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2679000'>And then, for E2, I have minus G3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2683000'>OK, so I'll simply express this as the element voltages</span>
  <span m='2689000'>multiplied by some terms in parentheses, and I put my</span>
  <span m='2695000'>external sources on the right hand side.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2699000'>Similarly, I go ahead and do the same thing here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2706000'>In this instance, let me move my sources to
  the</span> <span m='2710000'>right. So, I get I1 coming out there,</span>
  <span m='2713000'>and I get V nought G4 coming out there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2716000'>By the way, I just want to mention to you that if you're</span>
  <span m='2721000'>looking to fall asleep, this is a good time to do so</span>
  <span m='2725000'>because as soon as I write down these two equations,</span>
  <span m='2730000'>OK, from now on it's nap time. There's nothing new that
  you're</span> <span m='2736000'>going to learn from here on. It's just Anant
  Agarwal having</span> <span m='2740000'>fun at the blackboard, pushing symbols
  around.</span> </p><p><span m='2743000'>So, once you write down these two node
  equations,</span> <span m='2746000'>the rest of it is just grubby math.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2748000'>So, let me just have some fun. So let me just go
  ahead and do</span> <span m='2752000'>that. So, I moved my voltages and</span>
  <span m='2754000'>currents to the other side. And let me collect all
  the</span> <span m='2758000'>coefficients for E1 here. So, E1 minus G3,</span>
  <span m='2761000'>and that's it, I guess.</span> </p><p><span m='2764000'>OK,
  and then I'll do the same for E2.</span> </p><p><span m='2768000'>So, I get
  G4, and I get G3,</span> <span m='2772000'>and I get G5. OK, so notice here
  that I have</span> <span m='2778000'>two equations, and two unknowns.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2782000'>OK, the two equations are on the right hand
  side,</span> <span m='2789000'>I have some voltages and currents which are my
  dry</span> <span m='2795000'>voltages and dry currents. OK, so actually this
  is getting</span> <span m='2803000'>quite boring. I'm going to pause
  here,</span> <span m='2806000'>and talk about something else. So, you can take
  this and you</span> <span m='2812000'>can put it in matrix form, so I've done
  that for you on</span> <span m='2816000'>page ten. It's all matrix
  form.</span> </p><p><span m='2820000'>Yeah, I know that. You can use any
  technique to</span> <span m='2823000'>solve it, use algebraic techniques, use
  linear algebraic</span> <span m='2827000'>methods to solve it, use a
  computer,</span> <span m='2829000'>whatever you want. And, computers,</span>
  <span m='2831000'>when computers analyze circuits, they write down
  these</span> <span m='2835000'>equations, and deal with solving
  matrices.</span> </p><p><span m='2838000'>So, when you take the linear algebra
  across,</span> <span m='2841000'>how many people here have taken a linear
  algebra class?</span> </p><p><span m='2845000'>How many people here have heard
  of Gaussian elimination?</span> </p><p><span m='2850000'>How can more people
  have heard of Gaussian elimination than</span> <span m='2854000'>took a linear
  algebra class? Well anyway,</span> <span m='2857000'>so now you know why you
  took those linear algebra classes.</span> </p><p><span m='2862000'>And so, if
  I just collected these into matrix form --</span> <span m='2886000'>OK, so I
  just simply expressed those two equations in linear</span> <span
  m='2889000'>algebraic form, and here's my column vector of</span> <span
  m='2892000'>unknowns, and you can apply any of the techniques you've
  learned</span> <span m='2895000'>in linear algebra to solve for this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2897000'>Gaussian elimination works. OK, and in
  computer,</span> <span m='2900000'>people doing research in computer
  techniques,</span> <span m='2903000'>or solving such equations simply deals
  with huge equations</span> <span m='2906000'>like this, building computer
  programs that,</span> <span m='2908000'>given equations like this, can go
  ahead and solve them.</span> </p><p><span m='2913000'>OK, so let me stop here
  and reemphasize that what you've</span> <span m='2916000'>done is made a huge
  leap from Maxwell's equations to using the</span> <span m='2919000'>lump
  matter discipline to KVL and KCL, which ended up giving a</span> <span
  m='2923000'>simple algebraic equation to solve, and not having to worry</span>
  <span m='2926000'>about partial differential equations that were the form
  of</span> <span m='2929000'>Maxwell's equations.</span> </p>
