title: 'Lecture 4: The Digital Abstraction'
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='0'>So today we are going to talk about another process of
  lumping</span> <span m='1000'>Do you see where the problem</span> <span
  m='2990'>This is my forbidden region</span> <span m='9000'>or another process
  of discretization what will lead to</span> <span m='16000'>the digital
  abstraction. So today's lecture is titled</span> <span m='24000'>"Go Digital".
  So let me begin with a usual</span> <span m='30000'>review. And so in the
  first lecture we</span> <span m='36000'>started out by looking at elements and
  lumping them.</span> </p><p><span m='41000'>For example, we took an element
  and said for</span> <span m='46000'>the purpose of analyzing electrical
  properties let's lump</span> <span m='51000'>this element into a single lumped
  value called a resistor,</span> <span m='57000'>R. And this led to the
  lumped</span> <span m='61000'>circuit abstraction. The lumped circuit
  abstraction</span> <span m='64000'>says let's take these elements, connect
  them with wires and</span> <span m='69000'>analyze the properties of these
  using a sort of analysis</span> <span m='73000'>technique.</span> </p><p><span
  m='82000'>So a set of a methods. We've looked at the KVL,</span> <span
  m='88000'>KCL method. Another example of a method we</span> <span
  m='93000'>looked at was the node method. And of this category there is</span>
  <span m='99000'>one method you should remember, which you can apply to
  every</span> <span m='105000'>single circuit and it will simply work, is the
  node method.</span> </p><p><span m='111000'>For linear circuits other methods
  also apply,</span> <span m='116000'>and these include superposition,</span>
  <span m='119000'>Thevenin method, and in recitation or in your</span> <span
  m='124000'>course notes you would have looked at the Norton method.</span>
  </p><p><span m='132000'>So that's what we did so far. So this is a
  toolkit.</span> </p><p><span m='135000'>So now you have a utility belt with a
  bunch of tools in it,</span> <span m='139000'>and you can draw from those
  tools.</span> </p><p><span m='141000'>And, just like any good carpenter, you
  know,</span> <span m='144000'>the carpenter has to cut a piece of wood.</span>
  </p><p><span m='147000'>He could use a chisel. He could use a saw.</span>
  </p><p><span m='150000'>He could use an electric saw. And the reason you
  pay</span> <span m='154000'>carpenters $80 an hour in the Boston region is
  because they</span> <span m='159000'>know which tool to use for what
  job.</span> </p><p><span m='162000'>So what we'll learn today is, so this was
  one process of</span> <span m='166000'>discretization. We discretized
  matter.</span> </p><p><span m='169000'>This gave us the discipline here that
  we decided to follow,</span> <span m='174000'>lumped matter discipline, that
  moved us from Maxwell's</span> <span m='178000'>equations into this new
  playground called EECS.</span> </p><p><span m='183000'>Where all elements
  looked like these rinky-dinky little values</span> <span m='186000'>like
  resistors and voltage sources and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='189000'>What
  we'll do today, if that wasn't simple enough,</span> <span m='192000'>let's
  simplify our lives even further.</span> </p><p><span m='195000'>What we're
  going to do is lump some more.</span> </p><p><span m='197000'>So what else can
  we lump? We've lumped matter,</span> <span m='200000'>so all matter is taken
  care of. So what can we lump to make</span> <span m='204000'>life even easier?
  When in doubt,</span> <span m='206000'>if things are complicated, discretize
  it or lump it,</span> <span m='209000'>right? So what do you think?</span>
  </p><p><span m='212000'>What we will do today is lump signal values.</span>
  </p><p><span m='225000'>So we'll just deal with lumped values.</span>
  </p><p><span m='227000'>And this will lead to the digital abstraction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='242000'>And the related reading is Chapter 5 of the course
  notes.</span> </p><p><span m='255000'>So before we do this kind of lumping,
  let me motivate why we</span> <span m='259000'>do this. One reason is to
  simplify our</span> <span m='261000'>lives, but there is no need to just go
  around simplifying</span> <span m='265000'>things just because we can. Let's
  try to see if there are</span> <span m='269000'>other reasons motivating the
  digital abstraction.</span> </p><p><span m='274000'>So what I would like to
  start with is a simple example of a</span> <span m='279000'>analog processing
  circuit that you should now be able to</span> <span m='284000'>analyze. So I'm
  going to be motivating</span> <span m='287000'>digital. So let's start with an
  analog</span> <span m='291000'>circuit that looks like this, two
  resistors,</span> <span m='295000'>R1 and R2. And what I'm going to do
  is</span> <span m='300000'>apply a voltage source here, V1, apply another one
  here,</span> <span m='306000'>V2, and make this connection. And let me call
  this voltage V</span> <span m='313000'>nought and call this my output. This
  voltage with respect to</span> <span m='320000'>ground node, rather than
  drawing this wire here,</span> <span m='325000'>I often times draw a ground
  here and simply throw ground</span> <span m='331000'>wherever I want. This
  symbol simply refers to</span> <span m='336000'>the fact that the other
  terminal is taken at the ground node.</span> </p><p><span m='340000'>So here
  is my V nought. Now, let's go and analyze this</span> <span m='344000'>and see
  what it gives us. In this example,</span> <span m='346000'>V1 and V2 may be
  outputs of two sensors, maybe heat sensors or</span> <span
  m='350000'>something like that. This is a heat sensor on that</span> <span
  m='353000'>side of the room and this is a heat sensor on this side of
  the</span> <span m='357000'>room. And I pass their signals</span> <span
  m='361000'>through two resistors and I look at the voltage there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='365000'>So by now you should be able to write the answer V
  nought,</span> <span m='370000'>or the value V nought almost by
  inspection.</span> </p><p><span m='373000'>Just to show you, let me use
  superposition.</span> </p><p><span m='377000'>When you see multiple sources,
  the first thing you should</span> <span m='382000'>think about is can I use
  superposition to simplify my</span> <span m='386000'>life? And let me do
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='390000'>V nought here is the sum of two voltages,
  one due to V1 acting</span> <span m='395000'>alone and one due to V2 acting
  alone.</span> </p><p><span m='398000'>So what's the voltage here due to V1
  acting alone?</span> </p><p><span m='403000'>To find out that I short this
  voltage, I zero out this voltage</span> <span m='408000'>and look at the
  effect of V1. So the effect of V1,</span> <span m='412000'>if this were
  shorted out, is simply V1 x R2 / R1 + R2.</span> </p><p><span m='417000'>This
  is now a voltage divider, right?</span> </p><p><span m='422000'>A voltage V
  applied across two resistors and the output taken</span> <span
  m='426000'>across one resistor. So that's this value.</span> </p><p><span
  m='429000'>Then I could do the second part.</span> </p><p><span m='432000'>To
  look at the effect of V2, what I will do is short this</span> <span
  m='436000'>voltage and look at the effect of this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='439000'>Now, this voltage is across this resistor divider.</span>
  </p><p><span m='443000'>And so I get R1 / (R1 + R2) here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='447000'>So you'll notice that for something like this,</span> <span
  m='450000'>if I had applied KVL and KCL of the node method I would have</span>
  <span m='454000'>gotten a bunch of equations, but here I wrote it just
  by</span> <span m='458000'>inspection. You should be able to look at</span>
  <span m='461000'>circuit patterns like this and write the answers down
  very</span> <span m='465000'>quickly. Let's say if I chose R1 to be</span>
  <span m='468000'>equal to R2 then V nought would simply be (V1 + V2) /
  2.</span> </p><p><span m='472000'>So if these two values were equal, I simply
  get the output,</span> <span m='476000'>the average of the two
  voltages.</span> </p><p><span m='480000'>So this guy is an adder
  circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='482000'>It adds up these two voltages. But
  more precisely it's an</span> <span m='485000'>averaging circuit. It takes two
  voltages and gives</span> <span m='489000'>me the average value. Now, if you
  have two sensors in</span> <span m='492000'>the room, you might think of why
  you want to take that average</span> <span m='496000'>value to control the
  temperature of the room.</span> </p><p><span m='499000'>But suffice it to say
  that V nought is the average of the two</span> <span m='503000'>values. So let
  me show you a quick demo</span> <span m='506000'>of this example and then look
  at what the problems are with this</span> <span m='510000'>example. So let's
  say,</span> <span m='513000'>as one example, I applied a square wave at
  V1,</span> <span m='516000'>which is the top curve, the green curve,</span>
  <span m='519000'>and I applied a triangular wave at V2, that's the second
  one.</span> </p><p><span m='524000'>As you expect, the output is going to be
  the</span> <span m='528000'>sum of the two voltages scaled
  appropriately.</span> </p><p><span m='531000'>So notice that I have a square
  wave with a superimposed</span> <span m='536000'>triangular wave on top. And I
  can play around.</span> </p><p><span m='541000'>What I could do is change the
  amplitude of my wave form here.</span> </p><p><span m='546000'>And, as you
  notice, the amplitude of the output</span> <span m='551000'>component also
  changes accordingly.</span> </p><p><span m='554000'>So this is one simple
  example of an adder circuit,</span> <span m='558000'>and the two wave forms
  get summed up and I get the output.</span> </p><p><span m='564000'>So I'll
  switch to Page 3. Let me just draw a little</span> <span m='568000'>sketch for
  you here. Here, what I showed you was I</span> <span m='575000'>had a
  triangular wave coming on one of these inputs and I had a</span> <span
  m='584000'>square wave on the other one, and the output looks something</span>
  <span m='592000'>like this.</span> </p><p><span m='604000'>OK? No surprise
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='605000'>This is a simple analog signal processing
  circuit which gives</span> <span m='611000'>me the average of two wave
  forms.</span> </p><p><span m='613000'>Now, let me do the following. Often
  times I may need to look</span> <span m='618000'>at this value some distance
  away.</span> </p><p><span m='621000'>So let's say this person here wants to
  look at the value.</span> </p><p><span m='626000'>So I bring this wire here.
  And I also bring the ground</span> <span m='632000'>connection and I look at
  it. I look at this value here.</span> </p><p><span m='638000'>And when I have
  a long wire I can get noise added onto the</span> <span m='644000'>circuit. So
  let's say a bunch of noise</span> <span m='648000'>gets added into the signal
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='652000'>And what I end up seeing here is not
  something that looks like</span> <span m='658000'>this but something that
  looks like that.</span> </p><p><span m='664000'>That's not unusual. And the
  problem with this is</span> <span m='668000'>now when I look at this, if I'm
  looking to distinguish</span> <span m='672000'>between, say, a 3.9 and a
  3.8,</span> <span m='675000'>it's really hard to do that because my noise is
  overwhelming</span> <span m='680000'>my signal. I have a real problem,</span>
  <span m='683000'>a real problem here. Noise is a fact of life.</span>
  </p><p><span m='687000'>So what do we do? This is so fundamental.</span>
  </p><p><span m='691000'>Large bodies of courses in electrical engineering
  are</span> <span m='695000'>devoted to how do I carefully analyze signals in
  the presence</span> <span m='700000'>of noise? You'll take courses in
  speech</span> <span m='702000'>processing that look at clever techniques to
  recognize speech</span> <span m='707000'>in the presence of noise and so on
  and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='710000'>One technique we adopt that we'll
  talk about here,</span> <span m='714000'>which is fundamental to EECS, is
  using the digital</span> <span m='718000'>abstraction. Let me show you how it
  can</span> <span m='723000'>really help with the noise problem.</span>
  </p><p><span m='727000'>So the idea is value lumping or value
  discretization.</span> </p><p><span m='733000'>Much like we lumped matter,
  we've discretized matter into</span> <span m='740000'>discrete chunks, let's
  discretize value into two</span> <span m='746000'>chunks. Let's simply say
  that now I'm</span> <span m='751000'>going to deal with two values and I can,
  say,</span> <span m='755000'>call them high, low.</span> </p><p><span
  m='757000'>I have a bunch of choices here. I may call it 5 volts and 0</span>
  <span m='763000'>volts. I may call it true and false.</span> </p><p><span
  m='767000'>What I'm doing is I'm just restricting my universe to deal</span>
  <span m='773000'>with just two values, zero and one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='778000'>This is like dealing with a number system with only two</span>
  <span m='781000'>digits. And these are zero and one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='784000'>So what I've now done is I'm saying that rather than dealing</span>
  <span m='788000'>with all possible continuous values, 0.1, 3.9999
  recurring</span> <span m='792000'>and so on and so forth, what I'm going to do
  is simply</span> <span m='796000'>deal with a high and a low. Dealing with
  this whole</span> <span m='799000'>continuum of numbers is really
  complicated.</span> </p><p><span m='802000'>Let me simplify my life and just
  postulate that I am going</span> <span m='806000'>to be looking at high and
  low. Whenever I see something I'll</span> <span m='812000'>look at it and say
  high or low, is it black or white,</span> <span m='817000'>period. There's no
  choice here,</span> <span m='819000'>just two individual values. So that
  sounds simple,</span> <span m='824000'>and nice and so on, but what's the
  point?</span> </p><p><span m='827000'>What do we get by doing that? Let's take
  our example.</span> </p><p><span m='832000'>Let's take what might be a digital
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='835000'>Let's take a digital system and let's
  say I have a sender.</span> </p><p><span m='842000'>Much like I sent a signal
  value a long distance,</span> <span m='847000'>let me have a sender, and I
  have a ground as well and</span> <span m='853000'>here is a receiver. This
  symbol simply says that</span> <span m='858000'>both of them share a ground
  wire.</span> </p><p><span m='862000'>So the sender and a receiver. And what
  I'm interested in</span> <span m='868000'>doing, the sender is interested in
  sending a signal to the</span> <span m='874000'>receiver. And in the digital
  system,</span> <span m='879000'>the way I would send a digital signal is all I
  can use is ones</span> <span m='884000'>and zeros, OK? So let's say the sender
  sends</span> <span m='887000'>something like this. The sender wants to send
  a</span> <span m='891000'>value. This is my time axis and this</span> <span
  m='894000'>is 2.5 volts, this is 0 volts and this is 5</span> <span
  m='897000'>volts. My sender has some agreement</span> <span m='901000'>with
  the receiver and says I'm just going to be sending to you</span> <span
  m='905000'>low values and high values. And this signal here would</span> <span
  m='909000'>correspond to "0" "1" "0". It's a symbol.</span> </p><p><span
  m='912000'>That's why I have input zero in quotes there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='915000'>We'll go into this in much more detail later,</span> <span
  m='918000'>but for now suffice it to say that I'm sending a set of</span>
  <span m='922000'>signals here "0" "1" "0". This simplistic scheme will
  not</span> <span m='926000'>work in many situations but go along with this for
  a few</span> <span m='930000'>seconds. So I send the signal sequence</span>
  <span m='934000'>"0" "1" "0" out here. And notice that there is a high</span>
  <span m='938000'>and a low. And the agreement the sender</span> <span
  m='941000'>and the receiver have is that, look, if you see a value
  that's</span> <span m='945000'>higher than 2.5 volts that's a high.</span>
  </p><p><span m='948000'>If you see a value below 2.5 volts in the wire that's
  a low.</span> </p><p><span m='953000'>And I'm going to send a 0 volt and a 5
  volt from here.</span> </p><p><span m='957000'>So now at the sending site
  let's say I don't have any noise</span> <span m='961000'>in this system. Let's
  say this is my Vn,</span> <span m='966000'>some noise being added. And let's
  say Vn is 0.</span> </p><p><span m='971000'>Then in that case I will receive
  exactly what is sent "0"</span> <span m='978000'>"0" 5, 2.5, 0 volts. And this
  is time.</span> </p><p><span m='982000'>Nothing fancy here, right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='985000'>My receiver receives a "0" "1" "0".</span>
  </p><p><span m='990000'>Now, the beauty of this is that now suppose I were to
  impose</span> <span m='996000'>noise much like I had noise out there and Vn
  was not 0.</span> </p><p><span m='1002000'>Rather Vn was some noise voltage,
  let's say 0.2 volts</span> <span m='1008000'>peak to peak. Let's say that
  simply got</span> <span m='1012000'>superposed on the signal. In which case
  what do I get?</span> </p><p><span m='1018000'>What I end up here with is a
  signal that looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1026000'>So the receiver
  gets that signal because a noise is added</span> <span m='1029000'>into my
  signal and that's what I get.</span> </p><p><span m='1032000'>But guess what?
  No problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1034000'>The receiver says oh, yeah, this
  is a 0 because the</span> <span m='1037000'>values are less than 2.5, this is
  a 1 and this is a 0.</span> </p><p><span m='1041000'>"0" "1" "0". So here my
  receiver was able to</span> <span m='1044000'>receive the signal and correctly
  interpret it without any</span> <span m='1048000'>problems. So because I used
  this value</span> <span m='1052000'>discretization and because I had this
  agreement with the</span> <span m='1056000'>receiver, I had better noise
  immunity.</span> </p><p><span m='1065000'>Consequently, I had what is called a
  noise</span> <span m='1068000'>margin. Noise margin says how much</span> <span
  m='1071000'>noise can I tolerate? And in this situation,</span> <span
  m='1076000'>because the sender sends 5 volts and 0 volts,</span> <span
  m='1080000'>the 5 volts can creep all the way down to 2.5,</span> <span
  m='1084000'>I'll still be OK. Similarly, 0 could go all the</span> <span
  m='1090000'>way up to 2.5, I'd still be OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1094000'>So
  in this case I have a noise margin of 2.5 volts for a 1 and</span> <span
  m='1101000'>similarly 2.5 volts for a 0, because there are 2.5 volts</span>
  <span m='1108000'>between a 0 volt and 2.5. So notice that I have a
  nice</span> <span m='1114000'>little noise margin here, which simply is the
  English</span> <span m='1117000'>meaning of the term there is a margin for
  noise.</span> </p><p><span m='1121000'>And even though I can change the signal
  value by up to 2.5</span> <span m='1125000'>volts, the receiver will still
  correctly interpret the signal.</span> </p><p><span m='1130000'>So I've
  decided to discretize values into highs and lows.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1134000'>And because of that, if all I wanted to do in life</span> <span
  m='1137000'>is send highs and lows I can send them very effectively.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1143000'>There are many complications, but if all I care about
  is</span> <span m='1148000'>sending highs and lows I can send it with a lot of
  tolerance</span> <span m='1154000'>to noise. So many of you are saying
  but</span> <span m='1157000'>what about this, but what about that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1161000'>There are lots of buts here. And let's take a look at
  some</span> <span m='1167000'>of them. If you look up there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1171000'>What I ended up doing was creating a design space
  that</span> <span m='1178000'>looked like this. This is on Page 6.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1182000'>What I did was I said with a range of values from 0
  to 5,</span> <span m='1190000'>what I'm going to do is at 2.5 I drew a line
  and I said as a</span> <span m='1198000'>sender if you wanted to send a 0 then
  you would send a value</span> <span m='1205000'>here. And if you wanted to
  send a 1</span> <span m='1210000'>you would send a value here. Similarly, for
  a receiver.</span> </p><p><span m='1214000'>And if the sender sent a value all
  the way up in 5 volts that</span> <span m='1218000'>was the best thing, but
  technically the sender</span> <span m='1222000'>could send any value between
  2.5 and 5.</span> </p><p><span m='1225000'>And if there was no noise then the
  receiver could correctly</span> <span m='1229000'>interpret a 1 if it was
  above this and 0 if it was below this.</span> </p><p><span m='1235000'>The
  problem with this approach really is that if I allow the</span> <span
  m='1239000'>sender to send any value above 2.5 all the way to 5 then
  there</span> <span m='1244000'>really is no noise margin in this
  situation.</span> </p><p><span m='1253000'>OK? Because if I allowed the
  sender</span> <span m='1255000'>to send any value between 2.5 and 5 then what
  if I have a</span> <span m='1260000'>value 2.5 for a 1? Then I may end up
  getting very</span> <span m='1264000'>little noise margin on the other
  side.</span> </p><p><span m='1268000'>Worse yet, what if I get a value
  2.5?</span> </p><p><span m='1271000'>That's a much worse situation. What if
  the receiver receives a</span> <span m='1276000'>value of 2.5? Now
  what?</span> </p><p><span m='1278000'>What does the receiver do? The receiver
  cannot tell</span> <span m='1283000'>whether it's a 1 or a 0. The receiver
  gets hopelessly</span> <span m='1288000'>confused. So to deal with
  that,</span> <span m='1293000'>I'm going to fix this, what I'm going to do is
  the</span> <span m='1300000'>following. Switch to Page 7.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1305000'>What I'll do here is to prevent the receiver from getting</span>
  <span m='1313000'>confused, if the receiver saw 2.5, what I'm going to do
  is</span> <span m='1322000'>define what is called "no man's land".</span>
  </p><p><span m='1330000'>I'm going to define the region of my voltage space
  called the</span> <span m='1335000'>forbidden region. And what I'm going to do
  is,</span> <span m='1339000'>say, let's say I defined it as 2 volts, 3 volts
  and 5 volts,</span> <span m='1344000'>0, 2, 3 and 5. With my forbidden
  region,</span> <span m='1348000'>if I have a sender then I tell the sender you
  can send any</span> <span m='1353000'>value between 3 and 5 for a 1. And you
  can send any value</span> <span m='1359000'>between 2 and 0 for a 0. To send
  the symbol 0,</span> <span m='1364000'>I can send any voltage between 0 and 2,
  and similarly for 1.</span> </p><p><span m='1370000'>At the receiving side, if
  I see any value between 3</span> <span m='1375000'>and 5, I read that as a 0,
  and any value between 0 and 2 I</span> <span m='1380000'>read that as 2 volts.
  So I may label this value VH</span> <span m='1386000'>and label this threshold
  VL, so there's a high threshold and</span> <span m='1391000'>a low threshold.
  So this solves one problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1395000'>Now the receiver
  can never see a value in the forbidden region.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1400000'>Now, I can stand her and pontificate and say,</span> <span
  m='1404000'>oops, that's a forbidden region, thou shalt not go there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1410000'>But what if I get some noise and a value goes in
  there?</span> </p><p><span m='1413000'>In real systems values may enter
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='1416000'>But what I'm saying, so this is the
  beauty of using</span> <span m='1419000'>a discipline. Let me use my
  playground</span> <span m='1421000'>analogy. This is my playground.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1423000'>We got into this playground using the discrete matter
  of</span> <span m='1427000'>discipline, the playground of EECS, but in that
  playground</span> <span m='1431000'>some region of that playground deals with
  just high and low</span> <span m='1435000'>values. I further restrict
  the</span> <span m='1437000'>playground and I say I'm only going to focus on
  that</span> <span m='1440000'>playground in which all signal values have a
  forbidden region.</span> </p><p><span m='1446000'>All senders and receivers
  adhere to a forbidden region.</span> </p><p><span m='1449000'>And if there is
  any signal in this space, in the forbidden</span> <span m='1454000'>space then
  my behavior is undefined.</span> </p><p><span m='1456000'>I don't care. You
  want to go there?</span> </p><p><span m='1459000'>Sure. I don't know what's
  going to</span> <span m='1461000'>happen to you. Now, we're engineers,</span>
  <span m='1464000'>right? So we've disciplined ourselves</span> <span
  m='1466000'>to play in this playground. It's like I tell my 9-year-old,</span>
  <span m='1472000'>don't go there, right?</span> </p><p><span m='1473000'>And
  of course he wants to go there.</span> </p><p><span m='1476000'>He says what
  will happen if I go there?</span> </p><p><span m='1479000'>And the answer here
  will be undefined, OK?</span> </p><p><span m='1482000'>Something really bad
  could happen to you.</span> </p><p><span m='1485000'>I don't know what it is
  but something really bad,</span> <span m='1488000'>you know, a lightening bolt
  or who knows what,</span> <span m='1492000'>but something really bad. And you
  as a designer of a</span> <span m='1495000'>circuit can, let's say you were
  Intel.</span> </p><p><span m='1500000'>Intel designs its chips. And let's say
  Intel decides to</span> <span m='1502000'>play in this playground and there is
  a forbidden region.</span> </p><p><span m='1505000'>So Intel says oh, it's
  really easy for me if in</span> <span m='1508000'>the forbidden region the
  chip simply burns up and catches</span> <span m='1511000'>fire, we'll sell
  more chips. That's fine.</span> </p><p><span m='1513000'>Whatever you want.
  The key here is that all I'm</span> <span m='1515000'>saying is that I am
  going to discipline myself into playing</span> <span m='1519000'>in this
  playground and that's where I will define my rules,</span> <span
  m='1522000'>and you stay within the boundaries and all the rules</span> <span
  m='1524000'>will apply. It's called a "discipline."</span> <span
  m='1528000'>You're disciplining yourselves to stay within it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1531000'>There's no logic to it. It's just a
  discipline.</span> </p><p><span m='1534000'>Just do it and you'll be OK. When
  we look at practical</span> <span m='1537000'>circuits and so on, we have to
  address the issue of</span> <span m='1540000'>what happens when things go in
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='1543000'>But let's postpone that
  discussion.</span> </p><p><span m='1545000'>For now I've solved one of my
  problems, which is,</span> <span m='1548000'>the previous problem was what
  does a receiver do if it saw a</span> <span m='1552000'>2.5? Now it can't see
  a 2.5.</span> </p><p><span m='1553000'>But then the receiver asks, Agarwal,
  but what if I see a</span> <span m='1557000'>2.5? I can tell the receiver you
  can</span> <span m='1560000'>do whatever you want to do. You can stomp
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='1563000'>You can squish it. You can burn it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1565000'>You can chuck it. Whatever you want.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1567000'>It's up to you. Do whatever you want.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1570000'>You won't see a value. If you do, do whatever
  you</span> <span m='1573000'>want. It's undefined.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1574000'>That works. So you, as the receiver</span> <span
  m='1576000'>designer can do whatever you want when you see a 2.5.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1579000'>You can say yeah, I'll just put out a 1 if I
  see</span> <span m='1582000'>a 2.5 or a 2.6. I'll just do something.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1585000'>No one cares. So this is pretty good.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1587000'>This is pretty good. We still have a problem,</span>
  <span m='1592000'>though. Do people see the problem here?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1595000'>This still doesn't quite work. If Intel did this,</span> <span
  m='1600000'>instead of your laptops failing and blue-screening every
  hour</span> <span m='1606000'>they'd be doing it every millisecond.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1609000'>So the problem is this discipline have allowed
  the</span> <span m='1614000'>sender to send any value between 3 and 5 as a
  1.</span> </p><p><span m='1620000'>And any value between 3 and 5 at the
  receiver is treated as a</span> <span m='1628000'>is? Yes?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1629000'>The sender sends a 1.99 and the noise pumps it into
  forbidden</span> <span m='1634000'>region. Exactly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1636000'>So the sender says it's legitimate, I'm Intel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1640000'>They've told me stick to 0 and</span> <span m='1643000'>And Intel
  parts will be sending to values between 0 and 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1650000'>And Motorola parts, which are receivers,</span> <span
  m='1652000'>you know they have to receive 0 and 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1655000'>So Intel can send the value,</span> <span m='1657000'>They can
  because it's 1.9 out of 2.</span> </p><p><span m='1659000'>It's legal. This
  way I can make really</span> <span m='1662000'>cheap parts. But now the
  problem is that</span> <span m='1665000'>even the smallest amount of noise
  will bump it into the</span> <span m='1668000'>forbidden region, and so
  therefore this one has a</span> <span m='1672000'>problem. And the problem is
  that this</span> <span m='1674000'>one offers zero noise margin. There is no
  noise margin.</span> </p><p><span m='1680000'>There is no margin for noise in
  the discipline.</span> </p><p><span m='1685000'>All right, back to the drawing
  board, folks.</span> </p><p><span m='1690000'>Switch to Page 8. Let's get rid
  of all this stuff</span> <span m='1695000'>and go back to the drawing
  board.</span> </p><p><span m='1711000'>OK, so what do we do now? How about the
  following?</span> </p><p><span m='1715000'>How, about as before I say, as a
  receiver,</span> <span m='1719000'>if you see a value between 3 and 5 you
  treat that as a 1 and</span> <span m='1724000'>a value between 0 and 2 you
  treat that as a 0.</span> </p><p><span m='1729000'>No difference. So as a
  receiver same as</span> <span m='1732000'>before. But now what I do is I hold
  the</span> <span m='1736000'>sender to tougher standards. I hold the feet of
  the sender</span> <span m='1743000'>to the fire and say you have to adhere to
  tougher standards.</span> </p><p><span m='1749000'>So what I'm going to do is
  hold the sender to tougher standards,</span> <span m='1756000'>maybe four
  walls. That is tell the sender that if</span> <span m='1761000'>you want to
  send to 0 or a 1, for a 1 you have to send a</span> <span m='1767000'>value
  between 4 and 5, and for a 0 a value between 0</span> <span m='1773000'>and 1.
  Sender is now held to tougher</span> <span m='1777000'>standards. This is what
  my chart looks</span> <span m='1781000'>like. So now I do have some
  noise</span> <span m='1784000'>margin. Can someone tell me what is the</span>
  <span m='1788000'>noise margin here for a 1? 1 volt.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1791000'>And the reason is that the lowest voltage a sender can send</span>
  <span m='1797000'>is 4 volts, OK? If the 4 leaks down to 2.99</span> <span
  m='1802000'>that's in the forbidden region, I'm in trouble.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1808000'>here. And 2.99 is in the forbidden</span> <span
  m='1810000'>region. I'm in trouble.</span> </p><p><span m='1812000'>So notice
  that the lowest value that the receiver can receive is</span> <span
  m='1817000'>3 volts. So if I sent the 4 and sent</span> <span m='1819000'>this
  over a long cable to you, the value can be beaten up by</span> <span
  m='1824000'>noise to such an extent that you may begin receiving 3s but</span>
  <span m='1828000'>nothing lower than a 3. So this is a noise margin,</span>
  <span m='1835000'>1 volt. Similarly, for a 0 the noise</span> <span
  m='1839000'>margin is also 1 volt. So let me label these.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1844000'>There are four important thresholds here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1848000'>This threshold is called VOL. V output low.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1853000'>These have special meanings. This threshold here is called</span>
  <span m='1861000'>VOH, V output high. This threshold here is called V</span>
  <span m='1866000'>input high and this threshold here is called V input
  low.</span> </p><p><span m='1872000'>So VOH simply says that senders must send
  voltages higher than</span> <span m='1879000'>VOH. Receivers must receive
  values</span> <span m='1883000'>higher than VIH as a 1. So these four
  thresholds</span> <span m='1888000'>together give you your threshold.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1906000'>For the sender gets 2.5, what does sender do?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1910000'>It could do that. So, in that case,</span> <span
  m='1913000'>you can do that. If all you want to do is have</span> <span
  m='1917000'>one value here then what you have is an infinitesimal value</span>
  <span m='1923000'>here for the forbidden region. That's fine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1927000'>It's up to you to design it that way.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1929000'>You can. But it turns out that when you</span> <span
  m='1932000'>design circuits, when we see some examples in</span> <span
  m='1934000'>the next lecture it turns out to be fairly practical and easy
  to</span> <span m='1938000'>do it this way. But, again, these are
  design</span> <span m='1941000'>choices. If I'm Intel,</span> <span
  m='1942000'>Intel wants all its parts to work together.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1945000'>So parts that follow a common discipline can work together,</span>
  <span m='1948000'>right? Because senders will send</span> <span
  m='1953000'>values, receivers will receive these values here,</span> <span
  m='1958000'>so it will simply work. So the noise margin for a 1</span> <span
  m='1965000'>here is simply VOH minus VIH and the noise margin for a 0 is
  VIL</span> <span m='1972000'>minus VOL. VIL minus VOL is the noise</span>
  <span m='1977000'>margin for a 0. So what do we have here?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1982000'>What we have here is a discipline that we've agreed to</span>
  <span m='1986000'>follow where senders are held to a tough standard and
  receivers</span> <span m='1991000'>are held to a different standard so that I
  allow myself some</span> <span m='1996000'>margin for error. And it's up to
  you as a</span> <span m='2000000'>designer to choose ranges for the forbidden
  region.</span> </p><p><span m='2004000'>Now, you may say that I want to make
  my forbidden region as</span> <span m='2009000'>small as possible. But you
  will see in practical</span> <span m='2014000'>circuits it's very hard to
  achieve that.</span> </p><p><span m='2017000'>Practical devices that you get,
  they have a natural region that</span> <span m='2021000'>gets very, very hard
  to break apart, and that tends to</span> <span m='2025000'>establish what that
  region looks like.</span> </p><p><span m='2028000'>So to continue with an
  example here, I may have the following</span> <span m='2033000'>voltage wave
  form for a sender. So I have some sender,</span> <span m='2037000'>I have a
  sender here.</span> </p><p><span m='2048000'>I have VOL, VIL, VIH, VOH and
  some other high</span> <span m='2053000'>voltage. And then, as a
  sender,</span> <span m='2057000'>if I want to send a "0" "1" "0" then I send a
  0.</span> </p><p><span m='2062000'>I have to be within this band. And then for
  a 1 I have to be</span> <span m='2069000'>within this band. So this is an
  example of,</span> <span m='2075000'>say, "0" "1" "0" "1". And at the receiver
  --</span> <span m='2091000'>Let's have VOL, VIL, VIH, VOH.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2095000'>So at the receiver, I interpret any signal below</span> <span
  m='2102000'>VIL as a 0. So I may get some signal that</span> <span
  m='2106000'>looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2116000'>And I'll still
  interpret that as a "0" "1" "0" "1".</span> </p><p><span m='2121000'>So to
  summarize here, this discipline that forms the</span> <span
  m='2126000'>foundations of digital systems is called "a static
  discipline".</span> </p><p><span m='2141000'>The static discipline says if
  inputs meet input thresholds --</span> <span m='2163000'>So if an input to a
  digital system meets the input</span> <span m='2168000'>thresholds then
  outputs will meet, or the digital system</span> <span m='2174000'>should
  ensure that the outputs --</span> <span m='2184000'>Output thresholds. So this
  means that if I have a</span> <span m='2189000'>system like this then if I
  give it good inputs.</span> </p><p><span m='2195000'>And by giving it good
  inputs I mean for 1s I have signal values</span> <span m='2200000'>that are
  greater than VIH and for 0s signal values which are</span> <span
  m='2205000'>less than VIL. These are valid inputs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2208000'>So if my inputs are valid, that is below VIL for a 0 and</span>
  <span m='2213000'>above VIH for a 1 then this digital system D will
  produce</span> <span m='2217000'>corresponding outputs that follow output
  thresholds.</span> </p><p><span m='2223000'>For a 1 it will produce outputs
  that are greater than VOH and if</span> <span m='2227000'>it needs to produce
  a 0 it will produce outputs that are less</span> <span m='2232000'>than VOL.
  So notice that there is this</span> <span m='2235000'>tough requirement in
  digital systems that for the inputs,</span> <span m='2239000'>I should
  recognize as a 1 anything higher than a VIH.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2243000'>But if I want to produce a 1, I have to produce a tough 1</span>
  <span m='2247000'>like a 4-volt 1. So there is a discipline that</span> <span
  m='2251000'>all my digital systems must follow, and that discipline is</span>
  <span m='2255000'>called a static discipline. So static discipline
  encodes</span> <span m='2259000'>the thresholds, encodes four thresholds
  that</span> <span m='2262000'>all digital systems must follow so that they can
  talk to each</span> <span m='2266000'>other. So if Intel and Motorola
  want</span> <span m='2269000'>to make parts that are compatible with,</span>
  <span m='2271000'>say, Pentium 4 devices then they will all talk over
  the</span> <span m='2275000'>phone or something and agree on a static
  discipline.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>We will say that, all right, all
  my peripherals</span> <span m='2282000'>will follow a static discipline with
  the following volted</span> <span m='2285000'>thresholds. And this way parts
  made by</span> <span m='2287000'>different manufacturers can interoperate and
  still provide</span> <span m='2290000'>immunity to noise. Yes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2291000'>Question?</span> </p><p><span m='2299000'>Absolutely.
  There are many constraints on</span> <span m='2301000'>how you as a designer
  choose the noise margin.</span> </p><p><span m='2304000'>As a designer you
  want to make your noise margin as large as</span> <span m='2308000'>possible.
  The larger the noise margin the</span> <span m='2312000'>better you can
  tolerate noise which is why,</span> <span m='2315000'>how many people have
  heard of some devices called rad hard</span> <span m='2320000'>devices,
  radiation hard devices? Some of you have.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2324000'>There are a bunch of devices. Different manufacturers make</span>
  <span m='2328000'>different kinds of devices for different markets.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2332000'>For consumer markets they use parts which may have
  relatively</span> <span m='2337000'>poor noise margins because consumers can
  tolerate more</span> <span m='2341000'>faults. But if you're building
  devices</span> <span m='2345000'>for, say, the medical industry or for
  spaceships and so on,</span> <span m='2349000'>you need to be held to a much,
  much tougher standard.</span> </p><p><span m='2353000'>So for those devices
  you may end up having much,</span> <span m='2356000'>much tighter bands in
  which you have to operate so you have a</span> <span m='2360000'>tougher noise
  margin. So that leads us to,</span> <span m='2363000'>given these sort of
  voltage thresholds, we now move into the</span> <span m='2368000'>digital
  world. And in the digital world we can</span> <span m='2371000'>build a bunch
  of digital devices.</span> </p><p><span m='2373000'>The first device we will
  look at is called a combinational</span> <span m='2376000'>gate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2382000'>A combinational gate is a device that adheres to
  the</span> <span m='2386000'>static discipline, Page 11, and this is a
  device</span> <span m='2391000'>whose outputs are a function of inputs
  alone.</span> </p><p><span m='2403000'>So I can build little boxes which take
  some inputs,</span> <span m='2407000'>produces an output where the outputs are
  a function of the</span> <span m='2413000'>existing inputs. And this kind of a
  device is</span> <span m='2417000'>called a combinational gate. And I can
  analyze such devices</span> <span m='2422000'>for the kinds of things that I
  would like to do.</span> </p><p><span m='2428000'>Before I go into the kinds
  of devices I'd like to build,</span> <span m='2434000'>let's spend a few
  minutes talking about how to process</span> <span m='2439000'>signals. How to
  process digital signals,</span> <span m='2444000'>Page 10. So notice that you
  have two</span> <span m='2448000'>values, 0 and a 1. So devices like my</span>
  <span m='2452000'>combinational gate, for example,</span> <span
  m='2455000'>can only deal with 0s and 1s. So I have to come up with
  some</span> <span m='2462000'>kind of a mathematics or some kind of a set of
  processing that</span> <span m='2466000'>can work with 0,1 values. So 0,1 map
  completely natural</span> <span m='2470000'>to the logic true and false. So I
  can borrow from logic and</span> <span m='2475000'>use true and false to do my
  processing of signals.</span> </p><p><span m='2479000'>So if all I care about
  is processing logic values,</span> <span m='2483000'>0s and 1s, trues and
  falses then that's all I need.</span> </p><p><span m='2489000'>I can also use
  numbers. How do I represent a number?</span> </p><p><span m='2493000'>3.9
  which is 0s and 1s. It turns out that this is a</span> <span m='2498000'>whole
  field in itself. You'll hear more about this in</span> <span
  m='2503000'>recitation. Let me also point you to the</span> <span
  m='2506000'>last section of the course notes, Chapter 5.6 I believe,</span>
  <span m='2512000'>that talks about how to represent numbers.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2517000'>The basic insight is much like you can represent
  arbitrary long</span> <span m='2521000'>numbers with the digits 0 through 9 in
  the same way,</span> <span m='2525000'>but concatenating digits you can
  represent arbitrary long</span> <span m='2529000'>numbers with 0-1-1-1-0-0 and
  so on.</span> </p><p><span m='2531000'>So you can have a whole sequence of
  digits and you can</span> <span m='2535000'>build a binary number system. So
  you can read A&L Section</span> <span m='2539000'>5.6, I believe. It's the
  last section for</span> <span m='2542000'>numbers. And you will also discuss
  this</span> <span m='2544000'>in your recitation tomorrow. Let me spend some
  more time</span> <span m='2551000'>talking about Boolean logic, two-valued
  logic,</span> <span m='2556000'>and how to process these systems.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2560000'>So one way of processing it is using logic statements
  of the</span> <span m='2566000'>following form. If X is true and Y is true
  then</span> <span m='2572000'>Z is true, else is Z false. So this is a logic
  statement.</span> </p><p><span m='2580000'>It says if X is true and Y is true
  then Z is true,</span> <span m='2584000'>else Z is false. So I can process
  this with 0s</span> <span m='2588000'>and 1s, trues and falses. And I do this
  all the time so I</span> <span m='2593000'>have a succinct notation for
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='2596000'>I express this as Z is X anded with
  Y.</span> </p><p><span m='2600000'>X and Y is Z. So Z is true if X is true and
  Y</span> <span m='2604000'>is true. A shorthand notation for this</span> <span
  m='2607000'>is just a dot. And a circuit notation for this</span> <span
  m='2613000'>is called an "AND gate". That's a little circuit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2618000'>I haven't told you what's inside it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2621000'>It's an abstract little device called an AND gate
  which takes</span> <span m='2627000'>two inputs, produces one output Z where
  the output is related to</span> <span m='2634000'>the inputs in the following
  manner.</span> </p><p><span m='2639000'>That's a little device called an AND
  gate.</span> </p><p><span m='2643000'>I could also represent logic in truth
  tables.</span> </p><p><span m='2647000'>And truth tables simply enumerate all
  the values and the</span> <span m='2652000'>corresponding outputs. Inputs can
  be 0-0-0-1-1-0 or</span> <span m='2657000'>1-1. For an AND system output is
  1,</span> <span m='2661000'>only if both are ones, it's a 0 otherwise.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2665000'>So that's a truth table for AND gate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2670000'>So from 0s and 1s we deal with logic and we create
  devices like</span> <span m='2676000'>the AND gate to process digital
  signals.</span> </p><p><span m='2680000'>And what we will do is look at a
  whole bunch of little symbols</span> <span m='2686000'>like this, like the AND
  gate to process our input signals.</span> </p><p><span m='2691000'>And these
  devices might look like other functions like OR</span> <span m='2697000'>gates
  and so on. Let me show you a quick demo.</span> </p><p><span m='2703000'>What
  I'm going to show you is a signal feeding an AND gate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2709000'>And one signal is going to look like this, and my signal Y
  is</span> <span m='2715000'>going to look like this. So you expect a
  processed</span> <span m='2721000'>output. So 1-0-1-0-1-0-1.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2723000'>And the output is simply going to be --</span> <span
  m='2729000'>This is my time axis going this way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2731000'>It is going to be an AND-ing of these two signal values like
  so.</span> </p><p><span m='2735000'>What I'm also going to show you is I'm
  going to superimpose</span> <span m='2739000'>noise on this wire. I'm going to
  superimpose noise</span> <span m='2743000'>on the wire, and what I want you to
  observe is the output of this</span> <span m='2747000'>digital gate. The
  output will stay exactly</span> <span m='2750000'>like this, even though I
  impose noise.</span> </p><p><span m='2752000'>The ultimate test. So stay right
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='2755000'>Let's do this demo. Give me a couple of
  seconds.</span> </p><p><span m='2862000'>If you look at the signal up there,
  look at the middle wave</span> <span m='2865000'>form, and I'm imposing let's
  have a digital system in a noisy</span> <span m='2869000'>environment like a
  lumberyard, for example,</span> <span m='2872000'>or chopping a bunch of trees
  in my backyard and building digital</span> <span m='2876000'>systems on the
  side. And if I have my buddies</span> <span m='2880000'>revving up chainsaws
  superimposing noise on my second</span> <span m='2884000'>input, but look at
  the output. And just to show that I'm not</span> <span m='2890000'>bluffing
  here, what I'll do is I'll pass the</span> <span m='2893000'>noise through and
  make the noise larger.</span> </p><p><span m='2897000'>And you'll notice that
  when the noise begins to surpass the</span> <span m='2902000'>noise margins
  the output begins to go berserk.</span> </p><p><span m='2906000'>Watch. Can
  you increase it gradually?</span> </p><p><span m='2911000'>Notice that as I
  put in a lot more noise then the output</span> <span m='2915000'>begins to go
  berserk, but as long as my input is</span> <span m='2920000'>within the noise
  margin my output stays perfectly stable.</span> </p><p><span m='2925000'>So
  that's the "Intro to Digital Systems".</span> </p><p><span m='2928000'>You'll
  see numbers in recitation.</span> </p><p><span m='2931000'>And we'll see you
  at lecture on Tuesday.</span> </p>
