transcript: >-
  <p><span m='0'>Before I begin today, I thought I would take the</span> <span
  m='3000'>first five minutes and show you some fun stuff I have been</span>
  <span m='8000'>hacking on for the past three years.</span> </p><p><span
  m='10000'>This has to do with 6.002 and circuits and all that stuff,</span>
  <span m='15000'>but this is completely optional, this is for fun,</span> <span
  m='19000'>this is to go build your intuition, this is to check your</span>
  <span m='23000'>answers, whatever you want. This is not a required part
  of</span> <span m='28000'>the course. Just for fun.</span> </p><p><span
  m='31000'>There is this URL out here that I put down here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34000'>I have been hacking on this system for the past three years,</span>
  <span m='39000'>and for the first time this year and very tentatively
  and</span> <span m='44000'>gingerly introducing it to students.</span>
  </p><p><span m='46000'>The idea here is that it is a, that is kind of
  defocused.</span> </p><p><span m='51000'>Any chance of focusing that a little
  bit better?</span> </p><p><span m='63000'>The idea of this is that it is a
  Web-based interactive</span> <span m='68000'>simulation package that I have
  pulled together.</span> </p><p><span m='72000'>And what you can do is you can
  pull up a bunch of circuits.</span> </p><p><span m='78000'>Notice that the URL
  is up here. It is</span> <span m='82000'>euryale.lcs.mit.edu/websim. And there
  is the pointer to it.</span> </p><p><span m='89000'>So you have a bunch of fun
  things you can play with.</span> </p><p><span m='93000'>And we have gone
  through all of these things in lecture.</span> </p><p><span m='98000'>Let's
  pick the MOSFET amplifier.</span> </p><p><span m='100000'>You come to this
  page. This is something you have seen</span> <span m='105000'>in class. And
  let's play with this little</span> <span m='108000'>circuit. And you see the
  mouse?</span> </p><p><span m='111000'>Good. You can set up a bunch of</span>
  <span m='113000'>parameters. You can set up the MOSFET</span> <span
  m='116000'>parameters VT and K. You can set up the value of R</span> <span
  m='122000'>for your resistor, you can establish a bias</span> <span
  m='125000'>voltage, and you can have an input voltage vIN.</span> </p><p><span
  m='128000'>So you can apply a bunch of input voltages.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131000'>You can apply a zero input, unit in pulse,</span> <span
  m='134000'>unit step, sine wave, square waves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='136000'>Or this was the part that took me the longest to get right.</span>
  </p><p><span m='140000'>You can also input a bunch of music.</span>
  </p><p><span m='143000'>And so far I just have two clips, so you are going to
  get</span> <span m='147000'>bored listening to them. Good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='150000'>So you can also input music. And what you can do is you can</span>
  <span m='153000'>watch the waveforms, you can listen to the output</span>
  <span m='156000'>and do a bunch of fun stuff. One experiment I would love
  for</span> <span m='160000'>you guys to try out. Again, remember,</span> <span
  m='162000'>this is completely optional. Just for fun.</span> </p><p><span
  m='165000'>You can apply some input. Step input, for example,</span> <span
  m='168000'>to an RLC circuit and spend 30 seconds thinking about what</span>
  <span m='171000'>should the output look like. I divine that the output
  should</span> <span m='175000'>look like this and then do this and see if what
  you thought was</span> <span m='179000'>correct. And it's fun to kind of
  play</span> <span m='183000'>around with it. Let me start with,</span> <span
  m='186000'>just as an example, let's say I input classical</span> <span
  m='190000'>music. And let us say I would like to</span> <span
  m='193000'>listen to the output here that is the voltage at the drain</span>
  <span m='198000'>terminal of the MOSFET. For listening it sets up a</span>
  <span m='202000'>default timeframe to listen to, so you go ahead and do
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='209000'>This shows you the time domain waveform of
  a clip of the music</span> <span m='213000'>and then you can listen to it.
  Lot's of distortion,</span> <span m='217000'>right? As you can see,</span>
  <span m='219000'>there is a bunch of distortion. And that is as you
  expect</span> <span m='223000'>because the peak-to-peak voltage is 1 volt, the
  bias is 2.5,</span> <span m='228000'>and so this is clipping at the lower end,
  plus the MOSFET is</span> <span m='232000'>nonlinear. You can play around with
  a</span> <span m='235000'>bunch of things and you can have a lot of
  fun.</span> </p><p><span m='240000'>And the reason I created this is that MIT
  is putting a bunch</span> <span m='243000'>of its courses on the Web. And one
  of the hottest things</span> <span m='245000'>about courses like this is the
  lab component.</span> </p><p><span m='248000'>If you are beaming a course to,
  say, a Third World country or</span> <span m='251000'>something, how do you
  get people to set up the massive lab</span> <span m='254000'>infrastructure? I
  know you hate your</span> <span m='255000'>oscilloscopes, I know you hate your
  wires,</span> <span m='258000'>I know you hate the clips, but the fact is you
  have them.</span> </p><p><span m='260000'>I know a lot of places those are way
  too expensive to pull</span> <span m='263000'>together, which is why I have
  been creating this Web-based</span> <span m='266000'>kind of interactive
  laboratory so that people can learn this</span> <span m='269000'>stuff over
  the Web. Let's go do another example</span> <span m='274000'>very quickly.
  Let's say you learned about,</span> <span m='278000'>well, let's do RC
  circuits. Here is the parallel RC</span> <span m='282000'>circuit. And you can
  set up capacitor</span> <span m='285000'>values, resistor values, you can set
  up input.</span> </p><p><span m='289000'>Here, let me look at the time domain
  waveform for the voltage</span> <span m='295000'>across the capacitor. And
  this time around let me</span> <span m='299000'>play a unit step. And let's
  see what the output</span> <span m='304000'>is going to look like. You can
  think in your minds</span> <span m='308000'>what should the output look like,
  and then you can go and</span> <span m='312000'>plot it. There you go.</span>
  </p><p><span m='314000'>That's what the output looks like.</span> </p><p><span
  m='317000'>So you can play around with it and have fun.</span> </p><p><span
  m='320000'>That's all the good news. The bad news is that so far I</span>
  <span m='325000'>just have one Pentium III machine behind us.</span>
  </p><p><span m='330000'>It is a Linux box, so don't all of you try it
  at</span> <span m='333000'>once. However, what I have also done,</span> <span
  m='335000'>and that took me another six months of hacking in the small</span>
  <span m='339000'>amount of time professors have to hack on stuff,</span> <span
  m='342000'>I've hacked an incredibly elaborate cashing system so that</span>
  <span m='345000'>once anyone in class tries out some combination of
  parameters</span> <span m='349000'>it goes and squirrels away all the
  outputs.</span> </p><p><span m='352000'>If anybody else types in the same sets
  of parameters it will</span> <span m='355000'>just get all the output and play
  it back to you.</span> </p><p><span m='360000'>So if enough of you play with
  over time, we may end up cashing</span> <span m='364000'>all the important
  waveforms and music clips and all of that</span> <span m='367000'>stuff. I
  have allocated a few</span> <span m='369000'>gigabytes of storage, so I am
  hoping that it may</span> <span m='372000'>work. Go forth.</span> </p><p><span
  m='373000'>Play with it. And this is completely my</span> <span
  m='376000'>fault, so if there are any bugs or anything simply email them
  to</span> <span m='380000'>me. This is the first time this is</span> <span
  m='382000'>coming alive so bear with it. Now let me switch back to the</span>
  <span m='386000'>scheduled presentation for today.</span> </p><p><span
  m='430000'>All right, hope and pray that this works.</span> </p><p><span
  m='433000'>Yes. Good.</span> </p><p><span m='434000'>I am going to do today's
  lecture using view graphs.</span> </p><p><span m='439000'>And the reason I am
  going to do that and not do my usual</span> <span m='445000'>blackboard
  presentation which I way, way, way prefer to a view</span> <span
  m='451000'>graph presentation. The only reason I am going to</span> <span
  m='455000'>do this for today, and maybe one more lecture,</span> <span
  m='458000'>is that there is just a huge amount of math grunge in this</span>
  <span m='462000'>lecture. What I want to do is kind of</span> <span
  m='464000'>blast through that, but you will have it all in the</span> <span
  m='467000'>notes that you have, so that you don't waste time in</span> <span
  m='470000'>class as you watch me stumbling over twiddles and tildes and
  all</span> <span m='474000'>that stuff. The key thing here is that the</span>
  <span m='477000'>insight is actually very simple. The beginning and the end
  are</span> <span m='481000'>connected very tightly and very simple.</span>
  </p><p><span m='484000'>There is a bunch of math grunge in the middle that we
  are going</span> <span m='488000'>to work through and, again, follows a
  complete old</span> <span m='491000'>established pattern. So, in that
  sense,</span> <span m='493000'>there is really nothing dramatically new in
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='496000'>Let me spend the next five minutes
  reviewing for you how we</span> <span m='500000'>got here, what have we
  covered so far and set up the</span> <span m='503000'>presentation. The first
  ten view graphs I am</span> <span m='506000'>going to blast through and just
  tell you where we are in terms</span> <span m='510000'>of LC and RLC circuits.
  I began by showing you this</span> <span m='515000'>little demo, two
  inverters, one driving.</span> </p><p><span m='519000'>I can model the
  inductance here with a little inductor,</span> <span m='524000'>the capacitor
  of the gate here. And recall that when I wanted</span> <span m='530000'>to
  speed this up by introducing a 50 ohm smaller resistance,</span> <span
  m='535000'>I got some really strange behavior.</span> </p><p><span
  m='540000'>Just to remind you, for Tuesday's lecture it would</span> <span
  m='544000'>help if you quickly reviewed the appendix on complex algebra
  in</span> <span m='549000'>the course notes. Remember all the real and</span>
  <span m='553000'>imaginary j and omega stuff? It would be good to very</span>
  <span m='557000'>quickly skim through that. It is a couple of pages.</span>
  </p><p><span m='561000'>Remember this demo? And the relevant circuit
  that</span> <span m='565000'>is of interest to us is this one here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='570000'>It is the resistor, there is the inductor and
  there</span> <span m='573000'>is a capacitor. This is Page 3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='575000'>I am just going to blast through the first ten
  view</span> <span m='579000'>graphs. It is all old stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='580000'>Then we observed the following output.</span> </p><p><span
  m='583000'>We applied this input at VA and we got this output,</span> <span
  m='586000'>a very slowly rising waveform because of the RC transient.</span>
  </p><p><span m='590000'>And because of that you saw a delay.</span>
  </p><p><span m='593000'>Notice that this delay was because of the slowly
  rising</span> <span m='597000'>transient. This waveform took some time
  to</span> <span m='601000'>hit the threshold of the neighboring
  transistor.</span> </p><p><span m='604000'>So we say ah-ha, let's try to speed
  this sucker</span> <span m='607000'>up by reducing the resistance in the
  collector of the first</span> <span m='611000'>inverter. And so I had this
  input.</span> </p><p><span m='613000'>Now, to my surprise, instead of seeing a
  nice little</span> <span m='617000'>much higher and much faster transitioning
  circuit,</span> <span m='620000'>well, I did see a much faster transitioning
  circuit but I got</span> <span m='624000'>all this strange behavior on the
  output that I was interested in.</span> </p><p><span m='630000'>And because of
  that, if these excursions were low</span> <span m='633000'>enough, I could
  actually trigger the output and get a whole bunch</span> <span m='637000'>of
  false ones here because of these negative excursions which</span> <span
  m='641000'>should not really be there. That was kind of strange.</span>
  </p><p><span m='645000'>In the last lecture we said let's take this one step
  at a</span> <span m='649000'>time. Let's not jump into an RLC</span> <span
  m='651000'>circuit. Let's go step by step.</span> </p><p><span
  m='653000'>Let's start with an LC, understand the behavior.</span>
  </p><p><span m='658000'>We started off with an LC circuit of this sort,</span>
  <span m='661000'>and using the node equation we showed that this was
  the</span> <span m='665000'>equation that governed the behavior of the
  circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='669000'>And then we said that for a step input
  and for zero initial</span> <span m='673000'>conditions, that is the zero
  state response,</span> <span m='676000'>let's find out what the output, the
  voltage across the</span> <span m='680000'>capacitor looks like. And so we
  obtained the total</span> <span m='684000'>solution to be this. And there was
  a sinusoidal term</span> <span m='688000'>in there. And the omega nought which
  was</span> <span m='692000'>one by square root of LC. And this was the
  circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='696000'>And so for this step input notice that
  the output looked</span> <span m='700000'>like this. So far an input step I
  had an</span> <span m='703000'>output that went like this. Notice that it is
  indeed</span> <span m='707000'>possible for the output voltage to actually go
  above the input</span> <span m='711000'>value VI. This is kind of
  non-intuitive</span> <span m='714000'>but this can happen. So this waveform
  jumps up and</span> <span m='718000'>down. But the steady state value,</span>
  <span m='721000'>on average if you will, is VI.</span> </p><p><span
  m='723000'>On the other hand, it does have sinusoidal</span> <span
  m='726000'>excursions and this kind of goes on because there is nothing
  to</span> <span m='730000'>dissipate the energy inside that circuit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='733000'>By the way, the fact that the capacitor voltage shoots
  above</span> <span m='737000'>the input voltage is actually a very important
  property.</span> </p><p><span m='741000'>We won't dwell on it in 6.002, but
  just squirrel that away in</span> <span m='745000'>your brain somewhere. I
  promise you that some time in</span> <span m='750000'>your life you will have
  to create a little design somewhere</span> <span m='754000'>that will need a
  higher voltage than your DC input.</span> </p><p><span m='757000'>And you can
  use this primitive fact to actually produce a DC</span> <span
  m='761000'>voltage higher than you are given, and then use that</span> <span
  m='765000'>somehow. In fact, there is a whole</span> <span m='767000'>research
  area of what are called DC to DC converters,</span> <span m='771000'>voltage
  converters. Let's say you have 1.5 volt</span> <span m='774000'>battery, a AA
  battery, but let's say a circuit needs</span> <span m='778000'>1.8 volts. The
  Pentium IIIs,</span> <span m='781000'>for example, needed 1.8 volts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='783000'>And the strong arm is another chip that required 1.8
  volts a</span> <span m='787000'>few years ago, but the AA cell was 1.5
  volts.</span> </p><p><span m='790000'>How do get 1.8 from 1.5? Well, you have
  to step it up</span> <span m='793000'>somehow. And this basic principle
  where</span> <span m='796000'>the voltage can jump up above the input is
  actually used,</span> <span m='799000'>of course with additional circuitry, to
  kind of get higher</span> <span m='803000'>voltages. It is a really key point
  that</span> <span m='806000'>you can squirrel away. This was pretty much where
  we</span> <span m='811000'>got to in the last lecture. This starts off the
  material</span> <span m='815000'>for today. What we are going to do is
  take</span> <span m='818000'>that same circuit, but instead we are going to
  put</span> <span m='822000'>in this little resistor here. This is what we set
  out to</span> <span m='827000'>analyze. And for details you can read</span>
  <span m='830000'>the course notes Section 13.6. The green curve here was
  the</span> <span m='834000'>behavior of the LC circuit. And what we are going
  to show</span> <span m='840000'>today is that the moment we introduce R this
  sinusoid here</span> <span m='844000'>gets damp. It kind of loses
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='846000'>And I am going to show you that the
  behavior is going to look</span> <span m='851000'>like this. By introducing R
  this guy</span> <span m='854000'>doesn't keep oscillating forever.</span>
  </p><p><span m='856000'>Rather it begins to oscillate and then kind of loses
  energy</span> <span m='860000'>and kind of gets tired and settles down at
  VI.</span> </p><p><span m='864000'>And remember the demo. This is exactly what
  you saw in</span> <span m='868000'>the demo. You had a step input and
  you</span> <span m='872000'>had this funny behavior. And for the RLC that is
  exactly</span> <span m='876000'>what it was. So today's lecture will
  close</span> <span m='879000'>the loop on what you saw in the demo and the
  weird behavior,</span> <span m='883000'>and I am going to show you the
  mathematics foundations for that</span> <span m='888000'>today. Let's go ahead
  and analyze the</span> <span m='890000'>RLC circuit. I purposely created the
  entire</span> <span m='893000'>presentation to follow as closely as possible
  both the</span> <span m='897000'>discussion of the RC networks and the LC
  networks so that the</span> <span m='902000'>math is all the same. Exactly the
  same steps in the</span> <span m='906000'>mathematics are in the exposition of
  the analysis.</span> </p><p><span m='910000'>What's different are the results
  because the circuit is</span> <span m='913000'>different. So don't get bogged
  down or</span> <span m='915000'>whatever in the mathematics. Just remember it
  is the same</span> <span m='919000'>set of steps that you are going to be
  applying.</span> </p><p><span m='922000'>We start by writing down the element
  rules for our elements.</span> </p><p><span m='926000'>Nothing new here. For
  the inductor V is Ldi/dt.</span> </p><p><span m='930000'>The integral form
  which is simply 1/L integral vLdt=i.</span> </p><p><span m='933000'>We saw
  this the last time. And for the capacitor,</span> <span m='937000'>the current
  through the capacitor is simply Cdv/dt.</span> </p><p><span m='941000'>Those
  are the two element rules for the capacitor and inductor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='945000'>The element rule for the resistor, of course,</span> <span
  m='949000'>is V=iR. You know that.</span> </p><p><span m='950000'>And for the
  voltage source we know that, too,</span> <span m='953000'>the voltage is a
  constant. Just follow the same</span> <span m='957000'>established pattern. By
  the way, just so you are</span> <span m='962000'>aware, I have booby trapped
  the presentation a little bit to</span> <span m='968000'>prevent you from
  falling asleep. You see the dash lines here?</span> </p><p><span
  m='974000'>Whenever you see a dash line, that stuff needs to be copied</span>
  <span m='979000'>down. Don't trip over that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='982000'>Don't say I didn't warn you. We start by using the usual</span>
  <span m='987000'>node method. And I have two nodes in this</span> <span
  m='991000'>case. Unlike the LC circuits,</span> <span m='993000'>I have two
  unknown nodes. One is this node here with the</span> <span m='997000'>node
  voltage vA and the second node is the node with voltage</span> <span
  m='1002000'>vT. Let me start with vA and write</span> <span m='1004000'>the
  node equation for that. It is simply 1/L,</span> <span m='1007000'>the node
  equation for this is the current going in this</span> <span
  m='1011000'>direction with is vI-vA integral and that equals the
  current</span> <span m='1015000'>going this way which is vA-v/R, node
  equation.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>I then write the node equation for
  the node v,</span> <span m='1023000'>for this node here, and that is
  simply</span> <span m='1026000'>(vA-v)/R=Cdvdt. And that is what I have
  here,</span> <span m='1029000'>two node equations. Let me summarize the
  results</span> <span m='1033000'>for you and then show you a view graph where
  I grind through the</span> <span m='1037000'>math as to how I got the result.
  Here is the result I am going</span> <span m='1042000'>to get. If I take these
  two node</span> <span m='1044000'>equations and I massage some of the
  mathematics,</span> <span m='1048000'>I am going to get this result. And I
  will show you that in a</span> <span m='1054000'>second. By grinding through
  some math</span> <span m='1057000'>and solving these two equations and
  expressing this in terms of</span> <span m='1062000'>v, I get a second order
  differential equation,</span> <span m='1066000'>d^2v blah, blah, blah.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1068000'>Notice that this is different from the LC in this
  term.</span> </p><p><span m='1072000'>Every step of the way you can check to
  see if I am lying or I</span> <span m='1077000'>am correct. I will indulge
  you,</span> <span m='1081000'>indulge myself rather with a little story
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1084000'>Richard Fineman was a known smart
  guy.</span> </p><p><span m='1086000'>And one of the reasons that he was that
  was in the middle of</span> <span m='1090000'>talks he was known to get up and
  ask some of the darndest,</span> <span m='1094000'>hardest questions and say
  ah-ha, you have a bug in this</span> <span m='1097000'>proof here or a bug in
  this equation that is not right.</span> </p><p><span m='1101000'>And usually
  he would be correct.</span> </p><p><span m='1103000'>So his trick in doing
  this and which is one reason how he</span> <span m='1107000'>became a known
  smart guy. What he would do is,</span> <span m='1111000'>as the speaker went
  on talking he would kind of follow along</span> <span m='1114000'>and think of
  a simple initial primitive case.</span> </p><p><span m='1116000'>In this case,
  I have an RLC circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='1118000'>So think of a simpler
  case of this.</span> </p><p><span m='1120000'>A simpler case of this is R=0.
  Whenever you set R to be zero,</span> <span m='1123000'>you should get exactly
  what we got in the last lecture,</span> <span m='1126000'>correct? That is
  what Fineman would do.</span> </p><p><span m='1128000'>He would boil this down
  to a simpler case,</span> <span m='1130000'>make some assumptions and just
  follow along.</span> </p><p><span m='1132000'>And whenever he found a
  discrepancy between the math</span> <span m='1135000'>here and his simple case
  he would say oh,</span> <span m='1137000'>there is a bug there. If you want
  you can catch me</span> <span m='1142000'>that way. Here, what Fineman would
  do is</span> <span m='1144000'>replace R being zero, and notice then this
  equation</span> <span m='1148000'>here is exactly what we got the last time
  with R being zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1152000'>Just remember that Fineman
  trick.</span> </p><p><span m='1154000'>This is the equation we get, the
  second-order differential</span> <span m='1158000'>equation with an R term in
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='1161000'>And let me just grind through the math
  and show you how I got</span> <span m='1165000'>this from this. So the two
  node equations</span> <span m='1168000'>again. And what I do is I start
  by</span> <span m='1172000'>taking these two equations and differentiating
  this with</span> <span m='1178000'>respect to t and this is what I get.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1182000'>And, at the same time, I have replaced (vA-v)/R
  here</span> <span m='1188000'>by this term. I replace this with this
  and</span> <span m='1192000'>differentiate. Then I simply divide the
  whole</span> <span m='1197000'>thing by C. Then I take this expression</span>
  <span m='1202000'>here and write down vA is equal to this stuff here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1207000'>Next I am going to substitute this back for vA and
  eliminate</span> <span m='1212000'>vA. So I take this vA,</span> <span
  m='1214000'>stick the sucker in here, and thereby eliminate vA and</span>
  <span m='1219000'>get this. And then I simplify it and here</span> <span
  m='1223000'>is what I get. That is what I get.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1226000'>I just grind through the two equations and get that result.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1233000'>So like a stuck record I will repeat our mantra
  here,</span> <span m='1236000'>which is here is how we solve the equations
  that we run across</span> <span m='1240000'>in this course, the same three
  steps.</span> </p><p><span m='1243000'>Find the particular solution. Find the
  homogenous solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1247000'>Find the total solution
  and then find the constants using</span> <span m='1251000'>the initial
  conditions. Same steps.</span> </p><p><span m='1253000'>You could recite this
  in your sleep.</span> </p><p><span m='1256000'>And the homogenous solution is
  obtained using a further four</span> <span m='1260000'>steps. Let's just go
  through and apply</span> <span m='1264000'>this method to our equation and get
  the results.</span> </p><p><span m='1267000'>vP is a particular solution and
  vH is the homogenous solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1271000'>With a
  particular solution, oh.</span> </p><p><span m='1273000'>Before I go on to do
  that, let me set up my inputs and my</span> <span m='1277000'>state variables.
  My input is going to be a step.</span> </p><p><span m='1281000'>Remember, I am
  trying to take you to the point where the demo</span> <span m='1285000'>left
  off. The demo had a step input,</span> <span m='1287000'>so I am going to use
  a step input rising to vI.</span> </p><p><span m='1292000'>And I am going to
  with the initial conditions being all</span> <span m='1296000'>zeros. So the
  capacitor voltage is</span> <span m='1299000'>zero, inductor current, another
  state variable is also</span> <span m='1303000'>zero, and therefore this is
  also fondly called the ZSR or the</span> <span m='1308000'>zero state response
  because there is only an input but zero</span> <span m='1313000'>state. Again,
  remember the dashed</span> <span m='1315000'>lines here. Don't say I didn't
  warn you.</span> </p><p><span m='1320000'>Let's start with a particular
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1322000'>This is as simple as it gets. I
  simply write down the</span> <span m='1325000'>particular equation and stick
  my specific input.</span> </p><p><span m='1327000'>And remember the solution
  to the particular equation is any</span> <span m='1331000'>old solution, it
  doesn't have to be a general</span> <span m='1333000'>solution, any old
  solution that satisfies it.</span> </p><p><span m='1336000'>And I am going to
  find a simple solution here.</span> </p><p><span m='1338000'>And V particular
  is a constant VI.</span> </p><p><span m='1340000'>It works. Because remember
  this has been</span> <span m='1342000'>working all along. And I am going to
  keep pushing</span> <span m='1345000'>this and see if this works until the end
  of the course.</span> </p><p><span m='1350000'>Guess what? It will.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1351000'>So this is a solution. I'm done.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1353000'>That is my particular solution. Simple.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1356000'>Second, I go and do my homogenous solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1359000'>And the homogenous equation, remember, is the same old</span>
  <span m='1363000'>differential equation with the drive set to zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1367000'>Remember that sometimes this equation with the drive
  set to</span> <span m='1371000'>zero is the entire equation you have to deal
  with in situations</span> <span m='1375000'>where you have zero input, for
  example.</span> </p><p><span m='1380000'>Or in other situations in which you
  have an impulse at the</span> <span m='1383000'>input. And the impulse simply
  sets up</span> <span m='1386000'>the initial conditions like a charge in the
  capacitor or</span> <span m='1389000'>something like that. So we are going to
  blast</span> <span m='1392000'>through this four-step method. The method
  simply says that</span> <span m='1396000'>four steps, I am going to assume a
  solution of the form Ae^st.</span> </p><p><span m='1400000'>And if you think
  you've seen that before, yes,</span> <span m='1403000'>you have seen it many
  times before.</span> </p><p><span m='1406000'>And you will see it again, again
  and again.</span> </p><p><span m='1410000'>And we need to find A and s. We
  want to form the</span> <span m='1414000'>characteristic equation, find the
  roots of the equation</span> <span m='1419000'>and then write down the general
  solution to the homogenous</span> <span m='1424000'>equation as this. Same old
  same old.</span> </p><p><span m='1427000'>Let me just walk through the steps
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1430000'>Step A, assume a solution to the form
  Ae^st.</span> </p><p><span m='1434000'>And so I substitute Ae^st as my
  tentative solution to the</span> <span m='1439000'>equation. Again, let me
  remind you that</span> <span m='1444000'>the differential equations that we
  solve here are really easy</span> <span m='1448000'>because the way you solve
  them is you begin by assuming you</span> <span m='1452000'>know the solution
  and stick it in and find out what makes it</span> <span m='1457000'>work. I am
  going to stick Ae^st into</span> <span m='1459000'>this differential equation,
  and A comes out here.</span> </p><p><span m='1463000'>Differentiate this d
  squared, I get s squared down here,</span> <span m='1467000'>A s here and this
  simply gets stuck down here with the 1/LC</span> <span
  m='1471000'>coefficient. The next step I begin</span> <span
  m='1475000'>eliminating what I can, so I eliminate the A's,</span> <span
  m='1479000'>then eliminate the e^st's, and I end up with this equation</span>
  <span m='1484000'>here. I end up with this equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1487000'>This is my characteristic equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1490000'>It is an equation in s. Do people remember the</span> <span
  m='1494000'>characteristic equation we got for the LC circuit?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1500000'>Remember the Fineman trick? That's right,</span>
  <span m='1503000'>LC. S^2+1/LC=0.</span> </p><p><span m='1504000'>This thing
  wasn't there. All you do is simply follow the</span> <span m='1508000'>R. Just
  follow the R.</span> </p><p><span m='1510000'>Just imagine this is a dollar
  sign and kind of follow it.</span> </p><p><span m='1514000'>And you will see
  what the differences are between the LC</span> <span m='1519000'>and the RLC.
  So this is the characteristic</span> <span m='1522000'>equation. What I am
  going to do,</span> <span m='1524000'>iss much as I wrote the characteristic
  equation for the</span> <span m='1528000'>LC circuit, by substituting omega
  nought squared for 1/LC.</span> </p><p><span m='1535000'>Let me do the same
  thing here but introduce something for R</span> <span m='1539000'>and L as
  well. What I will do is let me give</span> <span m='1542000'>you this canonic
  form. The very first second-order</span> <span m='1546000'>equation I learned
  about when I was a kid was this one,</span> <span m='1550000'>S^2+2AS+B^2 or
  something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='1553000'>Let me write it in that
  form where I get 2 alpha s plus omega</span> <span m='1557000'>nought squared.
  Again, remember the alpha comes</span> <span m='1562000'>about because of R.
  So omega nought squared is 1/LC</span> <span m='1567000'>and alpha is RL/2.
  Omega nought squared is 1/LC</span> <span m='1571000'>and R/L is equal to two
  alpha. I am just writing this in a</span> <span m='1577000'>simpler form so
  that from now on going forward I am just going to</span> <span
  m='1582000'>deal with alphas and omega noughts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1587000'>Once I get to this characteristic equation,</span> <span
  m='1589000'>after that I can give you one generic way of solving it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1592000'>And depending on the kind of circuit you have,</span>
  <span m='1595000'>a series RLC, which is what we have,</span> <span
  m='1597000'>or a parallel RLC we will simply get different</span> <span
  m='1600000'>coefficients for the alpha term. This is going to stay the
  same</span> <span m='1604000'>but this term will look different, alpha is
  going to</span> <span m='1607000'>look different. There is a real pattern
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1610000'>And what I am doing is simply focusing
  on what is important,</span> <span m='1613000'>what the differences are
  between the pattern.</span> </p><p><span m='1616000'>You learned the LC
  situation and the RLC situation.</span> </p><p><span m='1621000'>Given this I
  can now write down, I am just simply replacing</span> <span m='1624000'>this
  as my characteristic equation in dealing with alphas</span> <span
  m='1628000'>and omegas. I will give you a physical</span> <span
  m='1630000'>significance of alpha in a little bit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1632000'>Do you remember the physical significance of omega nought?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1636000'>That was the oscillation frequency.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1638000'>In other words, given an inductor and</span> <span
  m='1640000'>capacitor, you put some charge on the capacitor and you
  watch</span> <span m='1644000'>it, it will oscillate. And its oscillation
  frequency</span> <span m='1647000'>will be one by a square root of LC.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1651000'>The magnitude of the initial conditions will
  determine how</span> <span m='1655000'>high are the oscillations or what the
  phase is in terms of</span> <span m='1660000'>when it starts, but the
  frequency is going to</span> <span m='1663000'>be the same. Step three, to
  solve the</span> <span m='1666000'>homogenous equation, is find the roots of
  the</span> <span m='1670000'>equation, s1 and s2, and here are my
  roots.</span> </p><p><span m='1673000'>Good old roots for a
  second-order,</span> <span m='1676000'>little s squared equation here.
  Finally, given that I have the</span> <span m='1682000'>roots, I can write
  down the general homogenous solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1686000'>So
  general solution is simply A1e^s1t, A2e^s2t.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1689000'>That's it. That's the solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1692000'>This looks big and corny, but we are going to make some</span>
  <span m='1696000'>simplifications as we go along and show that it ends up
  boiling</span> <span m='1700000'>down to something cos omega t. The math is
  kind of involved</span> <span m='1705000'>but we get down to something very
  simple, a cosine.</span> </p><p><span m='1710000'>Hold this general solution.
  From that, as a step three of</span> <span m='1714000'>the differential
  equation solution, I write the total</span> <span m='1718000'>solution down.
  And my total solution is the</span> <span m='1722000'>sum of the particular
  and the homogenous, so therefore I get</span> <span m='1727000'>this. VI was
  my particular and this</span> <span m='1729000'>term here is my homogenous
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1732000'>Now, if I wasn't doing circuits and
  simply trying to solve this</span> <span m='1737000'>mathematically here is
  what I would do.</span> </p><p><span m='1742000'>I would find the unknown from
  the initial conditions,</span> <span m='1746000'>so I know that v(0)=0. And so
  therefore if I</span> <span m='1749000'>substitute zero for V(0) I get
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='1752000'>If I substitute zero here, t is 0, t is
  0,</span> <span m='1755000'>so I simply get V1+A1+A2. And let me just blast
  through</span> <span m='1759000'>because I am going to redo this
  differently.</span> </p><p><span m='1762000'>i=Cdv/dt. And so that's what I
  get.</span> </p><p><span m='1765000'>I substitute zero and this is what I
  would get.</span> </p><p><span m='1770000'>I hurried through this. Don't
  worry.</span> </p><p><span m='1772000'>I'm going to do it again. If you just
  do it</span> <span m='1775000'>mathematically, you can solve this
  equation</span> <span m='1777000'>here and these two simultaneous equations in
  a1 and a2 and get</span> <span m='1782000'>the coefficients and you are
  done.</span> </p><p><span m='1784000'>But it doesn't give us a whole lot of
  insight into the behavior</span> <span m='1788000'>of these terms here. What I
  am going to do for now</span> <span m='1791000'>is kind of ignore that. Ignore
  I did that and instead</span> <span m='1795000'>try to go down a path that is
  a little bit more intuitive.</span> </p><p><span m='1800000'>Let's stare at
  this expression we got for the total solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1805000'>That is the expression we got. All I did is,</span> <span
  m='1809000'>I had alpha in there, I simply pulled out the alpha</span> <span
  m='1813000'>outside. So this is my total solution,</span> <span
  m='1817000'>V1-A1e^(-alpha t) something else and something else.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1821000'>Three cases to consider depending on the relative
  values</span> <span m='1826000'>of alpha and omega nought. If alpha is greater
  than omega</span> <span m='1832000'>nought then I get a real quantity
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1835000'>The square root of a positive number, I
  get a real number,</span> <span m='1840000'>and that number will add up to the
  minus alpha and I am going</span> <span m='1845000'>to get a solution that
  will look like, oh, I'm sorry.</span> </p><p><span m='1849000'>Let me just do
  it a little differently.</span> </p><p><span m='1853000'>There are three
  situations here.</span> </p><p><span m='1855000'>One is alpha greater than
  omega nought.</span> </p><p><span m='1860000'>Alpha equal to omega nought.
  Alpha less than omega nought.</span> </p><p><span m='1864000'>Alpha is
  greater, alpha is less,</span> <span m='1866000'>alpha is equal to this term
  inside the square root sign.</span> </p><p><span m='1870000'>For reasons you
  will understand shortly, we call this</span> <span m='1874000'>"overdamped"
  case, the "underdamped" case and the</span> <span m='1878000'>"critically
  damped" case. When alpha is greater than</span> <span m='1882000'>omega nought
  this term gives me a real number,</span> <span m='1886000'>and I get something
  as simple as this.</span> </p><p><span m='1890000'>Remember, for the series
  RLC circuit, alpha was R/2L.</span> </p><p><span m='1893000'>So if R is big,
  in other words,</span> <span m='1896000'>if in my RLC circuit R is huge then I
  am going to get this</span> <span m='1900000'>situation. My output voltage on
  the</span> <span m='1903000'>capacitor is going to look like this, the sum of
  two</span> <span m='1907000'>exponentials. And if I were to plot it
  very</span> <span m='1910000'>quickly for you, for a VI step,</span> <span
  m='1912000'>V would look like this. So v would simply look like</span> <span
  m='1916000'>this because it is the sum of a couple of exponentials.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1922000'>All right. Now, alpha is positive here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1924000'>Remember alpha1 and alpha2 are both positive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1928000'>These two added up, because of this constant
  VI,</span> <span m='1931000'>give rise to something that increases in the
  following</span> <span m='1935000'>manner. Let's look at the situation</span>
  <span m='1938000'>where alpha is less than omega nought, where the term
  inside</span> <span m='1942000'>the square root sign is negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1944000'>What I can do is pull the negative sign out and
  express it</span> <span m='1949000'>this way. What I am going to do is
  since</span> <span m='1952000'>alpha is less than omega nought, I am going to
  reverse these two</span> <span m='1956000'>and pull out square root of minus
  one to the outside.</span> </p><p><span m='1960000'>This is what I get. I am
  just playing around with</span> <span m='1963000'>this so that whatever is
  under the square root sign ends up</span> <span m='1967000'>giving me a
  positive real number.</span> </p><p><span m='1969000'>So I pull the j outside
  and this is what I get.</span> </p><p><span m='1972000'>Now, let me blast
  through a bunch of math and end up with</span> <span m='1975000'>something
  very, very simple for this</span> <span m='1977000'>underdamped case. Let me
  define a few other</span> <span m='1982000'>terms. I am going to call omega
  nought</span> <span m='1985000'>minus alpha squared the square root of
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='1989000'>I am going to call it omega d. And here
  is what I get.</span> </p><p><span m='1994000'>So I have defined three things
  for you now, alpha,</span> <span m='1998000'>omega nought and omega d. And I
  get this equation in</span> <span m='2003000'>terms of alpha and omega d. And
  then, remember from your</span> <span m='2008000'>good-old Euler relationship?
  e to the j omega d is simply</span> <span m='2014000'>cosine plus a j sine. I
  am just going to blast</span> <span m='2017000'>through a bunch of math rather
  quickly.</span> </p><p><span m='2020000'>Once I replace this in terms of a
  cosine and sine,</span> <span m='2024000'>cosine and a j sine and then collect
  all the coefficients</span> <span m='2028000'>together, I get an equation of
  the form VI plus some constant e</span> <span m='2032000'>to the minus alpha
  t, cosine, the sum of the constant</span> <span m='2036000'>e to the minus
  alpha t, sine.</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>Remember the sines and cosines
  are coming out,</span> <span m='2042000'>but because of my R I am getting this
  funny alpha here,</span> <span m='2046000'>e to the minus alpha here. So I am
  getting sums of sine</span> <span m='2049000'>and cosine. And K1 and K2 are
  some</span> <span m='2051000'>constants which I will need to determine for my
  initial</span> <span m='2055000'>conditions. I am going to continue on
  with</span> <span m='2057000'>this and keep on simplifying it because, as I
  promised you,</span> <span m='2061000'>I want to get to something that is just
  a cosine.</span> </p><p><span m='2064000'>I want to go down this path. I am
  not going to cover this</span> <span m='2067000'>case, the critically damped
  case.</span> </p><p><span m='2071000'>And I will touch upon it later but not
  dwell on it.</span> </p><p><span m='2074000'>Let me continue down the path of
  the underdamped case,</span> <span m='2079000'>and this is what we have.
  Continuing with the math,</span> <span m='2083000'>let's start with the
  initial conditions, v nought equals</span> <span m='2087000'>zero, and that
  gives me K1 is simply -VI.</span> </p><p><span m='2090000'>So at v(0)=0 t is
  zero, so this terms goes away,</span> <span m='2094000'>the cosine becomes a
  1, e^(alpha t) goes away,</span> <span m='2098000'>and K1=-VI. Then I know
  that i(0) and i is</span> <span m='2104000'>simply Cdv/dt. And I get this
  nasty</span> <span m='2108000'>expression. I substitute t=0 and I get</span>
  <span m='2113000'>something that looks like this. I know what K1 is,</span>
  <span m='2120000'>and so therefore K2 is simply -V1alpha divided by
  omega</span> <span m='2127000'>nought. I have taken this expression</span>
  <span m='2131000'>where the unknowns K1 and K2 are to be found.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2134000'>I set the initial conditions down at t=0 and I get K1
  and K2</span> <span m='2139000'>as follows, which gives me the following
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='2142000'>This is the solution I get where I
  do not have any unknowns</span> <span m='2146000'>anymore. Remember that omega
  d and alpha</span> <span m='2149000'>are directly related to circuit
  parameters.</span> </p><p><span m='2152000'>Alpha was R/2L and omega d was
  square root of alpha squared</span> <span m='2156000'>minus omega nought
  squared. ** omega d = sqrt(alpha^2 -</span> <span m='2159000'>omega_0^2) **
  And omega nought squared was 1</span> <span m='2164000'>by square root of LC.
  So I know it all now.</span> </p><p><span m='2167000'>I still have sines and
  cosines here, so I am going to simplify</span> <span m='2172000'>this a little
  further. Oh, before I go on to do that,</span> <span m='2177000'>let's do the
  Fineman trick again and notice if I am still</span> <span m='2181000'>true to
  the LC circuit I did the last time.</span> </p><p><span m='2185000'>Remember
  when R goes to zero alpha goes to zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2190000'>Because alpha is R divided by 2L.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2193000'>If alpha was zero what happens? If alpha was zero,</span> <span
  m='2198000'>this guy goes to one, this whole term goes to zero</span> <span
  m='2203000'>and omega dt now ends up becoming omega nought,</span> <span
  m='2208000'>and I get this term here. I get VI-VIcosine(omega t),</span> <span
  m='2213000'>which is exactly what I expected in my equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2220000'>This is the same as the LC case that I got.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2227000'>Let's go back to this situation and simply if
  further.</span> </p><p><span m='2237000'>If you look at Appendix B.7 in your
  course notes,</span> <span m='2245000'>Appendix B.7 is a quick tutorial on
  trig.</span> </p><p><span m='2254000'>And in that trig tutorial you will see
  that,</span> <span m='2257000'>and you have probably seen this before, too,
  multiple times,</span> <span m='2261000'>the scaled sum of sines are also
  sines.</span> </p><p><span m='2263000'>This is an incredibly cool fact of
  sinusoids.</span> </p><p><span m='2267000'>If you take two sinusoids of the
  same frequency and you scale</span> <span m='2271000'>them up in any which way
  and add them up you also end up with a</span> <span m='2275000'>sinusoid. It
  is hard to believe but it is</span> <span m='2278000'>true. It is an
  incredible property of</span> <span m='2282000'>sinusoids. Take any two
  sinusoids,</span> <span m='2284000'>scale them in any way you like, same
  frequency,</span> <span m='2287000'>add them up, you will get a
  sinusoid.</span> </p><p><span m='2290000'>What that is saying is that, look,
  here is a sinusoid,</span> <span m='2293000'>here is a sinusoidal function,
  and I am scaling them up in</span> <span m='2297000'>some manner. So I should
  be able to add them</span> <span m='2301000'>up and be able to express that as
  single sine.</span> </p><p><span m='2304000'>And to be sure you can, look at
  the Appendix,</span> <span m='2307000'>and there is an expression for a1 sinX
  plus a2 cosX is equal to</span> <span m='2311000'>a cosine of blah, blah,
  blah.</span> </p><p><span m='2315000'>This is what you get. No magic
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2318000'>Just math. From here I directly get
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='2322000'>And look at what I have. It is
  absolutely unbelievable.</span> </p><p><span m='2327000'>v(t) is simply VI,
  there is a constant here,</span> <span m='2331000'>this an e to the minus
  alpha term and there is a cosine.</span> </p><p><span m='2338000'>Again, to
  pull the Fineman trick, if this alpha were to go</span> <span m='2342000'>to
  zero here then you would end up with the expression you had</span> <span
  m='2346000'>for the LC situation. Let's stare at this a little</span> <span
  m='2350000'>while longer. There is a constant plus a</span> <span
  m='2352000'>minus, a cosine term, so there is a sinusoid at the</span> <span
  m='2356000'>output, and there is an e to the minus alpha which ends up
  giving</span> <span m='2361000'>you the decay you have seen before.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2363000'>In other words, to a step input,</span> <span
  m='2365000'>the LC circuit would give you a sinusoid.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2370000'>That is what the LC circuit would do if alpha was zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2374000'>But because of this alpha term here, e to the minus
  alpha t,</span> <span m='2379000'>that gives rise to a damping effect, so this
  causes this</span> <span m='2383000'>thing to become smaller and smaller as
  time goes by until</span> <span m='2388000'>this term goes to zero at t equals
  infinity.</span> </p><p><span m='2391000'>This guy damps down and so therefore
  you end up getting the</span> <span m='2396000'>curve that you saw like this.
  Twenty minutes of juggling math</span> <span m='2402000'>solving a
  second-order differential equation,</span> <span m='2406000'>but what ends up
  is the same sinusoid but it is damped in the</span> <span
  m='2411000'>following manner such that the frequency, rather the
  amplitude</span> <span m='2417000'>keeps decaying until it starts off at zero
  and then settles</span> <span m='2422000'>down at vI. This is exactly what you
  saw in</span> <span m='2425000'>the demo that we showed you earlier.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2430000'>The critically damped case, I am not going to do it
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2434000'>I am going to point you to the following
  insight.</span> </p><p><span m='2437000'>The underdamped case looked like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='2440000'>It was a sinusoid that kind of decayed
  out.</span> </p><p><span m='2443000'>That is the underdamped case. And then I
  showed you the</span> <span m='2447000'>overdamped case. The overdamped case
  looked like</span> <span m='2451000'>this. And, as you might expect,</span>
  <span m='2453000'>the critically damped case is kind of in the middle and
  looks</span> <span m='2458000'>like this. So the overdamped case would</span>
  <span m='2462000'>look like this, underdamped like this,</span> <span
  m='2464000'>and the critically damped case kind of goes up and kind of</span>
  <span m='2469000'>settles down almost immediately. This is when alpha equals
  omega</span> <span m='2474000'>nought. I won't do that case here,</span> <span
  m='2476000'>but I will simply point you to Section 13.2.3.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2479000'>Just to tie things together, recall this demo here that we</span>
  <span m='2484000'>showed you in class yesterday. This is exactly the kind
  of</span> <span m='2488000'>form of the sinusoid you saw because of that input
  step.</span> </p><p><span m='2494000'>If you want to see a complete analysis
  of inverter pairs and</span> <span m='2499000'>look at the delays and so on
  because of that,</span> <span m='2503000'>you can look at Page 170 and example
  898.</span> </p><p><span m='2506000'>In the next five or six minutes, what I
  would like to do</span> <span m='2511000'>is stare at the RLC circuit. And
  much like I showed you some</span> <span m='2516000'>intuitive methods to get
  the RC response, what we are going to</span> <span m='2521000'>do is do the
  same thing for the RLC.</span> </p><p><span m='2526000'>In the RLC situation,
  much like the RC situation,</span> <span m='2529000'>experts don't go around
  writing 15 pages of differential</span> <span m='2533000'>equations and
  solving them each time they see an RLC circuit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2538000'>They stare at it and boom, the response pops out,</span> <span
  m='2541000'>the sketch pops out. This one is going to be another</span> <span
  m='2545000'>one like our Bend it Like Beckham series here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2550000'>And this one is in honor of Leslie Kolodziejski.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2554000'>And I call it "Konquer it like Kolodziejski".</span>
  </p><p><span m='2558000'>Again, as I said, experts don't go around
  solving</span> <span m='2562000'>long differential equations and spending ten
  pages of notes</span> <span m='2567000'>trying to get a sinusoid. They look at
  a circuit and</span> <span m='2571000'>sketch response. I am going to show you
  how to</span> <span m='2575000'>do that, too. And what you can do is,</span>
  <span m='2579000'>to practice, go to Websim and try out</span> <span
  m='2582000'>various combinations of inputs and initial conditions and</span>
  <span m='2586000'>sketch it, time yourself, give yourself 30 seconds or
  a</span> <span m='2590000'>minute if you like, and sketch it and check
  it</span> <span m='2593000'>against the Websim response. If it doesn't match
  either you</span> <span m='2598000'>are wrong or there is a bug in
  Websim.</span> </p><p><span m='2600000'>What I am going to do is, the response
  to the critically</span> <span m='2604000'>damped and underdamped case was
  very easy to sketch out.</span> </p><p><span m='2610000'>You started with an
  initial condition, you settled at VI and</span> <span m='2613000'>just kind of
  drew it like that. The interesting case is the</span> <span
  m='2616000'>underdamped case, and that is what I am going to</span> <span
  m='2619000'>dwell on. Before we go on and I show you</span> <span
  m='2621000'>the intuitive method, as a first step I would like to</span> <span
  m='2625000'>build some intuition. Let's stare at this response</span> <span
  m='2627000'>here and try to understand what is going on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2630000'>This is the response that we saw.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2632000'>And this fact that you see an oscillation happening is also</span>
  <span m='2635000'>called "ringing". You say that your circuit is</span> <span
  m='2638000'>ringing. All right.</span> </p><p><span m='2640000'>You see some
  interesting facts. You see that frequency of the</span> <span
  m='2644000'>ringing is given by omega d. This cosine omega d,</span> <span
  m='2648000'>so that is the frequency omega d.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2650000'>So the time is 2 pi divided by omega d.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2653000'>The oscillation frequency is omega d, but omega d is simply</span>
  <span m='2657000'>omega nought squared minus alpha squared.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2660000'>Once you have a big value of R alpha becomes very
  small and</span> <span m='2664000'>omega d is very commonly equal to, very
  close to omega nought.</span> </p><p><span m='2670000'>So omega d and omega
  nought very commonly are very close</span> <span m='2674000'>together. And
  when that happens this</span> <span m='2677000'>frequency is directly omega
  nought.</span> </p><p><span m='2680000'>Alpha governs how quickly your
  sinusoid decays.</span> </p><p><span m='2683000'>e to the alpha t here is the
  envelope that governs how</span> <span m='2688000'>quickly my sinusoid decays.
  And notice that each of these</span> <span m='2692000'>terms, alpha and omega
  nought, comes directly from my</span> <span m='2696000'>characteristic
  equation. Which means that once you get</span> <span m='2701000'>your
  characteristic equation you really don't have to do much</span> <span
  m='2705000'>else. And up until now you still have</span> <span m='2707000'>to
  write the differential equation to get the</span> <span
  m='2710000'>characteristic equation, so you still have to do some</span> <span
  m='2714000'>differential equation stuff, but in two lectures I am going</span>
  <span m='2717000'>to show you a way that you can even write down the</span>
  <span m='2720000'>characteristic equation by inspection.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2723000'>Look at your circuit and boom, in 15 seconds or less write</span>
  <span m='2726000'>down the characteristic equation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2730000'>It is absolutely unbelievable. What are the other factors
  that</span> <span m='2734000'>are interesting here? Of course I need to find
  out</span> <span m='2737000'>initial values. I start off at zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2739000'>This is my capacitor voltage. If I don't have an
  infinite</span> <span m='2743000'>spike or an impulse my capacitor voltage
  tries to stay where it</span> <span m='2748000'>is and starts off at zero. And
  the final value is given by</span> <span m='2751000'>VI, the capacitor is a
  long-term open so therefore VI appears</span> <span m='2756000'>across the
  capacitor. In the long-term my final value</span> <span m='2759000'>is going
  to be VI. There is one other interesting</span> <span m='2764000'>parameter,
  which I will simply define today but dwell on about</span> <span m='2769000'>a
  week from today, and that is called the Q.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2772000'>Some of you may have heard the term oh, that's a high Q</span>
  <span m='2777000'>circuit. Q is an indication of how ringy</span> <span
  m='2780000'>the circuit is. And Q is defined as omega</span> <span
  m='2783000'>nought by 2 alpha. It is called the "quality</span> <span
  m='2787000'>factor". And it turns out that Q is</span> <span
  m='2790000'>approximately the number of cycles of ringing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2793000'>So if you have a high Q you ring for a long time and if you</span>
  <span m='2797000'>have a low Q you ring for a very short time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2799000'>That is called the quality factor defined by omega
  nought</span> <span m='2803000'>by 2 alpha. Notice that Q,</span> <span
  m='2804000'>omega nought, alpha, omega d,</span> <span m='2806000'>all of
  these come from the terms in the characteristic</span> <span
  m='2810000'>equation. We will spend more time on Q</span> <span
  m='2812000'>later. With this insight here is how I</span> <span
  m='2814000'>can go about very quickly sketching out the form of the</span>
  <span m='2818000'>response. Here is my circuit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2821000'>I want to sketch the form of the response for a step input
  at</span> <span m='2825000'>vI. Zero to vI step input here,</span> <span
  m='2828000'>I want to find out what happens at this point.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2831000'>This is described to you in a lot more detail in Section
  13.8</span> <span m='2836000'>in your course notes. Let's go through the
  steps.</span> </p><p><span m='2839000'>Let's do the really simple situation
  first.</span> </p><p><span m='2843000'>Let's also assume for fun that you are
  given that v(0) starts</span> <span m='2847000'>out being some positive value.
  Some v(0) which is a positive</span> <span m='2853000'>number. And, to make it
  harder on</span> <span m='2855000'>ourselves, let's say i(0) starts out being
  some negative number.</span> </p><p><span m='2859000'>So i(0) is some negative
  current.</span> </p><p><span m='2862000'>The first thing I know is v(0), the
  capacitor voltage starts</span> <span m='2866000'>out here, which can change
  suddenly.</span> </p><p><span m='2868000'>And I also know that in the
  long-term this is an open</span> <span m='2872000'>circuit. So that this
  voltage vI will</span> <span m='2875000'>appear directly across the capacitor
  in the long-term.</span> </p><p><span m='2880000'>So I get starting out at
  v(0), ending at vI,</span> <span m='2883000'>I am also half the way there. I
  know the initial and ending</span> <span m='2887000'>point of the curve. And
  then I know that somewhere</span> <span m='2890000'>in here there must be some
  funny gyrations here,</span> <span m='2893000'>because remember I am dealing
  with the underdamped case.</span> </p><p><span m='2897000'>And you can
  determine that from alpha and omega nought.</span> </p><p><span m='2901000'>If
  alpha is less than omega nought, you know that you are in</span> <span
  m='2905000'>the underdamped case and this is what you get.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2910000'>Let's compute and write the characteristic equation down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2913000'>A week from today you will write it by
  inspection,</span> <span m='2917000'>but for now you will do it by writing
  down a differential</span> <span m='2920000'>equation. And from the
  characteristic</span> <span m='2923000'>equation you will get omega d, you
  will get alpha,</span> <span m='2926000'>omega nought and Q. So omega d gives
  you the</span> <span m='2929000'>frequency of oscillations. My frequency of
  oscillation is</span> <span m='2933000'>now known. From Q I know how long
  it</span> <span m='2935000'>rings, because I know it rings for about Q
  cycles.</span> </p><p><span m='2940000'>I know that ringing stops
  approximately here.</span> </p><p><span m='2942000'>And then I know that
  between that the start and end point my</span> <span m='2946000'>curve kind of
  looks like this, something like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2950000'>Right
  there we are 95% of the way there.</span> </p><p><span m='2952000'>The only
  question is I do not know if it goes like this or it</span> <span
  m='2956000'>goes like this. I am not quite sure yet if it</span> <span
  m='2959000'>starts off going high or starts off going low.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2962000'>Not quite clear. I also do not know what the</span> <span
  m='2965000'>maximum amplitude is. It turns out this is rather</span> <span
  m='2970000'>complicated to determine so we won't deal with that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2974000'>Just simply so you can draw a rough sketch.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2977000'>The questions is which way does it start?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2980000'>I could leave it for you to think about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2983000'>Yeah, let me do that. It is given on this page
  so</span> <span m='2987000'>don't look at it. Think about it,</span> <span
  m='2990000'>and think about how you can determine whether it goes up or</span>
  <span m='2995000'>down. It turns out that in this case</span> <span
  m='2997000'>it is going to down and then ring.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3002000'>See if you can figure it out for yourselves and then we
  will</span> <span m='3006000'>talk about it next week.</span> </p>
