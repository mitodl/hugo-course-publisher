transcript: >-
  <p><span m='0'>Good morning. OK.</span> <span m='1300'>Why is it so much
  lower?</span> <span m='4000'>The topic for today is Energy and Power.</span>
  <span m='24000'>Most of the time this semester, up to now at least,</span>
  <span m='28000'>we focused a lot on speed. We have been truly speed
  freaks</span> <span m='32000'>looking at how fast can we switch the
  signal,</span> <span m='36000'>what does a time domain waveform look
  like?</span> <span m='39000'>We also looked at frequency responses of
  circuits.</span> <span m='44000'>This week we will spend on something a little
  bit</span> <span m='48000'>different, and that relates to energy and
  power.</span> <span m='53000'>Energy and power is gaining a lot more
  importance in certainly</span> <span m='57000'>this decade, and will do so in
  the future.</span> <span m='60000'>And I am going to work out a little example
  towards the end</span> <span m='64000'>of the lecture. And there you will see
  that if</span> <span m='68000'>you do things naively, your handheld
  devices,</span> <span m='71000'>your cell phone, laptops and so on will just
  up</span> <span m='74000'>and explode. You have got to be a little bit</span>
  <span m='78000'>careful in terms of how to manage energy and power.</span>
  <span m='81000'>Before I get into that, I just want to wrap up with a</span>
  <span m='85000'>quick review of what we covered last week.</span> <span
  m='95000'>We ended last week by looking at positive feedback in analog</span>
  <span m='99000'>circuits using an op amp. And, in particular,</span> <span
  m='103000'>we built an oscillator.</span> <span m='111000'>We built an
  oscillator that allowed us to charge a</span> <span m='115000'>capacitor. And
  when the voltage across the</span> <span m='118000'>capacitor equaled that at
  the minus terminal it would flip and</span> <span m='122000'>keep doing so.
  And at the output you would get</span> <span m='126000'>a waveform that looked
  like this.</span> <span m='128000'>You would get a square wave output.</span>
  <span m='131000'>Now, throughout the course we have talked about getting
  square</span> <span m='136000'>wave inputs. And this is one example of
  how</span> <span m='139000'>you can actually produce a square wave pretty much
  from</span> <span m='143000'>first principles using a capacitor, resistors and
  an op</span> <span m='147000'>amp. Now, I just wanted to wrap up</span> <span
  m='151000'>this little item here by talking about one application of an</span>
  <span m='156000'>oscillator. And this application of the</span> <span
  m='160000'>oscillator really nicely closed the loop on the body of</span>
  <span m='164000'>knowledge relating to digital circuits that we have covered
  in</span> <span m='170000'>this course. What I want to talk about</span> <span
  m='173000'>briefly is a small digital system with a sender and a</span> <span
  m='178000'>receiver. And the sender is sending a</span> <span
  m='182000'>signal, the receiver receives a signal, and in this course
  we</span> <span m='187000'>have talked about senders sending a sequence of
  ones and</span> <span m='192000'>zeros. Say, for example,</span> <span
  m='194000'>the sender wants to send some sort of a signal like this.</span>
  <span m='199000'>We have seen that this is quite a legitimate signal.</span>
  <span m='203000'>We get some kind of oscillatory behavior because of
  the</span> <span m='208000'>inductance and capacitance associated with the
  wire.</span> <span m='214000'>And what you have done is that you pretty much
  believed me when</span> <span m='217000'>I said that this really corresponds
  to a one,</span> <span m='220000'>one, zero. The sender wants to send a
  one,</span> <span m='222000'>one, zero signal to the receiver, and the
  receiver gets</span> <span m='225000'>it. So this is a one,</span> <span
  m='226000'>this is a one, this is a zero.</span> <span m='228000'>But if I am
  a receiver, I am going to look at the</span> <span m='231000'>square wave.
  There is no such thing as</span> <span m='233000'>sending a one on a wire. You
  cannot send a one on a</span> <span m='236000'>wire. You send a voltage signal
  or a</span> <span m='238000'>current signal on a wire. So, the receiver
  receives a</span> <span m='242000'>voltage signal. It is going to be zero for
  some</span> <span m='245000'>time and then maybe 5 volts or 3 volts or
  whatever is your high</span> <span m='249000'>and then zero again. How does my
  receiver know it's</span> <span m='253000'>a one, one, zero? Why can't it be a
  one,</span> <span m='255000'>one, one, one, zero, zero, zero?</span> <span
  m='257000'>It doesn't know. How does the receiver know it's</span> <span
  m='260000'>a one, one, zero sequence and not 50 ones followed by 40</span>
  <span m='264000'>zeros? It doesn't know.</span> <span m='265000'>What we need
  is -- For senders to be able to</span> <span m='269000'>communicate with
  receivers, we need some kind of agreed</span> <span m='274000'>upon time when
  receivers sample the signal coming in and decide</span> <span
  m='278000'>whether it's a one or a zero. They both have to agree on</span>
  <span m='283000'>certain time bases when to look at the input.</span> <span
  m='286000'>One way to deal with this is I can have a clock,</span> <span
  m='290000'>a square wave signal that we call a clock in digital systems</span>
  <span m='294000'>and ship it to the other side in the following manner.</span>
  <span m='306000'>This clock signal can be applied to this sender and to</span>
  <span m='310000'>this receiver. For more details on this,</span> <span
  m='314000'>let me recommend Page 735 of the course notes that talks</span>
  <span m='318000'>about a detailed example of the use of a clock in a
  digital</span> <span m='323000'>system. What I can do is create a clock</span>
  <span m='327000'>that looks like the square wave. The clock provides a notion
  of</span> <span m='333000'>time to the circuit. And I have some kind of a
  clock</span> <span m='336000'>signal generator. And I connect that to
  the</span> <span m='339000'>sender and connect that to the receiver.</span>
  <span m='342000'>And now both the receiver and the sender have a notion
  of</span> <span m='346000'>time. And what I can do is I can tell</span> <span
  m='348000'>my receiver, the sender and the receiver can have an
  agreement</span> <span m='353000'>between them that says that look at the
  signal at your input when</span> <span m='357000'>on the rising edge of the
  clock. Whenever the clock rises,</span> <span m='363000'>when you see a rising
  edge look at the value in the wire and</span> <span m='367000'>that's the
  value I sent. By doing so,</span> <span m='370000'>what I can do is that the
  receiver can look at the signal.</span> <span m='375000'>At this rising edge
  it sees a zero, this is vOH,</span> <span m='379000'>looks up here, sees a one
  here,</span> <span m='381000'>sees a one here and sees a zero.</span> <span
  m='384000'>So, it correctly sampled one, one, zero at the receiving
  end.</span> <span m='390000'>And the sender can send the same sequence here
  once we have</span> <span m='394000'>this time base. This little brief
  foray</span> <span m='397000'>circuits was simply to give you an application
  of a circuit that</span> <span m='401000'>can produce a square wave. I can
  create a clock with a</span> <span m='405000'>time base. Also, interestingly
  much more</span> <span m='408000'>fundamental is we looked at various
  abstractions throughout</span> <span m='412000'>the course. We talked about
  discretizing</span> <span m='415000'>space by looking at lumped
  signals.</span> <span m='419000'>What I also want to point out is that a clock
  can be viewed as</span> <span m='423000'>another fundamental abstraction in
  the digital domain where what</span> <span m='427000'>I am doing is
  discretizing time. What I am saying is that,</span> <span m='431000'>look, in
  the digital domain we have already discretized value</span> <span
  m='435000'>into zeros and ones, but we still had continuous</span> <span
  m='439000'>time until now. And what you do in digital</span> <span
  m='442000'>systems is to say that look, let's digitize everything,</span>
  <span m='445000'>or rather discretize everything.</span> <span m='449000'>And
  let's discretize time as well into these points that</span> <span
  m='452000'>happen on the rising edge of the clock which means that the</span>
  <span m='456000'>circuit has meaning, signals have meaning only when</span>
  <span m='459000'>the clock is rising. That tends to discretize time</span>
  <span m='463000'>which means that I really don't care what happens to signals
  in</span> <span m='467000'>this time, as long as on the rising edge of the
  clock I get</span> <span m='471000'>the right value. This concept is
  called</span> <span m='473000'>discretizing time. And a clock lets you do
  that.</span> <span m='478000'>Remember that in digital systems, which you will
  learn</span> <span m='481000'>about in 004 I am really discretizing two
  things,</span> <span m='485000'>discretizing values into zeros and ones, and
  at the same time</span> <span m='490000'>also discretizing time into a time
  when I sample things and a</span> <span m='494000'>time when I ignore values
  on the wires.</span> <span m='497000'>I think you will get to clocks in 6.004
  after about a month,</span> <span m='501000'>so initially you would just be
  focusing on the statics of the</span> <span m='506000'>system without worrying
  about any dynamic clock introduced in</span> <span m='510000'>the circuit. OK,
  that's just a brief little</span> <span m='515000'>interlude. With that let me
  get into</span> <span m='518000'>today's topic of energy and power.</span>
  <span m='520000'>Why is this important? The reason this is important is</span>
  <span m='525000'>that what really determines the size of your handheld?</span>
  <span m='529000'>You may think oh, gee, electronics in the</span> <span
  m='532000'>handheld. Some of you may think,</span> <span m='535000'>oh, the
  antenna in the handheld.</span> <span m='537000'>No. What really,</span> <span
  m='539000'>really determines the size and weight of your handheld
  devices,</span> <span m='543000'>your PDAs, your cell phones, your laptops and
  so on is by</span> <span m='547000'>and large the battery. On Page 2 I have a
  little</span> <span m='550000'>cartoon that shows you that if we did not have
  you learn about</span> <span m='553000'>energy and power, that's what we would
  all be</span> <span m='556000'>doing in order to use cell phones.</span> <span
  m='558000'>Not surprisingly the very first wireless phones ended up in</span>
  <span m='562000'>automobiles because you had a big battery.</span> <span
  m='564000'>And so you had these wireless phones only in cars.</span> <span
  m='569000'>Because of a huge amount of research based on the knowledge,</span>
  <span m='572000'>the technologies I am going to talk about in today's
  lecture</span> <span m='576000'>and Thursday's lecture, you will see very
  simple and</span> <span m='580000'>elegant ways of reducing the amount of
  battery you need to be</span> <span m='584000'>able to get some kind of
  function out of analog or</span> <span m='587000'>digital devices. I also want
  you to take a look</span> <span m='590000'>at Page 2 of the handout that I
  have given you here,</span> <span m='594000'>handout 63. This handout talks
  about the</span> <span m='596000'>absolute latest in digital fabrication
  technology out</span> <span m='600000'>there. This is not a paid
  commercial</span> <span m='604000'>for IBM. IBM has a technology called</span>
  <span m='608000'>CU08. It is called Blue Logic.</span> <span m='611000'>It is
  called the Copper 08 Process.</span> <span m='614000'>And in this process, if
  you look down on Page 1,</span> <span m='619000'>for example, IBM claims that
  it can build up</span> <span m='623000'>to 72 million gates in a single
  chip.</span> <span m='628000'>With this technology they are able to build 70
  to 80 million</span> <span m='632000'>gates where a gate is, unless otherwise
  mentioned,</span> <span m='635000'>pretty much defined as a two input NAND
  gate equivalent.</span> <span m='639000'>So, your inverter, your NAND gate and
  so on count</span> <span m='642000'>as a gate. And they can build close to
  80</span> <span m='645000'>million of these little suckers on a single
  chip.</span> <span m='648000'>Just imagine that. And the biggest chip they
  can</span> <span m='651000'>build is on the order of 18 to 19 millimeters on a
  side,</span> <span m='655000'>roughly two centimeters on a side.</span> <span
  m='659000'>On a chip that's about one square inch.</span> <span m='662000'>You
  can put down 80 million gates.</span> <span m='664000'>What is more important
  for today is what is on Page 2,</span> <span m='669000'>actually. I have
  circled two things on</span> <span m='672000'>Page 2. One thing that I have
  circled</span> <span m='675000'>is power supply range in the 0.7 to 1.3
  volts.</span> <span m='679000'>Notice that that voltage, the power supply
  voltage for</span> <span m='683000'>these chips is significantly lower than
  the 5 volts that we</span> <span m='688000'>have been normally talking about
  in this course.</span> <span m='694000'>When in doubt our problems have used 5
  volts.</span> <span m='697000'>But notice that in this technology they're
  talking about</span> <span m='702000'>using voltages for the power supply VS
  in the range of 0.7 to</span> <span m='709000'>Well, you will find out. The
  second thing I've circled</span> <span m='713000'>is something called power
  dissipation.</span> <span m='717000'>And you say power dissipation is said to
  be 0.006 microwatts</span> <span m='721000'>per megahertz per gate. It says
  power dissipation is 6</span> <span m='727000'>nanowatts per megahertz per
  gate.</span> <span m='729000'>What that says is that each gate off your
  circuit will</span> <span m='733000'>dissipate this much power at a 1
  megahertz frequency.</span> <span m='737000'>And the implication of that is
  that you should be able to</span> <span m='741000'>convert that single number
  to the power dissipation in any</span> <span m='745000'>chip that you might
  build depending on the number of gates</span> <span m='749000'>that you have,
  the frequency you run the</span> <span m='752000'>circuit at, the voltage that
  you use and so on and so forth.</span> <span m='758000'>By the end of today's
  lecture you will be able to take this</span> <span m='761000'>number and
  correlate that into the power dissipation of any</span> <span m='764000'>chip
  that you might want to build with this.</span> <span m='767000'>That just
  serves as the motivation that by the end of</span> <span m='769000'>this
  lecture you will understand how to very quickly in five</span> <span
  m='773000'>seconds or less, boom, given a chip,</span> <span m='775000'>oh,
  yeah, that should consume about 30 watts of power.</span> <span m='779000'>And
  what you will also do, based on some examples here,</span> <span
  m='782000'>estimate the power of not the Pentium IV but a chip
  following</span> <span m='787000'>the Pentium VI, let's call it the Pentium
  V</span> <span m='790000'>would consume if it ran at 1 gigahertz.</span> <span
  m='793000'>We will come up with some absolutely shocking numbers</span> <span
  m='797000'>based on what you have learned. With that kind of motivation</span>
  <span m='801000'>let me get into talking about some theory and get into
  the</span> <span m='805000'>foundations of energy and power.</span> <span
  m='814000'>Let's go to Page 3.</span> <span m='826000'>To drive the
  theoretical discussion, I would like to</span> <span m='830000'>focus on the
  energy dissipated in a MOSFET gate.</span> <span m='834000'>And fundamentally
  we will talk about looking at energy and</span> <span m='839000'>power in
  circuits containing switches, resistors and</span> <span
  m='843000'>capacitors. The MOSFET gate is simply an</span> <span
  m='847000'>illustrative example to drive the theory.</span> <span
  m='850000'>But fundamentally what I am going to show you,</span> <span
  m='853000'>or lead you through today, I will tell you how to compute</span>
  <span m='857000'>the power and energy when you have capacitors,</span> <span
  m='861000'>resistors, voltage sources and switches in your circuit.</span>
  <span m='865000'>We will look at a circuit that looks like this.</span> <span
  m='868000'>Your vanilla inverter circuit.</span> <span m='888000'>My inverter.
  I apply some vIN signal here.</span> <span m='890000'>It could be a square
  wave. It could be some sequence of</span> <span m='894000'>ones and zeros. And
  this is an inverter that we</span> <span m='897000'>all know and love. And
  this guy here is,</span> <span m='899000'>stuck in a capacitor here. And this
  capacitor is meant to</span> <span m='904000'>model the input gate capacitance
  of whatever this inverter drives</span> <span m='910000'>plus any capacitance
  of the wire leading up to that gate and so</span> <span m='916000'>on. It is
  just a lumped capacitor</span> <span m='919000'>that I have stuck on there. I
  am interested in determining</span> <span m='924000'>a few things. One is what
  we call the standby</span> <span m='928000'>power. You will see all these
  terms</span> <span m='931000'>being used in cell phones and so on.</span>
  <span m='933000'>In your cell phone, your cell phone manufacturer</span> <span
  m='936000'>gives you two numbers. Of course both are over</span> <span
  m='939000'>exaggerations, but they give you two numbers</span> <span
  m='941000'>nonetheless. One number is the number of</span> <span
  m='944000'>days that the cell phone battery will last when in standby
  mode,</span> <span m='947000'>right? That's exactly where standby</span> <span
  m='949000'>comes from. In standby mode,</span> <span m='951000'>how much power
  does your cell phone or how long will the</span> <span m='954000'>battery
  last, that's the standby power.</span> <span m='958000'>And the second thing
  is what we call active use power.</span> <span m='962000'>Active use is when
  you are making a phone call and so on,</span> <span m='967000'>what is the
  power consumed? And there again your</span> <span m='971000'>manufacturer of
  your cell phone will give you a much smaller</span> <span m='977000'>number
  for the active use power of your cell phone.</span> <span m='981000'>What I am
  going to do is assume for discussion that the inverter</span> <span
  m='986000'>is driven by a square wave signal of the following sort.</span>
  <span m='993000'>This is vIN. And I am going to drive this</span> <span
  m='997000'>with a signal of this sort. The period applied at the</span> <span
  m='1004000'>input, so I am switching the inverter on and off,</span> <span
  m='1010000'>on and off, on and off. And T1 seconds for the high,</span> <span
  m='1016000'>T2 seconds for the low. This is the inverter,</span> <span
  m='1021000'>this is the input signal, and we'll keep coming back to</span>
  <span m='1026000'>that again and again. Rather than directly taking</span>
  <span m='1030000'>this circuit and analyzing its power, I would like to do
  things</span> <span m='1036000'>in a slightly roundabout manner. What I would
  like to do is show</span> <span m='1041000'>you some very simple circuits and
  analyze their standby and</span> <span m='1046000'>active powers. And then
  show you that this</span> <span m='1051000'>circuit simply is a combination of
  some of the simple things</span> <span m='1057000'>that you have seen. Example
  1.</span> <span m='1059000'>I would like to take a simple circuit that looks
  like this.</span> <span m='1065000'>A voltage source V applied across a
  resistor R,</span> <span m='1069000'>some current I. And if I apply a voltage
  across</span> <span m='1073000'>this resistor, that voltage would
  simply</span> <span m='1077000'>appear across the resistor. And the power is
  simply given</span> <span m='1083000'>by VI which is simply V squared divided
  by R.</span> <span m='1087000'>This is 6.002 101 in the very first
  chapter.</span> <span m='1091000'>That is the power that is dissipated by this
  resistor,</span> <span m='1096000'>simply V squared divided by R. That's the
  power dissipated by</span> <span m='1101000'>the resistor. Where does that
  power come</span> <span m='1105000'>from? The voltage source supplies
  the</span> <span m='1108000'>power. So, this guy here supplies this</span>
  <span m='1113000'>power and this guy here dissipates it.</span> <span
  m='1117000'>What is the energy that I dissipate in T time?</span> <span
  m='1121000'>Remember, power is the rate of energy dissipation.</span> <span
  m='1126000'>And so energy is simply power multiplied by time.</span> <span
  m='1132000'>For a circuit like this, energy dissipated in time T is</span>
  <span m='1137000'>simply VIT. For our gate remember we have</span> <span
  m='1142000'>two situations. We have VS, we have RL we have</span> <span
  m='1147000'>RON, vO and vIN. So, vIN is high.</span> <span m='1150000'>If vIN
  is high with respect to ground then RON,</span> <span m='1155000'>the switch
  is on, and this is the circuit that I</span> <span m='1159000'>see. In this
  situation the power</span> <span m='1162000'>consumed is simply V squared
  divided by the resistance here.</span> <span m='1170000'>It is simply VS
  squared divided by RL plus RON.</span> <span m='1178000'>Let me mark that with
  an asterisk.</span> <span m='1185000'>I will refer to this later. Similarly,
  when vIN is low the</span> <span m='1196000'>MOSFET is off. And the power is
  simply zero.</span> <span m='1202000'>I have no current flowing down and the
  power is zero.</span> <span m='1206000'>Absolutely basic stuff. Absolutely
  basic.</span> <span m='1209000'>So, the power, when I have the MOSFET
  on,</span> <span m='1212000'>for the kind of inverters you have seen so
  far,</span> <span m='1215000'>this is the power consumed by the
  inverter.</span> <span m='1219000'>And this asterisk here is simply to say
  hold that thought,</span> <span m='1223000'>we will get back to it a little
  later.</span> <span m='1226000'>Let me work out a second example.</span> <span
  m='1230000'>In this second example, I would like to consider the</span> <span
  m='1237000'>following circuit, a voltage source VS with a</span> <span
  m='1244000'>strange arrangement of switches, S1 with a resistance R1,</span>
  <span m='1252000'>a capacitor C in this manner, a switch S2 and a resistor
  R2.</span> <span m='1262000'>For now don't worry about how the circuit comes
  about.</span> <span m='1265000'>Just assume that I have drawn the circuit for
  you.</span> <span m='1268000'>And what I want to do is compute the power under
  certain</span> <span m='1272000'>conditions. Notice that if this is off
  and</span> <span m='1274000'>this is off, there is no current flowing either
  in this loop or</span> <span m='1278000'>this loop, and the power dissipated
  by the circuit is</span> <span m='1282000'>zero. But there are some
  arrangement</span> <span m='1284000'>of switches for which I do consume
  power.</span> <span m='1288000'>And so let me show you that arrangement of
  switches.</span> <span m='1293000'>And what I am going to do is assume that
  the switches open</span> <span m='1299000'>and close with the following
  periodic cycles.</span> <span m='1303000'>Let's assume that when this is high
  S1 is closed and S2 is</span> <span m='1309000'>open, and when this is low
  assume that S1 is open,</span> <span m='1315000'>S2 is closed. And let's
  assume this is T,</span> <span m='1319000'>this is T1, this is T2. That
  sequence should be</span> <span m='1324000'>reminiscent of this input that I
  am feeding to this inverter.</span> <span m='1329000'>All I am telling you
  here is that I am giving you the</span> <span m='1333000'>circuit. I want to
  compute the power</span> <span m='1335000'>consumption of the circuit. And
  what I am telling you is</span> <span m='1340000'>that with the frequency,
  with a time period of capital</span> <span m='1344000'>T, for the first T1
  seconds this switch is closed and that is</span> <span m='1348000'>open. So,
  this circuit applies.</span> <span m='1352000'>In the second half of the clock
  this switch is open so this</span> <span m='1359000'>circuit applies. And what
  I am interested in</span> <span m='1364000'>finding out is what is the energy
  dissipated in each cycle</span> <span m='1371000'>of time capital T? And I
  also want to find out the</span> <span m='1377000'>average power. Just spend
  about five seconds</span> <span m='1382000'>just staring at this and kind of
  intuit what is going on here.</span> <span m='1387000'>I start by putting a
  voltage source here and I close the</span> <span m='1391000'>switch. That is
  open.</span> <span m='1393000'>Start by closing this, what happens?</span>
  <span m='1396000'>When I close the switch VS is going to charge up this</span>
  <span m='1400000'>capacitor. I get current flowing through</span> <span
  m='1403000'>my resistor, so I am going to be charging up this capacitor
  here.</span> <span m='1410000'>Then let's say I allow T1 to be as large as
  possible,</span> <span m='1413000'>and so this capacitor is going to be
  charged up to all of VS.</span> <span m='1416000'>After a long time this guy
  gets to be VS in the capacitor.</span> <span m='1420000'>And as it is charging
  up I have current flow through the</span> <span m='1423000'>resistor, so it is
  sitting there dissipating power.</span> <span m='1426000'>Notice that this
  sucker does not dissipate energy.</span> <span m='1429000'>It simply stores
  energy. So, the energy supplied by the</span> <span m='1432000'>voltage source
  comes in, some of it gets stored in the</span> <span m='1435000'>capacitor and
  some of it is being dissipated by the</span> <span m='1438000'>resistor. That
  gets me to the end of T1.</span> <span m='1442000'>At the end of T2 I open the
  switch and close this switch.</span> <span m='1446000'>When I close the switch
  I have some energy on the capacitor,</span> <span m='1450000'>and the voltage
  across the capacitor begins to drive a</span> <span m='1453000'>current
  through this resistor R2.</span> <span m='1456000'>And now the capacitor
  supplies its stored energy,</span> <span m='1459000'>and its stored energy
  then begins to dissipate through</span> <span m='1463000'>resistor R2. And if
  T2 is very long then all</span> <span m='1466000'>the charge in the capacitor
  drains out.</span> <span m='1470000'>And the voltage in the capacitor at the
  end will be</span> <span m='1475000'>zero. So, that is just sort of a
  high</span> <span m='1478000'>level description of what goes on.</span> <span
  m='1482000'>Now let's go ahead and compute from first principles the</span>
  <span m='1487000'>energetics of this little circuit.</span> <span
  m='1491000'>Let's look at the entire period capital T, and as a first
  step</span> <span m='1497000'>look at T1. When T1 is in place S1 is</span>
  <span m='1503000'>closed and S2 is open. Accordingly,</span> <span
  m='1508000'>the circuit that applies looks like this.</span> <span
  m='1513000'>I have VS, S1 is closed, so that is closed,</span> <span
  m='1519000'>and I have this resistance R1, I have this capacitance C,</span>
  <span m='1526000'>some voltage VC across the capacitor.</span> <span
  m='1533000'>You can go ahead and assume that VC of zero is zero.</span> <span
  m='1537000'>That I start off my life with no voltage across the
  capacitor.</span> <span m='1543000'>First of all, let me plot the waveforms
  and</span> <span m='1547000'>write the expressions down and then compute the
  energy supplied</span> <span m='1553000'>by the voltage source and then look
  at where the energy goes.</span> <span m='1560000'>You all know, or should
  know by now,</span> <span m='1563000'>if I plot VC as a function of time,
  remember,</span> <span m='1567000'>this is really easy to do. VC as a function
  of time goes</span> <span m='1571000'>like this. At time T equal to zero I
  am</span> <span m='1575000'>telling you that the capacitor voltage is
  zero.</span> <span m='1579000'>I am telling you that. So, it is at
  zero.</span> <span m='1583000'>And then the capacitor charges up until it
  reaches VS.</span> <span m='1589000'>I also know that after a long time this
  will be VS,</span> <span m='1593000'>after a long time that will be VS, and
  between those two I have</span> <span m='1600000'>a rising function that looks
  like this.</span> <span m='1603000'>I can similarly plot the current for
  you.</span> <span m='1607000'>At time T equal to zero instantaneously the
  capacitor</span> <span m='1612000'>looks like a short, and so the current that
  I start</span> <span m='1617000'>off with is going to be VS divided by
  R1.</span> <span m='1623000'>The voltage across the capacitor is zero.</span>
  <span m='1626000'>All the voltage falls across the resistor R1.</span> <span
  m='1629000'>So, VS divided by R1 is the initial instantaneous current.</span>
  <span m='1634000'>And after a long time, because VC reaches VS,</span> <span
  m='1637000'>the current is going to be zero.</span> <span m='1640000'>And
  between those two points I get an exponential decay.</span> <span
  m='1644000'>I could very quickly write down the expression for the
  current.</span> <span m='1651000'>And that is simply the initial value VS
  divided by R1 times the</span> <span m='1657000'>exponential decay minus T
  divided by the time constant for</span> <span m='1663000'>the circuit R1C. You
  have seen this stuff</span> <span m='1667000'>before. Here comes the part that
  we</span> <span m='1670000'>care about for now. Let's find out what is
  the</span> <span m='1675000'>total energy provided by the source.</span> <span
  m='1680000'>When dealing with energy computations you have to be</span> <span
  m='1685000'>incredibly careful of these words here, supply,</span> <span
  m='1691000'>provided versus dissipated. Dissipated implies that the</span>
  <span m='1697000'>resistor is burning energy. Provided means that the
  source</span> <span m='1704000'>is supplying that energy. So, energy provided
  by source</span> <span m='1710000'>during T1. Let's go ahead and compute
  that</span> <span m='1715000'>very quickly. The energy supplied by the</span>
  <span m='1718000'>source is simply the voltage across the source multiplied
  by</span> <span m='1722000'>the current being supplied by the source.</span>
  <span m='1725000'>This is i. Remember, by associated</span> <span
  m='1728000'>variables convention, if I have a voltage across some</span> <span
  m='1732000'>element and the current into the element is positive then
  that</span> <span m='1737000'>element dissipates power. If the voltage here
  is,</span> <span m='1742000'>say, 1 volt and it is supplying current, if the i
  is out in the</span> <span m='1747000'>other direction then it is supplying
  power.</span> <span m='1751000'>In this case, the current i is going to be
  on</span> <span m='1755000'>the outside, heading outside. The total energy is
  going to be</span> <span m='1761000'>the instantaneous power integrated over
  time,</span> <span m='1765000'>and that is simply VS. Remember, the
  instantaneous</span> <span m='1770000'>power is VS times the current i, so the
  instantaneous power is</span> <span m='1775000'>simply VS times i, that is the
  instantaneous</span> <span m='1778000'>power. To get the energy provided
  by</span> <span m='1781000'>source and some time, I have to integrate
  that</span> <span m='1784000'>instantaneous power over the period of interest
  T1.</span> <span m='1788000'>That gives me the energy supplied by the source
  during</span> <span m='1793000'>T1. And let me go ahead and</span> <span
  m='1795000'>substitute for i with this expression here.</span> <span
  m='1800000'>It is VS times i, and i is VS divided by R1 times</span> <span
  m='1808000'>this expression here. That gives me</span> <span
  m='1814000'>(VS^2/R1)e^(-t/R1C) dt. Let me carry out the</span> <span
  m='1821000'>integration there. I get -1/RC,</span> <span m='1826000'>so I get
  this outside. And I also get to write down,</span> <span m='1835000'>oops, let
  me do that a little bit more carefully.</span> <span m='1840000'>VS^2/R1
  simply comes out and I get a -R1C in the numerator.</span> <span
  m='1846000'>If I differentiate it then I get R1C in the denominator.</span>
  <span m='1853000'>I have an integral that comes up here.</span> <span
  m='1858000'>And then I write down e^-t/R1C, zero and T1.</span> <span
  m='1863000'>So, this R1 and this R1 cancel out.</span> <span m='1867000'>And I
  end up getting something that looks like this.</span> <span m='1873000'>I get
  CVS^2. And so there is a minus sign</span> <span m='1878000'>out here, so at
  zero this thing goes to a one,</span> <span m='1883000'>so I get a one. And
  because of minus sign I get</span> <span m='1889000'>e to the -T1/R1C. All I
  have done here is simply</span> <span m='1895000'>go through the math to do
  this integration here.</span> <span m='1900000'>What I am also going to do is
  assume that if T1,</span> <span m='1905000'>if the time that the switch is
  closed is much,</span> <span m='1909000'>much bigger than the time constant of
  the circuit,</span> <span m='1914000'>T1 is much, much greater than R1C, if
  this is much,</span> <span m='1919000'>much greater than R1C then this term
  goes to zero.</span> <span m='1925000'>And this becomes more or less equal to
  CVS^2.</span> <span m='1929000'>What do we have here? What we have here is
  that if I</span> <span m='1935000'>let the switch stay closed for a long time
  and S to be open then</span> <span m='1942000'>the voltage source is going to
  supply some amount of energy.</span> <span m='1950000'>That energy will equal
  CVS^2. The voltage across the</span> <span m='1954000'>capacitor will be VS
  and all that energy would have been</span> <span m='1960000'>supplied by this
  guy. Let me pose the following</span> <span m='1964000'>conundrum here. If the
  voltage across the</span> <span m='1968000'>capacitor is VS, because we know
  the energy</span> <span m='1972000'>stored in the capacitor is half
  CV^2.</span> <span m='1976000'>So, the energy in the capacitor is half
  CVS^2.</span> <span m='1982000'>At the end of the day, since the voltage
  across the</span> <span m='1986000'>capacitor is VS, ΩCV@2 is the energy
  stored</span> <span m='1990000'>here. But we know,</span> <span
  m='1991000'>from this calculation, the source has supplied CVS^2.</span> <span
  m='1996000'>Source has supplied twice that energy.</span> <span
  m='1999000'>This guy has supplied twice that energy and only half of</span>
  <span m='2004000'>that is stored here. Who ate up the other half?</span> <span
  m='2010000'>The resistor, exactly.</span> <span m='2012000'>The resistor has
  walloped half the energy.</span> <span m='2016000'>Let me just show it to you.
  It dissipated ΩCVS^2.</span> <span m='2021000'>It's pretty interesting. It's a
  pretty simple result.</span> <span m='2027000'>If T1 is very large compared to
  time constant then half the</span> <span m='2033000'>energy is in the
  capacitor and half of it has been burned by</span> <span m='2039000'>R1. This
  energy has not been</span> <span m='2043000'>burned. It is simply
  stored.</span> <span m='2045000'>It is stored by the capacitor.</span> <span
  m='2057000'>And if you do simple energy conservation arithmetic here,</span>
  <span m='2061000'>the energy dissipated in the resistor plus that stored in
  the</span> <span m='2065000'>capacitor equals the energy supplied by the
  source.</span> <span m='2070000'>All right. Let's go to T2 now.</span> <span
  m='2073000'>At T2, S2 is closed and S1 is open.</span> <span m='2077000'>Let's
  look at the second part of the cycle when S1 is open and</span> <span
  m='2084000'>S2 is closed. And what is going to happen now</span> <span
  m='2089000'>is the left-hand part of the circuit can be ignored and I
  can</span> <span m='2096000'>focus on this part. So, S2 is closed.</span>
  <span m='2101000'>This is RC, my capacitor, this is vC.</span> <span
  m='2105000'>This is the circuit of interest.</span> <span m='2109000'>What is
  the initial condition on this?</span> <span m='2112000'>What is the value of
  vC initially?</span> <span m='2116000'>Start off, because remember, I allowed
  this capacity to</span> <span m='2122000'>charge up fully, and so initially I
  have VS on</span> <span m='2127000'>the capacitor. And so the energy on
  the</span> <span m='2132000'>capacitor initially is ΩCVS^2. That is the energy
  on the</span> <span m='2136000'>capacitor. This time around I won't go</span>
  <span m='2139000'>through an integration process like that, but you can if
  you</span> <span m='2144000'>like, and do it in a much similar manner to say
  that now</span> <span m='2149000'>let's suppose that T2 is much greater than
  this time constant.</span> <span m='2154000'>If T2 is much greater than R2C,
  this time constant.</span> <span m='2160000'>If that time is much greater than
  this entire,</span> <span m='2164000'>the initial voltage VS drives a current
  through the resistor,</span> <span m='2171000'>and after some amount of time
  the voltage across the capacitor</span> <span m='2177000'>goes to zero and all
  the energy in the capacitor gets dissipated</span> <span m='2184000'>in R. So,
  if T2 is much greater than</span> <span m='2188000'>R2C then energy dissipated
  in R2 is simply ΩCVS^2.</span> <span m='2195000'>Notice that the energy
  dissipated in R1,</span> <span m='2198000'>in the first half cycle is ΩCVS^2
  and the second half cycle</span> <span m='2203000'>during T2, if T2 is large
  enough, all this energy gets</span> <span m='2208000'>dissipated in this
  resistor R2. And I have that expression</span> <span m='2213000'>here.</span>
  <span m='2220000'>So let me just say that this is E1 and let me say that this
  is</span> <span m='2227000'>E2. So, E1 is dissipated in the</span> <span
  m='2230000'>resistor and E2 is dissipated in R2 in the second half
  cycle.</span> <span m='2237000'>A couple of interesting things to note at this
  point.</span> <span m='2243000'>One is that E1 and E2 are independent of
  R.</span> <span m='2250000'>If the time constant is small enough compared to
  the time that</span> <span m='2253000'>I charge the capacitor then half the
  energy gets lots in the</span> <span m='2257000'>resistor, and that is simply
  ΩCVS^2.</span> <span m='2260000'>And if I let this discharge completely it
  doesn't matter</span> <span m='2263000'>what resistor I am discharging it
  through.</span> <span m='2266000'>That's the intuition. If I have certain
  energy here</span> <span m='2269000'>and I let it discharge completely it
  doesn't matter</span> <span m='2272000'>what this resistor is. Small or
  large,</span> <span m='2275000'>it doesn't matter. All this energy gets
  dissipated</span> <span m='2278000'>there. The rate at which the energy</span>
  <span m='2282000'>gets dissipated will change depending on R2.</span> <span
  m='2285000'>If R2 is very small then I get a burst of power initially
  and</span> <span m='2289000'>then a rapid decay after that, but if R2 is very
  large then I</span> <span m='2294000'>have a much slower release of
  energy.</span> <span m='2296000'>But suffice it to say that the energy
  dissipated,</span> <span m='2300000'>the total energy in T2 is simply
  ΩCVS^2.</span> <span m='2303000'>All right.</span> <span m='2312000'>Let's put
  T1 and T2 together and look at the total energy</span> <span
  m='2317000'>dissipated --</span> <span m='2328000'>Total energy dissipated. E
  is simply E1 plus E2.</span> <span m='2335000'>Dissipated in each cycle.
  Assuming T1 and T2 are much</span> <span m='2342000'>larger than the
  respective time constants.</span> <span m='2346000'>And I know that this is
  ΩCVS^2, ΩCVS^2, so this is simply</span> <span m='2351000'>CVS^2. If I have an
  arrangement of</span> <span m='2354000'>switches and capacitors like that, I
  charge the capacitor,</span> <span m='2359000'>discharge the capacitor, charge
  the capacitor,</span> <span m='2363000'>discharge the capacitor. What it is
  saying is that in a</span> <span m='2368000'>charge/discharge cycle I am using
  up CVS^2 of energy.</span> <span m='2374000'>ΩCVS^2 when I charge it up and
  ΩCVS^2 when I discharge it.</span> <span m='2380000'>That is what I get. Let's
  compute the average power</span> <span m='2386000'>dissipated, P average in a
  cycle is simply E/T where T is the</span> <span m='2394000'>period of the
  square wave sequence that I have shown you</span> <span m='2400000'>out there.
  This is simply CVS^2 divided by</span> <span m='2406000'>T. If the period of
  the square</span> <span m='2409000'>wave is capital T, I can express that as
  a</span> <span m='2414000'>frequency. Let's say for example the</span> <span
  m='2418000'>period of the square wave is T, so let's say the frequency
  of</span> <span m='2425000'>the square wave is simply 1/T. I can also express
  this as</span> <span m='2433000'>C(VS^2)f.</span> <span m='2443000'>What does
  this say? Let me mark that as a thing to</span> <span m='2449000'>remember,
  the second thing to remember.</span> <span m='2453000'>One was the power that
  was the static power.</span> <span m='2460000'>And second is this power
  relating to this frequency f and</span> <span m='2464000'>the charging and
  discharging of the capacitor in that little</span> <span m='2468000'>circuit
  shown up there. So, this average power is</span> <span m='2471000'>CVS^2f.
  What this is saying is that if</span> <span m='2474000'>f is high, if I have
  high frequency of charging and</span> <span m='2477000'>discharging the
  capacitor then I am charging and discharging much</span> <span
  m='2482000'>more frequently so I am going to consume more power.</span> <span
  m='2487000'>Notice that at any given time there is no direct connection</span>
  <span m='2490000'>between the power supply and the ground.</span> <span
  m='2493000'>What I am doing is my capacitor is an intermediary.</span> <span
  m='2496000'>I am dumping some charge in the capacitor and the capacitor
  is</span> <span m='2500000'>dumping the charge into ground. It behaves like a
  switch to</span> <span m='2503000'>capacitor. And what it is doing is it
  is</span> <span m='2506000'>being charged and discharged at frequency
  f.</span> <span m='2509000'>So, it makes sense that the amount of average
  current that I</span> <span m='2512000'>am pumping through relates to the
  frequency at which I am</span> <span m='2516000'>charging and discharging the
  capacitor.</span> <span m='2520000'>And similarly the average power also
  relates to the value of the</span> <span m='2525000'>capacitor. If C is larger
  I dissipate more</span> <span m='2529000'>energy. And the same way with
  the</span> <span m='2532000'>voltage. If the voltage is higher then</span>
  <span m='2535000'>the power in that period, or the average power relates
  to</span> <span m='2540000'>CVS^2. Spend a few seconds staring at</span> <span
  m='2544000'>the two expressions. This power here relating to</span> <span
  m='2549000'>just this connection between the power supply and ground and
  that</span> <span m='2554000'>power out there relating to charging and
  discharging</span> <span m='2559000'>capacitors. Let's get back to our
  inverter</span> <span m='2562000'>right now.</span> <span m='2575000'>This is
  our inverter circuit. Let us say that I drive the</span> <span
  m='2580000'>input with the waveform shown here.</span> <span m='2583000'>Well,
  I go back to the same situation as here.</span> <span m='2588000'>I drive the
  input with a square wave, with T1 and T2 as the high</span> <span
  m='2594000'>time and the low time. The equivalent circuit for this</span>
  <span m='2599000'>is not exactly what we saw there.</span> <span
  m='2602000'>The equivalent circuit for this would look like this.</span> <span
  m='2607000'>I have a VS. And the VS supply is connected</span> <span
  m='2614000'>through RL, VS connected through RL to a capacitor C.</span> <span
  m='2620000'>This is my voltage vO. So, VS is always connected to</span> <span
  m='2627000'>ground through this resistor and capacitor in this manner.</span>
  <span m='2635000'>And then I have a resistor here RON corresponding to
  that</span> <span m='2642000'>MOSFET. And there I am switching it on</span>
  <span m='2649000'>and off in a way that it is on during T1 and off during
  T2.</span> <span m='2657000'>So, the situation here is a bit different from
  that simple</span> <span m='2665000'>situation I computed there. Much like I
  computed the power</span> <span m='2673000'>dissipation in that circuit, I can
  go ahead and compute the</span> <span m='2679000'>total power dissipated in
  this circuit.</span> <span m='2683000'>I won't do it here. The algebra tends
  to be a big</span> <span m='2688000'>more grubbier than what I have been
  through.</span> <span m='2693000'>And suffice it to say that you can show that
  the average power</span> <span m='2699000'>is given by
  (VS^2)/(2(RL+RON))+(CVS^2)f</span> <span m='2703000'>(RL^2)/(RL+RON)^2.</span>
  <span m='2712000'>OK? And for details I suggest that</span> <span
  m='2714000'>you look at section 12.3 of the course notes.</span> <span
  m='2718000'>Section 12.3 goes through the algebra to compute the total</span>
  <span m='2723000'>power dissipated by this specific circuit,</span> <span
  m='2726000'>and here is the expression we get.</span> <span m='2730000'>And
  let's take the specific situation where RL is much</span> <span
  m='2737000'>greater than RON. If RL is much greater than RON</span> <span
  m='2743000'>then I can ignore this RON here.</span> <span m='2755000'>And I
  get this. And out here,</span> <span m='2757000'>if I ignore RON, then RL and
  RL will cancel out</span> <span m='2762000'>and I get CVS^2f. If I ignore RON
  compared to RL</span> <span m='2767000'>this is the expression I get. Now you
  can see why I went</span> <span m='2772000'>through those two examples. This
  is exactly the power</span> <span m='2777000'>consumed by the connection
  between power supply and ground.</span> <span m='2782000'>And this CVS^2f is
  the power consumed in charging and</span> <span m='2786000'>discharging the
  capacitor. If you look at the circuit here</span> <span m='2792000'>it is
  consuming two kinds of power.</span> <span m='2795000'>One kind of power is
  due to the current flowing directly from VS</span> <span m='2800000'>through
  RL and RON to ground. Oh, this also assumes,</span> <span m='2804000'>by the
  way, that T1 is equal to T2.</span> <span m='2815000'>So, in this circuit
  there are two kinds of power.</span> <span m='2817000'>One is the power when
  the switch is on and I have a</span> <span m='2819000'>current flowing from VS
  to RL to ground.</span> <span m='2822000'>Notice I get an extra factor of two
  in the denominator here.</span> <span m='2825000'>And that two comes about
  because the connection to ground</span> <span m='2829000'>only happens half
  the time. It's half that power out there</span> <span m='2833000'>because I am
  connected to ground only when the switch is on.</span> <span m='2837000'>And
  that happens only half the time, and so therefore I get the</span> <span
  m='2841000'>VS^2/2RL. And then CVS^2f is simply the</span> <span
  m='2844000'>power that I consumed because I am charging and discharging
  the</span> <span m='2848000'>capacitor C. Notice that in this inverter</span>
  <span m='2851000'>circuit there are two kinds of power.</span> <span
  m='2854000'>One is called the standby power which is static power being</span>
  <span m='2858000'>consumed by the circuit, and the second power is the</span>
  <span m='2861000'>dynamic power because the circuit is switching up and</span>
  <span m='2864000'>down. This relates to star and this</span> <span
  m='2867000'>relates to the double star. And to demonstrate that,</span> <span
  m='2870000'>I have a little demonstration here that has an inverter.</span>
  <span m='2873000'>And I am going to up the frequency of the square way
  of</span> <span m='2877000'>driving the inverter. I am going to show you a
  few</span> <span m='2881000'>numbers so hang on for two minutes after this
  demo.</span> <span m='2884000'>I will give you some numbers, but I want you to
  go ahead and</span> <span m='2888000'>compute the numbers based on what we
  have seen here.</span> <span m='2891000'>And you will get suitably impressed,
  I promise you.</span> <span m='2894000'>This is the input fed to the
  inverter.</span> <span m='2896000'>This is the output of the inverter.</span>
  <span m='2899000'>Notice that the output of the inverter reflects some sort
  of</span> <span m='2902000'>an RC time constant because of the output driving
  the</span> <span m='2905000'>capacitor, and the same way here.</span> <span
  m='2909000'>I start off by showing you that on the left-hand side I am</span>
  <span m='2913000'>simply measuring the power being consumed by the
  circuit.</span> <span m='2918000'>Notice that the power being consumed is
  expressed by the</span> <span m='2923000'>needle being at this point here.
  This is a very low frequency so</span> <span m='2928000'>this is almost all
  standby power consumed by the inverter.</span> <span m='2933000'>The inverter
  is on half the time, and when it is on it is</span> <span
  m='2937000'>consuming power. What I am going to now is</span> <span
  m='2941000'>increase the frequency. As I increase the frequency</span> <span
  m='2944000'>driving the inverter what should happen to this needle?</span>
  <span m='2947000'>As I increase the frequency there that waveform
  should</span> <span m='2950000'>become closer and closer together.</span>
  <span m='2952000'>And what should happen to the needle?</span> <span
  m='2955000'>That should begin to go up. If I increase the frequency it</span>
  <span m='2958000'>should consume more and more power and the needle
  should</span> <span m='2961000'>start going up. So, let me do that for
  you.</span> <span m='2964000'>In terms of numbers there it is on top of the
  four on the scale</span> <span m='2968000'>in the middle. I am going to
  increase the</span> <span m='2971000'>frequency very slowly.
  Unfortunately,</span> <span m='2974000'>the sampling scope messes up the
  waveform.</span> <span m='2977000'>Ignore the waveform for now. Just look at
  the meter as I</span> <span m='2981000'>increase the frequency.</span> <span
  m='2989000'>Notice that I have increased the frequency by about a
  factor</span> <span m='2992000'>of 2 or 3. And notice here that this
  meter</span> <span m='2994000'>has moved. The needle has moved to the</span>
  <span m='2996000'>right. And I can keep doing that and</span> <span
  m='2998000'>the needle keeps moving to the right as I am consuming more
  and</span> <span m='3001000'>more power because I'm driving the inverter
  faster and faster</span> <span m='3004000'>and faster. That should convince
  you that</span> <span m='3007000'>there is a standby power and there is some
  power component</span> <span m='3011000'>related to frequency. This relates to
  your standby</span> <span m='3015000'>power in your cell phone. This relates
  to active use.</span> <span m='3018000'>Let me show you some numbers, and you
  can plug those numbers</span> <span m='3022000'>in yourself and see how much
  power this converter is going to</span> <span m='3026000'>consume and see if
  it makes sense.</span> <span m='3029000'>Assume that I have a chip with 10^8
  gates.</span> <span m='3033000'>F is 1 gigahertz. That is 10^9.</span> <span
  m='3038000'>Assume C is 0.1 femtofarads which is 10^-16 farads.</span> <span
  m='3047000'>Assume VS is 5 volts. Assume RL is 10 kilo ohms.</span> <span
  m='3056000'>Use these numbers. Plug these numbers in here and</span> <span
  m='3066000'>get a sense if our modern-day circuitry used that inverter,</span>
  <span m='3076000'>what would be the power consumed by a chip that
  contains</span> <span m='3086000'>10^8 of these gates? You will find out that
  you may</span> <span m='3095000'>have to use a nuclear power reactor to
  actually drive that</span> <span m='3105000'>chip, but go check it out for
  yourselves.</span> <span m='3112000'>In the next lecture we will see then how
  do our cell phones</span> <span m='3123000'>work, how does life go on despite
  this horrendous</span> <span m='3131000'>calculation here.</span> </p>
