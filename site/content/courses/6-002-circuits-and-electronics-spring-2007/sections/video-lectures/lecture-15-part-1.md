transcript: >-
  <p><span m='0'>All right. Good morning,</span> <span m='3000'>all. So we take
  another big step</span> <span m='8000'>forward today and get onto a new plane
  of understanding,</span> <span m='16000'>if you will. In the last week and a
  half,</span> <span m='23000'>our focus was on the storage element or storage
  elements</span> <span m='31000'>called inductors and capacitors. And
  capacitors stored change</span> <span m='40000'>and inductors essentially
  stored energy in the field,</span> <span m='46000'>the magnetic flux. And the
  state variable for an</span> <span m='51000'>inductor was the current while
  that for a capacitor was the</span> <span m='57000'>capacitor voltage. We also
  looked at circuits</span> <span m='62000'>containing a single storage element,
  we looked at RC</span> <span m='66000'>circuits and we also looked at circuits
  containing a single</span> <span m='71000'>inductor. And this was a single
  inductor</span> <span m='74000'>with a resistor and a current source or a
  voltage source and</span> <span m='79000'>so on. What we are going to do
  today</span> <span m='82000'>is do what are called "second-order
  systems".</span> </p><p><span m='96000'>So they are on the next plane
  now.</span> </p><p><span m='98000'>And with this second-order of systems, they
  are characterized</span> <span m='103000'>by circuits containing two
  independent storage elements.</span> </p><p><span m='107000'>They could be an
  inductor and a capacitor or two independent</span> <span
  m='112000'>capacitors. And you will see towards the</span> <span
  m='115000'>end what I mean by two independent capacitors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='120000'>If I have two capacitors in parallel, they can be</span> <span
  m='123000'>represented as a single equivalent capacitor so that</span> <span
  m='126000'>doesn't count. It has to be two independent</span> <span
  m='128000'>energy storage elements and resistors and voltage sources</span>
  <span m='132000'>and so on. And what we end up getting is</span> <span
  m='134000'>what is called "second-order dynamics".</span> </p><p><span
  m='137000'>And much as first order circuits were represented using</span>
  <span m='140000'>first order differential equations, this kind you end
  up</span> <span m='144000'>getting second-order differential equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='148000'>Before we go into this, I would like to start</span>
  <span m='151000'>motivating this and give you one example of why this is
  important</span> <span m='156000'>to study. There are many,</span> <span
  m='158000'>many examples but I will give you one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='161000'>What I would like to do is draw your attention to our good
  old</span> <span m='165000'>inverter driving a second inverter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='168000'>The same circuit that we used to motivate RC
  studies,</span> <span m='172000'>one inverter driving another. So let me draw
  the circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='186000'>Here is one inverter. This is,
  let's say,</span> <span m='190000'>5 volts and this is, let's say, 2 kilo
  ohms.</span> </p><p><span m='195000'>And I connect the output of this inverter
  to a second</span> <span m='201000'>inverter. And what we saw in the last
  few</span> <span m='206000'>lectures was that in this specific example there
  was a</span> <span m='212000'>parasitic capacitor or a capacitor associated
  with the</span> <span m='218000'>gate of this MOSFET. And that could be
  modeled by</span> <span m='224000'>sticking a capacitor CGS between the gate
  of the MOSFET and</span> <span m='229000'>ground. And we saw that the
  waveforms</span> <span m='233000'>here, if I had some kind of step
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='237000'>Let's say, for example, a step that went
  from high to</span> <span m='241000'>low. Then out here I would have a</span>
  <span m='243000'>transition that instead of going up rapidly like this
  would</span> <span m='248000'>transition a little bit more slowly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='251000'>And this transition was characterized by an RC
  time</span> <span m='255000'>constant. And this is what gave rise to a</span>
  <span m='258000'>delay in the eventual output. So that is what we saw</span>
  <span m='262000'>previously, single energy storage element.</span>
  </p><p><span m='267000'>Today what we are going to do is we are going to look
  at the</span> <span m='271000'>same circuit, the exact same circuit,</span>
  <span m='274000'>and have some fun with it. What we are going to say is</span>
  <span m='278000'>look, this thing is pretty slow, so what I would like to do
  is</span> <span m='283000'>-- why don't we go ahead and put that up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='295000'>What we are going to see is that the yellow waveform
  is the</span> <span m='301000'>waveform at the input here. And the green
  waveform here is</span> <span m='306000'>the waveform at this intermediate
  node.</span> </p><p><span m='309000'>And notice that this waveform here is
  characterized by the</span> <span m='313000'>slowly rising characteristics
  that are typical of an RC</span> <span m='317000'>circuit. There are some
  other</span> <span m='319000'>weirdnesses and so on going on here like a
  little bump and</span> <span m='324000'>stuff like that. You can ignore all of
  that for</span> <span m='327000'>now. It happens because of certain</span>
  <span m='331000'>other very subtle circuit effects that you won't be</span>
  <span m='335000'>dealing with, called Miller effects and so on</span> <span
  m='338000'>that you won't be dealing with in 6.002.</span> </p><p><span
  m='341000'>So focus then on this part here.</span> </p><p><span m='343000'>It
  is pretty slow. And because of that slow</span> <span m='346000'>rising, I get
  a very slow transition and I get some delay</span> <span m='351000'>in my
  inverter. So you say ah-ha,</span> <span m='353000'>we learned about this in
  6.002, I can make it go faster.</span> </p><p><span m='359000'>How can you
  make the circuit go faster?</span> </p><p><span m='362000'>What could you do?
  This is rising very slowly.</span> </p><p><span m='366000'>How can you make it
  go faster? Anybody?</span> </p><p><span m='369000'>You have multiple choices,
  actually.</span> </p><p><span m='372000'>What are your choices here?
  Pardon.</span> </p><p><span m='375000'>Decrease the time constant. And how
  would you decrease the</span> <span m='380000'>time constant? The capacitance
  is connected to</span> <span m='384000'>this MOSFET gate here. I didn't want
  it in the first</span> <span m='390000'>place but it is there, I cannot help
  it,</span> <span m='392000'>so I can decrease the resistance.</span>
  </p><p><span m='395000'>Good. Let me go ahead and do that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='397000'>What I will do is I am going to knock this sucker out and
  stick</span> <span m='402000'>in a new resistance that is say 50 ohms, a much
  smaller</span> <span m='406000'>resistance. That should speed things
  up,</span> <span m='409000'>right? That should make things go much</span>
  <span m='411000'>faster because this is a smaller time constant because R
  is</span> <span m='416000'>smaller, correct? OK, let's go do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='420000'>And let's see if we get what we expect.</span>
  </p><p><span m='423000'>I have a little switch here. And using that
  switch,</span> <span m='427000'>I am going to switch in this little
  resistance.</span> </p><p><span m='431000'>Whoa, what on earth is happening
  out there?</span> </p><p><span m='434000'>This is so much fun. What I did is I
  switched in a</span> <span m='438000'>small resister here to decrease the time
  constant,</span> <span m='442000'>but it looks like I got a whole bunch of
  crapola that I did not</span> <span m='447000'>bargain for. This is certainly
  very fast,</span> <span m='452000'>it goes up really fast, but I am not sure
  where it is</span> <span m='456000'>going, though. Let's stare at that a
  little</span> <span m='459000'>while longer. Let me expand the time
  scale</span> <span m='462000'>for you. Look at this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='464000'>Instead of a nice little smooth thing going up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='467000'>I get something that looks like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='470000'>It looks something like a sinusoid.</span> </p><p><span
  m='473000'>It looks sinusoidal, but then it is a sinusoid that</span> <span
  m='476000'>kind of gives up and kind of gets tired and kind of goes</span>
  <span m='481000'>away. Right?</span> </p><p><span m='483000'>It kind of dies
  out. So nothing that you have</span> <span m='487000'>learned so far has
  prepared you for this.</span> </p><p><span m='491000'>And, trust me, when I
  first did some circuit</span> <span m='495000'>designs myself a long, long
  time ago I got nailed by</span> <span m='500000'>that. I looked at my
  circuit,</span> <span m='502000'>and what ended up happening was I was
  noticing these sharp lines</span> <span m='508000'>at all my transitions. When
  I looked at my scope,</span> <span m='513000'>I expected to see nice little
  square waves but I saw these</span> <span m='517000'>little nasty spikes
  sitting out there.</span> </p><p><span m='519000'>And then when I stared at it
  more carefully,</span> <span m='522000'>those spikes were really sinusoids
  that seemed to kind of</span> <span m='525000'>get tired and kind of go away.
  So those are nasty,</span> <span m='528000'>those are real and they happen all
  the time.</span> </p><p><span m='531000'>And what we will do today is try to
  get into that and</span> <span m='534000'>understand why that is the case. We
  will understand how to</span> <span m='537000'>design that away. And that is a
  real problem,</span> <span m='542000'>by the way. And the reason that is a
  real</span> <span m='545000'>problem is the following. Look at this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='549000'>Look down here. Because this intermediate</span> <span
  m='552000'>voltage is meandering all over the countryside here,</span> <span
  m='556000'>at this particular point the intermediate voltage dips quite</span>
  <span m='561000'>low. And because it dips quite low</span> <span
  m='564000'>look at the output. The output has a bump here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='570000'>And it is quite possible for this output bump to now go into</span>
  <span m='573000'>the forbidden region. Or worse.</span> </p><p><span
  m='575000'>If this swing here was higher, this could have actually gone</span>
  <span m='579000'>onto a one, so I would have gotten a false one pulse
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='583000'>Instead of having a nice one to zero
  transition,</span> <span m='586000'>I would have gotten a one to zero, oh,
  back to one,</span> <span m='589000'>oh, back to zero and then back down to
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='592000'>So this is nasty stuff, really, really
  nasty stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='597000'>What we will do is understand why
  that is the case today and</span> <span m='603000'>see if we can explain it.
  What is going on here?</span> </p><p><span m='608000'>What is really going on
  here is take a look at this circuit</span> <span m='614000'>here. I will take
  a look at this path</span> <span m='618000'>here. So this is your VS
  voltage</span> <span m='621000'>source. Path kind of goes like this and</span>
  <span m='625000'>around. It turns out that this circuit</span> <span
  m='630000'>is a loop here. And when there is current flow,</span> <span
  m='634000'>going down to basic physics you remember that I also enclose</span>
  <span m='638000'>some amount. So there is a current flowing</span> <span
  m='642000'>in a loop. And because of that there is an</span> <span
  m='645000'>effective inductance here. And, in fact,</span> <span
  m='648000'>any current flowing through a wire above a ground plane,</span>
  <span m='652000'>for that matter, can be characterized by the</span> <span
  m='656000'>inductance. So I can model that by sticking</span> <span
  m='659000'>a little inductor here. So my real circuit is not</span> <span
  m='664000'>exactly a resistor and a capacitor, but my real circuit</span>
  <span m='667000'>is an inductor as well that comes into play because of
  this</span> <span m='671000'>wire. Every wire, when there is a</span> <span
  m='673000'>current flow, has an inductance associated</span> <span
  m='676000'>with it. And because of that the real</span> <span
  m='678000'>circuit is resistor, inductor and capacitor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='681000'>So I end up with two storage elements now,</span> <span
  m='683000'>and the dynamics of that are very different from that with a</span>
  <span m='687000'>single storage element. That is just a bit of</span> <span
  m='692000'>motivation for why our study of inductors is important.</span>
  </p><p><span m='697000'>And I can draw a quick circuit here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='700000'>If you look at the circuit, start from ground,</span>
  <span m='705000'>the voltage VS and there is a resistor here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='709000'>And then I have an inductor and then I have a
  capacitor.</span> </p><p><span m='714000'>So it is a voltage source, resistor,
  inductor and</span> <span m='719000'>capacitor. For this whole week we will
  be</span> <span m='724000'>looking at circuits like this. Today what I would
  like to do</span> <span m='728000'>is start very simple, start with the
  simplest</span> <span m='731000'>possible form of this so that you can begin
  building up your</span> <span m='735000'>insight and then go into more
  complicated cases.</span> </p><p><span m='738000'>Today what I will do is
  simply begin with a case where I don't</span> <span m='742000'>have a resistor
  here and simply study a voltage source,</span> <span m='746000'>an inductor
  and a capacitor and understand what the voltage</span> <span m='750000'>looks
  like out here. So we look at the dynamics of a</span> <span m='755000'>little
  system like this. Before we go on,</span> <span m='759000'>I want to caution
  you about something.</span> </p><p><span m='762000'>It is just happenstance
  that I have introduced for you</span> <span m='766000'>capacitors based on the
  parasitic capacitance here and</span> <span m='771000'>inductance based on
  parasitic inductance.</span> </p><p><span m='774000'>I would hate to leave you
  with the impression that inductors</span> <span m='779000'>and capacitors are
  "bad". Because when you think of a</span> <span m='784000'>parasitic, you
  know, parasites.</span> </p><p><span m='785000'>These are parasitic. You
  didn't expect them there,</span> <span m='787000'>didn't expect this here and
  we got the weird behavior.</span> </p><p><span m='790000'>So parasitics have a
  bad connotation to them.</span> </p><p><span m='792000'>I do not want to leave
  you with a bad taste in your mouth about</span> <span m='795000'>capacitors
  and inductors that these are just bad things.</span> </p><p><span
  m='797000'>We just have to deal with them and deal with second-order</span>
  <span m='800000'>differential equations and all that stuff because they're
  just</span> <span m='803000'>bad stuff and we just have to deal with
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='805000'>I don't want you to end up going through
  life hating</span> <span m='807000'>capacitors and inductors. Just because of
  my choice of</span> <span m='811000'>examples, it just happened to be
  introducing them as capacitors.</span> </p><p><span m='815000'>I want to point
  out that these are fundamental lumped elements</span> <span m='819000'>in
  their own right. They are very,</span> <span m='821000'>incredibly important
  and useful circuits where we designed</span> <span m='825000'>capacitors and
  inductors because we want to have them in there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='829000'>There are many circuits that we will look at where we really</span>
  <span m='833000'>want the inductor in there. We will design an inductor
  by</span> <span m='836000'>wrapping wire around in a coil and get bigger
  inductances and</span> <span m='840000'>so. Just remember that this can
  be</span> <span m='844000'>parasitic in some cases, but in many cases it's
  good,</span> <span m='848000'>inductors are good, so just stick with
  that</span> <span m='852000'>thought. These are mostly good so don't</span>
  <span m='855000'>go around hating them. All right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='857000'>Let's go on and analyze a basic circuit like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='861000'>And what I would like to cover in the next hour are
  the</span> <span m='866000'>foundations of something like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='870000'>I will take you through the foundations so you
  understand</span> <span m='873000'>how it works. And, as always,</span> <span
  m='875000'>what I am going to end up with is build up the foundations,</span>
  <span m='879000'>help you understand why we got where we were and then help
  you</span> <span m='882000'>build intuition. And then show you a
  really,</span> <span m='885000'>really simple intuitive way of doing things in
  terms of how</span> <span m='889000'>experts do it. And the real cool thing
  about</span> <span m='892000'>EECS is that the way experts do things, things
  are really,</span> <span m='895000'>really very simple in the end. But you
  need to build up some</span> <span m='899000'>intuition to get there. So our
  circuit looks like this</span> <span m='904000'>in terms of my two storage
  elements.</span> </p><p><span m='907000'>I have a voltage vI, inductor L,
  capacitor C and I</span> <span m='911000'>am going to look at the voltage
  across the capacitor and my</span> <span m='916000'>current through the
  capacitor. So v(t) is the voltage across</span> <span m='921000'>the capacitor
  and my current is the current through this loop</span> <span m='926000'>here,
  which is the same as the current through the capacitor or</span> <span
  m='931000'>the current through the inductor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='935000'>And we are going to proceed in exactly the same manner as we</span>
  <span m='938000'>did for first order differential equations, write the
  equations</span> <span m='941000'>down and just boom, boom, boom, boom,</span>
  <span m='943000'>go down the same sets of steps but just get to some
  place</span> <span m='947000'>different. We are going to start by</span> <span
  m='948000'>writing a node equation for this node here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='951000'>That's the only node for which I have an unknown voltage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='954000'>The node here is vI, so I need to find this,</span>
  <span m='956000'>there's just one unknown node voltage.</span> </p><p><span
  m='960000'>And I am going to need some element laws.</span> </p><p><span
  m='964000'>For the capacitor I know the iV relation is given by the i
  for</span> <span m='971000'>the capacitor is Cdv/dt. And just to show the
  capacitor</span> <span m='977000'>I am just calling it dvc/dt. Similarly, for
  an inductor,</span> <span m='983000'>L, the voltage across the inductor is
  given by Ldi/dt.</span> </p><p><span m='990000'>So this is the vI relation for
  the capacitor,</span> <span m='994000'>the vI relation for an inductor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='997000'>It also suits us to write this in an integral
  form.</span> </p><p><span m='1002000'>So if I integrate both sides of this
  equation and I bring L down</span> <span m='1008000'>to this side, I end up
  getting something like</span> <span m='1013000'>this, 1/L minus infinity to t,
  VLdt, and that is simply iL.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>I am just simply
  replacing this with an integral form.</span> </p><p><span m='1024000'>So this
  is a VI relationship for the inductor and this is for</span> <span
  m='1029000'>the capacitor. So let me now go ahead and</span> <span
  m='1033000'>apply the node method for my circuit here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1036000'>Here, for the node method, I have to equate the currents</span>
  <span m='1041000'>coming into the node or sum the currents coming into the
  node</span> <span m='1046000'>and equate that to zero. And while I do that I
  simply</span> <span m='1052000'>replace the currents by the corresponding
  voltages using the</span> <span m='1057000'>element laws. So what do I
  get?</span> </p><p><span m='1060000'>I get the current going in here to the
  inductor is equal to the</span> <span m='1065000'>current going through the
  capacitor.</span> </p><p><span m='1068000'>What is the current going the
  capacitor?</span> </p><p><span m='1071000'>In terms of its v relationship it
  is Cdv/dt.</span> </p><p><span m='1075000'>And the current going to the
  inductor is given by this</span> <span m='1079000'>relation here, which is
  simply 1/L minus</span> <span m='1083000'>infinity to t. The voltage across
  the</span> <span m='1088000'>capacitor is simply (vI-v)dt. I have just written
  down the</span> <span m='1094000'>node quotation for this node here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1097000'>Now I will just apply a bit of math and simplify it
  and get the</span> <span m='1103000'>resulting equation. What I can do is
  simply</span> <span m='1108000'>differentiate with respect to t here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1113000'>And get this to be Cd^2v/dt^2, the second derivative
  of v.</span> </p><p><span m='1121000'>And here what I end up getting is
  1/L(vI-v).</span> </p><p><span m='1127000'>So I just differentiated the whole
  thing by d/dt here.</span> </p><p><span m='1134000'>And then I just move L up
  here. I bring d^2v/dt^2 out here.</span> </p><p><span m='1142000'>And then I
  get a minus v here, and that will be equal to,</span> <span m='1148000'>oh,
  I'm sorry. Let me leave this here.</span> </p><p><span m='1152000'>Bring the
  minus v to this side so it becomes a plus and leave</span> <span
  m='1158000'>vI on this side. So I end up getting</span> <span
  m='1162000'>LCd^2v/dt^2. I bring L up here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1165000'>And then I take v to the other side.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1170000'>Plus v and leave vI here so I get vI.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1173000'>That is second order differential equation that</span> <span
  m='1177000'>governs the characteristics of the voltage, v.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1180000'>So much as the voltage across the capacitor was a state</span>
  <span m='1185000'>variable in our RC circuits or the current through the
  inductor</span> <span m='1191000'>was a state variable in our RL circuits, out
  here both the</span> <span m='1195000'>current through the inductor and the
  voltage across the capacitor</span> <span m='1201000'>are my two state
  variables. And so here I have a</span> <span m='1206000'>second-order equation
  in my voltage, v.</span> </p><p><span m='1209000'>Again, going through the
  foundations here,</span> <span m='1212000'>I am now going to go through a
  bunch of math.</span> </p><p><span m='1215000'>Up to here it was circuit
  analysis, and now I am just</span> <span m='1218000'>going to do math. For the
  next three or four</span> <span m='1222000'>blackboards just math. You can
  solve this second-order</span> <span m='1225000'>differential equation any
  which way you want.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>But just to keep things as
  simple as possible,</span> <span m='1233000'>in 6.002 I solve all the
  differential equations,</span> <span m='1236000'>it turns out we are fortunate
  enough we can do that,</span> <span m='1240000'>using the exact same method
  again and again and again,</span> <span m='1243000'>the same thing can be
  applied. And the method that we use to</span> <span m='1248000'>solve it is
  the method of homogenous and particular</span> <span m='1251000'>solutions. So
  the first step we are going</span> <span m='1254000'>to find the particular
  solution, vP.</span> </p><p><span m='1258000'>Second step we find the
  homogenous solution,</span> <span m='1263000'>vH. And the third step we are
  going</span> <span m='1267000'>to find the total solution as the sum of, v is
  simply the</span> <span m='1274000'>particular plus the homogenous solution
  and then solve for</span> <span m='1281000'>constants based on the initial
  conditions and the applied</span> <span m='1287000'>voltage. So let's write
  down initial</span> <span m='1292000'>conditions. Let's assume,</span> <span
  m='1294000'>for simplicity, that my initial conditions are</span> <span
  m='1297000'>simply the voltage across the capacitor is zero to begin
  and</span> <span m='1302000'>the current through my inductor is also zero as I
  begin life.</span> </p><p><span m='1307000'>Now, this is what is called "zero
  state".</span> </p><p><span m='1311000'>v and i are both zero, and so the
  response of my</span> <span m='1314000'>circuit for some input is going to be
  called ZSR.</span> </p><p><span m='1318000'>You've probably heard this term in
  one of your recitations.</span> </p><p><span m='1325000'>So zero state
  response simply says I start with my circuit at</span> <span m='1330000'>rest
  and looks at how it behaves for some given input.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1334000'>That is a little term you may end up using.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1338000'>My input next. I am going to use the following</span> <span
  m='1342000'>input. vI of t is going to be a step,</span> <span m='1345000'>is
  going to look like this. My input is at t=0 v is going</span> <span
  m='1351000'>from zero to some voltage VI and then stay at that voltage.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1355000'>It is going to be a step. Kaboom.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1357000'>And you can see why I am going with this set of variables,</span>
  <span m='1361000'>because I want make this situation as close as
  possible</span> <span m='1365000'>to the funny behavior we observed
  there.</span> </p><p><span m='1368000'>Remember we had a step, and because of
  the step we had</span> <span m='1372000'>some behavior at that node? So I will
  try to bring you as</span> <span m='1376000'>close to that. In tomorrow's
  lecture,</span> <span m='1380000'>I am going to close the loop around that and
  derive for you</span> <span m='1384000'>exactly the behavior we saw on the
  scope.</span> </p><p><span m='1387000'>And to get there I am going to be try
  to be as close as</span> <span m='1391000'>possible to the constants and other
  parameters in the demo.</span> </p><p><span m='1395000'>So VI is a step and
  zero state. Just in terms of notation,</span> <span m='1399000'>this kind of a
  step input occurs pretty frequently.</span> </p><p><span m='1402000'>And we
  just have a special notation for it.</span> </p><p><span m='1405000'>We simply
  call it VI is the final value here.</span> </p><p><span m='1410000'>And we
  call it u(t). So VIu(t), u(t) simply</span> <span m='1413000'>represents a
  step at time t=0, steps from zero volts to VI.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1419000'>That is just a little more notation that will come in handy</span>
  <span m='1424000'>at some point. More math now.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1427000'>Three steps, particular solution,</span> <span
  m='1430000'>homogenous solution, total solution/constants.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1434000'>This is almost like a mantra here, like a chorus.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1440000'>Homogenous solution we compute using a four-step
  method.</span> </p><p><span m='1443000'>And four-step method for homogenous
  solutions,</span> <span m='1446000'>it turns out that it happens to be that
  way for all the</span> <span m='1449000'>equations we will see in our
  course.</span> </p><p><span m='1452000'>The first step would be assume a
  solution of the form Ae^st.</span> </p><p><span m='1456000'>Exactly as with
  RCs. If you close your eyes and do</span> <span m='1459000'>exactly what you
  did for RCs you will get to where you want to</span> <span m='1463000'>be. You
  assume a solution of the</span> <span m='1465000'>form Ae^st. Substitute that
  into your</span> <span m='1467000'>homogenous equation. Obtain the
  characteristic</span> <span m='1471000'>equation. Solve for the roots.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1474000'>And then write down your homogenous solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1477000'>Same sort of steps again and again and again until
  you get</span> <span m='1482000'>bored to tears. Particular solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1485000'>For the particular solution, I simply need to find
  a</span> <span m='1489000'>solution, any solution, if not the most general one
  but</span> <span m='1493000'>any solution that satisfies the particular
  equation which</span> <span m='1497000'>satisfies that equation.
  LCd^2vP/dt^2+vP=VI.</span> </p><p><span m='1503000'>My input is a step and I
  am going to look for the solution</span> <span m='1509000'>for time t greater
  than zero. Notice that for time t less</span> <span m='1515000'>than or equal
  to zero, v is going to be zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1520000'>So I am
  looking for a solution greater than t=0.</span> </p><p><span m='1526000'>Here,
  if I substitute vP=VI, that is a particular solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1534000'>Because if I substitute VI here this goes to zero and then I
  get</span> <span m='1539000'>VI=VI, so this works. I promised you this was
  going</span> <span m='1543000'>to be simple. You cannot get any simpler
  than</span> <span m='1547000'>that. I have done my first step.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1549000'>I found the particular solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1552000'>And VI is a good enough particular solution so I will</span> <span
  m='1557000'>use it, I will take it. As my second step I am going to</span>
  <span m='1563000'>find vH or the solution to the homogenous equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1568000'>And the homogenous equation is simply that equation
  with drive</span> <span m='1575000'>set to zero. What I get here is</span>
  <span m='1578000'>LCd^2vH/dt^2+vH=0. That is my homogenous equation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1583000'>I simply set the drive to be zero.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1588000'>And to find the solution here, I go through my
  four-step</span> <span m='1592000'>method. Again, in 6.002 following
  the</span> <span m='1594000'>kind of Occam's principle, we just show you the
  absolute</span> <span m='1598000'>minimum necessary to get to where you
  want.</span> </p><p><span m='1601000'>The absolute minimum necessary is it
  turns out that we can</span> <span m='1605000'>solve all our differential
  equations that we use here by</span> <span m='1610000'>using the methods of
  homogenous and particular solutions.</span> </p><p><span m='1614000'>And every
  homogenous solution can be solved by a four-step</span> <span
  m='1618000'>method. That is about as minimal as it</span> <span
  m='1624000'>can get. So no extraneous stuff there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1629000'>The four-step method, four steps.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1633000'>The first step is assume a solution of the form vH=Ae^st.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1641000'>What I have noticed is that students starting out
  are</span> <span m='1648000'>usually scared of differential equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1655000'>I know I was when I was a student.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1656000'>And the trick with differential equations is that it
  is all a</span> <span m='1660000'>matter of psych. Just because you see
  some</span> <span m='1662000'>squigglies and squagglies and a bunch of math
  and so on you say</span> <span m='1666000'>oh, that must be hard. But
  differential equations are</span> <span m='1669000'>actually the simplest
  thing there is because in a large</span> <span m='1672000'>majority of cases
  the way you solve them is you assume you</span> <span m='1675000'>know the
  answer, someone tells you the answer.</span> </p><p><span m='1679000'>And then
  all you are left to do is shove the answer into the</span> <span
  m='1682000'>equation and find out the constants that makes it the</span> <span
  m='1685000'>answer. Just a matter of psych.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1687000'>Psych yourselves that this stuff is easy,</span> <span
  m='1689000'>because I am telling you what the solution is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1691000'>All you have to do is substitute and verify.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1694000'>If you think about differential equations that way or a
  large</span> <span m='1697000'>majority of them, it really is very simple if
  you</span> <span m='1700000'>can just get past the squigglies here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1702000'>Just get past the squigglies and then just simply
  stick in</span> <span m='1706000'>some simple stuff and it works. I mean it
  just cannot get any</span> <span m='1711000'>easier. I cannot think of any
  other</span> <span m='1714000'>field where the way you find a solution is
  assume you know the</span> <span m='1719000'>solution and stick it in. It has
  never made any sense to</span> <span m='1723000'>me but that is how it is. So
  we assume the solution to</span> <span m='1728000'>the form Ae^st, you stick
  it in there,</span> <span m='1731000'>and you have to find out the A and s
  that make it so.</span> </p><p><span m='1735000'>It cannot get any simpler
  than that.</span> </p><p><span m='1738000'>Let's stick the sucker in here and
  see what we can get.</span> </p><p><span m='1742000'>Substitute Ae^st here I
  get LCA, and second derivative,</span> <span m='1747000'>so it's s^2 e^st. And
  Ae^st on this one here.</span> </p><p><span m='1752000'>And that equals zero.
  And then let me just solve for</span> <span m='1757000'>whatever I can find.
  Assuming I don't take the</span> <span m='1762000'>trivial case A=0, I cancel
  these guys out.</span> </p><p><span m='1766000'>And what I am left with is
  simply LCs^2+1=0.</span> </p><p><span m='1772000'>In other words, what I end
  up getting is B,</span> <span m='1776000'>s^2=-1/LC. My first step was,</span>
  <span m='1778000'>I am giving you solutions, stick them in there,</span> <span
  m='1783000'>assume a solution of this form. Second step is get the</span>
  <span m='1788000'>characteristic equation. And the way you get the</span>
  <span m='1793000'>characteristic equation is that you simply stick this guy
  in</span> <span m='1799000'>there. And what you end up getting is</span> <span
  m='1804000'>some equation in s^2. Do you remember what you got</span> <span
  m='1809000'>for first order circuits? What s was?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1813000'>What is s? For first order circuits,</span> <span m='1817000'>what
  did you get as a characteristic equation?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1821000'>s+1/RC=0. The same thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1824000'>Just
  remember to blindly apply the steps.</span> </p><p><span m='1830000'>It will
  lead you to the answer. This is called the</span> <span
  m='1833000'>"characteristic equation". This is incredibly important.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1837000'>You will see in about a couple weeks from now that
  once you</span> <span m='1841000'>write the characteristic equation down for a
  circuit,</span> <span m='1844000'>it tells you all there is to know about the
  circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='1848000'>And often times you can stop solving
  right here.</span> </p><p><span m='1851000'>To experienced circuit designers
  this tells me</span> <span m='1854000'>everything there is to know. This is
  really key.</span> </p><p><span m='1859000'>That's why it's called a
  characteristic equation.</span> </p><p><span m='1862000'>I believe in problem
  number three of the homework that will</span> <span m='1865000'>be coming out
  this week, that is exactly what you are</span> <span m='1869000'>going to do.
  I am going to give you a</span> <span m='1871000'>circuit, ask you to get to
  the characteristic equation quickly</span> <span m='1875000'>and then from
  there intuit the solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1878000'>Write the
  characteristic equation and then just intuit</span> <span
  m='1881000'>solution, it's that simple. So, step A, assume a solution</span>
  <span m='1885000'>of the form, step B, write the characteristic</span> <span
  m='1887000'>equation down. And let me just simplify that a</span> <span
  m='1893000'>little bit. I go ahead and find my roots.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1897000'>And my roots here, remember that j is the square</span> <span
  m='1902000'>root of minus one. And so what I end up getting</span> <span
  m='1907000'>is, my two roots here are, plus j square root of 1/LC and</span>
  <span m='1913000'>minus j square root of 1/LC. Two roots.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1919000'>And just as a shorthand notation, much like I had a</span> <span
  m='1923000'>shorthand notation for RC, what was my shorthand notation</span>
  <span m='1928000'>for RC? Tau.</span> </p><p><span m='1929000'>Just as tau was
  big in first order, we have a corresponding</span> <span m='1935000'>thing
  that is big in second order and that is omega nought.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1940000'>Omega nought is simply square root 1/LC.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1944000'>Just as tau was RC, omega nought is a shorthand</span> <span
  m='1948000'>here. And so s is simply plus or</span> <span m='1953000'>minus j
  omega nought. Notice that in this equation</span> <span m='1960000'>here, if
  you take the square root of LC there that has units</span> <span
  m='1968000'>of time, so one divided by that has units of frequency.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1976000'>Notice that this guy is a frequency in
  radians.</span> </p><p><span m='1984000'>I end up getting my roots of the
  homogenous equation,</span> <span m='1989000'>and that is my third step. And
  as my fourth step,</span> <span m='1993000'>I simply write down the homogenous
  solution as</span> <span m='1998000'>substituting s with its roots and writing
  the most general</span> <span m='2003000'>possible form of the solution, and
  that would be A1e^(j omega</span> <span m='2009000'>nought t)+A2e^(-j omega
  nought t).</span> </p><p><span m='2014000'>Done. Some constant times
  this</span> <span m='2016000'>solution plus some other constant times,</span>
  <span m='2018000'>the other solution. Plus zero omega nought.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2021000'>Remember it comes from here, Ae^st.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2024000'>I assume the solution of this form, so my solution in
  this</span> <span m='2028000'>most general case would be s being j omega
  nought in one</span> <span m='2032000'>case, minus j omega nought in the other
  case,</span> <span m='2035000'>and I sum the two to get the most general
  solution.</span> </p><p><span m='2045000'>So blasting ahead. I now have my
  homogenous</span> <span m='2050000'>solution. And as my third step of</span>
  <span m='2054000'>solution to differential equations I write down the
  total</span> <span m='2061000'>solution, v=vP+vH, particular plus the
  homogenous</span> <span m='2067000'>solutions. And v=VI, was my
  particular</span> <span m='2072000'>solution, +A1e^(j omega nought t)+A2e^(-j
  omega nought t) is my</span> <span m='2078000'>complete solution. The final
  step,</span> <span m='2081000'>write down the total solution and find the
  constants from the</span> <span m='2086000'>initial conditions. To find the
  constants from the</span> <span m='2091000'>initial conditions, let's start
  with,</span> <span m='2094000'>the voltage is zero to begin with.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2099000'>This equation governs the characteristics of
  v,</span> <span m='2103000'>so I need to find the initial conditions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2108000'>First of all, I know that know that v(0)=0.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2112000'>From there I substitute t=0. And so this goes to
  one,</span> <span m='2117000'>this goes to one, and I end up getting</span>
  <span m='2121000'>0=VI+A1+A2. That is my first expression.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2125000'>And then I am also given that i(0)=0.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2131000'>And so I can get that as well. How do I get i?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2137000'>This is v. I know that i=Cdv/dt,</span> <span m='2141000'>so I can
  get i by simply multiplying by C and</span> <span m='2147000'>differentiating
  this with respect to t.</span> </p><p><span m='2152000'>I get C, this guy
  vanishes so I get d/dt of this.</span> </p><p><span m='2160000'>So it is CA1(j
  omega nought) e^(j omega nought t)+CA2(-j</span> <span m='2167000'>omega
  nought)e^(-j omega nought t).</span> </p><p><span m='2172000'>From here I am
  given that that is zero, and so therefore this</span> <span m='2181000'>guy
  becomes a one, this guy becomes a one,</span> <span m='2186000'>j omega
  nought, j omega nought cancel out.</span> </p><p><span m='2194000'>What I end
  up getting is A1=A2. From the second initial</span> <span
  m='2203000'>condition I get A1=A2. From these two,</span> <span m='2210000'>if
  I substitute here for A2, I get VI + 2A1 = 0,</span> <span m='2218000'>or
  A1=-VI/2. That is also equal to A2.</span> </p><p><span m='2225000'>Therefore,
  my total solution now can be written in terms of</span> <span m='2233000'>the
  actual values of the constants I have obtained.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2239000'>I get VI-VI/2. So A1 and A2 are equal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2244000'>I just pull them outside. I pull VI-2 outside and I stick</span>
  <span m='2253000'>these two guys in parenthesis in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2258000'>Again, I promised you no more circuits from here on until
  the</span> <span m='2266000'>very last board or something like that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2272000'>It is all math, so not much else happening</span>
  <span m='2277000'>there. More math.</span> </p><p><span m='2281000'>If you
  would like, I could skip all the way to the</span> <span m='2286000'>end and
  show you the answer. But I just love to write</span> <span
  m='2293000'>equations on the board so let me just go through that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2299000'>I am going to simplify this a little further
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2305000'>And we should remember this form by the
  Euler relation,</span> <span m='2311000'>ejx=cos x+j sin x. And by the same
  token,</span> <span m='2318000'>(e^jx + e^-jx)/2=cos x. You all should know
  this from</span> <span m='2327000'>the Euler relation. So were are using this
  guy</span> <span m='2334000'>here, ej^x + e^-jx=2cos x. And so this one is 2
  cosine of</span> <span m='2344000'>omega nought t, 2 and 2 cancel out,</span>
  <span m='2348000'>and what I am left with is v(t)=VI-VI cos( omega nought
  t).</span> </p><p><span m='2356000'>And the current is Cdv/dt, which is simply
  CVI sin( omega</span> <span m='2364000'>nought t). Just remember that omega
  nought</span> <span m='2370000'>is the square root of 1/LC. We are
  done.</span> </p><p><span m='2376000'>In fact, I did not give that answer the
  importance that was</span> <span m='2384000'>due so let me just draw.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2397000'>There. That is better.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2400000'>Enough math. In a nutshell,</span> <span m='2402000'>what did we
  do. We wrote the node method,</span> <span m='2406000'>it's a very simple
  circuit, to write down the equation</span> <span m='2410000'>governing that
  circuit. And then we grunged through a</span> <span m='2415000'>bunch of math.
  Not a whole lot here.</span> </p><p><span m='2418000'>It is pretty simple. And
  ended up with a relation</span> <span m='2423000'>that says the voltage across
  the capacitor for a step input,</span> <span m='2428000'>assuming zero state,
  is a constant VI-VI cos omega</span> <span m='2433000'>t. Notice that even
  though I have</span> <span m='2436000'>a step input, the circuit dynamics are
  such</span> <span m='2439000'>that I get a cosine in there. You can begin to
  see where</span> <span m='2442000'>these cosines are coming from now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2444000'>They come in here. And if you recall the example
  I</span> <span m='2447000'>showed you earlier of the inverter circuit,</span>
  <span m='2450000'>remember there was a cosine that decayed,</span> <span
  m='2452000'>that was sort of losing energy and kind of dying out?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2456000'>So you can see where the cosines are coming
  from.</span> </p><p><span m='2460000'>And just to draw you a little sketch
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2471000'>Let me draw v and i for you and let me
  plot omega t,</span> <span m='2486000'>pi/2, pi and so on. Let me plot
  VI.</span> </p><p><span m='2495000'>When time t=0, VI=0, cosine omega t is
  one,</span> <span m='2501000'>and so VI-VI=0. That is simply a cosine
  that</span> <span m='2508000'>starts out at zero here, and at pi I get cosine
  omega t</span> <span m='2516000'>is minus one, so I get plus VI on the
  other</span> <span m='2522000'>side. So I end up at +2VI.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2528000'>At this point the voltage is here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2533000'>And notice that this guy looks like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2539000'>It is a cosine that is translated up so that its mean</span> <span
  m='2547000'>value is not zero but VI. It is just a translation up of</span>
  <span m='2557000'>a cosine. Similarly, in this case for the</span> <span
  m='2562000'>current it is a sinusoidal characteristic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2568000'>And it looks something like this where the peak is given by</span>
  <span m='2576000'>CVI, oh, I messed up.</span> </p><p><span m='2588000'>When I
  differentiated this is missed the omega nought out</span> <span
  m='2594000'>there.</span> </p><p><span m='2605000'>What I would like to do now
  -- This is the form of the output</span> <span m='2610000'>for a step input.
  What I would like to do next is</span> <span m='2613000'>show you a demo. But
  before I show you a demo,</span> <span m='2616000'>I always found it strange
  that I have a step input and then I</span> <span m='2620000'>have two little
  elements, how can I get a sine coming out</span> <span m='2624000'>of the
  output? I would like to get some</span> <span m='2627000'>intuition as to why
  things behave the way they are.</span> </p><p><span m='2630000'>I could go and
  pray to find out, but let me just give you</span> <span m='2634000'>some very
  basic insight as to why this behaves the way it</span> <span m='2638000'>does.
  Let me draw the circuit for you</span> <span m='2642000'>here. And this is my
  inductor L and</span> <span m='2645000'>capacitance C. Remember this is
  v.</span> </p><p><span m='2648000'>Let me just walk you through what is
  happening there and get</span> <span m='2653000'>you to understand this. Now,
  you have seen sines occur</span> <span m='2657000'>before. If you go and write
  down the</span> <span m='2660000'>equation of motion of a pendulum, you
  know,</span> <span m='2664000'>you have a pendulum, you move it to one
  side,</span> <span m='2668000'>let go. It is also governed by</span> <span
  m='2671000'>sinusoidal characteristics. And you will find that the</span>
  <span m='2675000'>equation governing its motion is very much of the same
  form,</span> <span m='2679000'>and you get the sinusoid where you have energy
  that is sloshing</span> <span m='2683000'>back and forth between maximum
  potential energy to maximum</span> <span m='2687000'>kinetic energy and zero
  potential energy back to maximum</span> <span m='2691000'>potential energy,
  zero kinetic.</span> </p><p><span m='2693000'>So it is energy sloshing back
  and forth.</span> </p><p><span m='2696000'>The same way here. Capacitors and
  inductors store</span> <span m='2701000'>energy. Let's walk through and see
  what</span> <span m='2704000'>happens. I start off with both of them</span>
  <span m='2706000'>having the stage zero, zero current,</span> <span
  m='2709000'>zero voltage. I apply a step here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2711000'>Boom, the step comes instanteously to VI.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2714000'>I notice that the capacitor voltage cannot change instantly</span>
  <span m='2718000'>unless there is an infinite pulse of a sort,</span> <span
  m='2722000'>so this guy cannot change instantly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2724000'>And so its voltage starts off being zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2729000'>So the entire voltage here, KVL must be true no matter</span>
  <span m='2732000'>what. They are absolutely fundamental</span> <span
  m='2734000'>principles from Maxwell's equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2736000'>KVL must hold, which means that the entire</span> <span
  m='2738000'>voltage VI must appear across the inductor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2740000'>I put a big voltage across the inductor and its current
  begins</span> <span m='2744000'>to build up. There you go.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2745000'>A voltage across the inductor, its current begins to build
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='2749000'>As its current begins to build up that
  current must flow</span> <span m='2752000'>through the capacitor, too.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2754000'>And as current flows through a capacitor it is
  depositing</span> <span m='2757000'>charge into the capacitor. As the
  capacitor begins to get</span> <span m='2762000'>charge deposited on it, its
  voltage begins to rise.</span> </p><p><span m='2767000'>Let's see what happens
  here. Its voltage keeps rising.</span> </p><p><span m='2772000'>At some point,
  the voltage across the</span> <span m='2776000'>capacitor is equal to VI. But
  then VI equals this VI</span> <span m='2781000'>here. So when the two become
  VI,</span> <span m='2784000'>the inductor has zero volts across it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2789000'>So there is no longer a potential difference that
  is</span> <span m='2792000'>increasing the current in that direction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2795000'>At that point, at pi divided by 2,</span> <span
  m='2797000'>I have some current going into the inductor so there is no</span>
  <span m='2802000'>longer a pressure that is forcing more current through
  the</span> <span m='2806000'>inductor because this voltage reaches VI.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2809000'>But remember capacitors like to sit around holding
  voltages.</span> </p><p><span m='2813000'>Just remember that demo. That
  rinky-dink capacitor sat</span> <span m='2817000'>there stubbornly holding its
  voltage.</span> </p><p><span m='2821000'>And it had a huge spark towards the
  end.</span> </p><p><span m='2823000'>It just sat there holding its
  voltage.</span> </p><p><span m='2825000'>In the same manner, inductors love to
  sit around</span> <span m='2829000'>holding a current. They will do whatever
  they can</span> <span m='2832000'>to keep the current going through
  them.</span> </p><p><span m='2834000'>It has got the current going
  through.</span> </p><p><span m='2837000'>And few forces on earth can change
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='2839000'>And so therefore, even though the
  capacitor</span> <span m='2842000'>voltage is VI and the voltage drop across
  the inductor is</span> <span m='2846000'>zero, it still keeps supplying a
  current.</span> </p><p><span m='2850000'>It has got the current. It's got
  inertia.</span> </p><p><span m='2852000'>It keeps going. It is like a runaway
  train.</span> </p><p><span m='2854000'>You may not be pushing the train from
  the back,</span> <span m='2857000'>but once it is running it has got kinetic
  energy and is going</span> <span m='2861000'>to run no matter what for a least
  some more time,</span> <span m='2863000'>even if you take away the force on
  the train.</span> </p><p><span m='2866000'>So I have taken away the force on
  the punching more current</span> <span m='2869000'>through, but it has kinetic
  energy.</span> </p><p><span m='2872000'>It has current flowing through it so
  it continues to supply a</span> <span m='2875000'>current. Because it
  continues to supply</span> <span m='2877000'>the current the capacitor voltage
  keeps increasing.</span> </p><p><span m='2882000'>This is a subtle insight
  which is absolutely spectacular that</span> <span m='2885000'>with zero volts
  across it, it still keeps pumping that</span> <span m='2889000'>current.
  Capacitor voltage has gone up.</span> </p><p><span m='2891000'>And guess what?
  The voltage on this side is</span> <span m='2894000'>higher now but this guy
  is still pumping a current.</span> </p><p><span m='2897000'>Man, I have been
  born to do this, you know,</span> <span m='2900000'>I shall pump a current.
  However, because the voltage</span> <span m='2904000'>has now gone up here
  gradually the current begins to diminish.</span> </p><p><span m='2909000'>So
  the capacitor is concerned. You pump a current into me,</span> <span
  m='2913000'>my voltage goes up. At some point,</span> <span m='2916000'>like a
  runaway train, it comes to a halt.</span> </p><p><span m='2919000'>The current
  through the capacitor drains and now goes to</span> <span m='2924000'>zero and
  the capacitor voltage reaches 2VI.</span> </p><p><span m='2927000'>So this is
  at 2VI now and this is at VI.</span> </p><p><span m='2930000'>Now the
  situation is not in equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='2933000'>At this point
  there is zero current through it,</span> <span m='2937000'>but guess what? I
  have a VI pumping in this</span> <span m='2941000'>direction now. I have the
  same VI punching in</span> <span m='2945000'>this direction. So guess
  what?</span> </p><p><span m='2947000'>Its current must now build up in this
  direction and its</span> <span m='2951000'>current begins to build up in that
  direction.</span> </p><p><span m='2954000'>That begins to discharge the
  capacitor and the capacitor then</span> <span m='2958000'>goes on to a
  negative, or the current goes down to a</span> <span m='2962000'>maximum
  negative current, and this process continues.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2966000'>What you are seeing here is energy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2970000'>It is sloshing back and forth between the two,</span> <span
  m='2973000'>and that is kind of a key. I will just quickly put up a</span>
  <span m='2977000'>demo that you can watch as you are walking out.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2980000'>With a step input, notice the green is the
  voltage</span> <span m='2984000'>across the capacitor and the orange is the
  current through</span> <span m='2988000'>the capacitor.</span> </p>
