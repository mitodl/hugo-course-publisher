title: 'Lecture 25: Violating the Abstraction Barrier'
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='0'>All right. Good morning.</span> </p><p><span m='2000'>Good
  morning. So, we have some fun stuff for</span> <span m='8000'>today's lecture,
  and as far as the final is</span> <span m='13000'>concerned and so on, I'd
  like you to forget about</span> <span m='19000'>anything we do today,
  absolutely.</span> </p><p><span m='23000'>So, get your mind to become a blank,
  and forget anything you</span> <span m='31000'>hear in today's lecture. So,
  what I'm going to show you</span> <span m='38000'>today will hopefully
  completely blow your minds.</span> </p><p><span m='42000'>And I'm not talking
  about controlled substances or</span> <span m='46000'>anything. So what I'm
  going to do is show</span> <span m='49000'>you a few things that behave
  completely and spectacularly</span> <span m='54000'>differently than how you
  expect them to.</span> </p><p><span m='58000'>And, today's lecture is
  appropriately called --</span> <span m='77000'>OK. So, we're going to violate
  the</span> <span m='79000'>abstraction barrier here, and do some fun
  things.</span> </p><p><span m='82000'>And, the important thing to realize is
  that in all of 6.002,</span> <span m='86000'>we have, after all, based on some
  assumptions we</span> <span m='89000'>made at the beginning of the course like
  lumped matter</span> <span m='93000'>discipline and so on, we have landed
  ourselves in</span> <span m='96000'>this playground called the playground of
  6.002.</span> </p><p><span m='101000'>And, within that playground, certain
  ground rules apply.</span> </p><p><span m='104000'>OK, and our entire course
  depended on those assumptions</span> <span m='107000'>being true. So, for
  example,</span> <span m='109000'>the first assumption we made that brought us
  from Maxwell's</span> <span m='113000'>equations to the lumped matter
  discipline was,</span> <span m='116000'>or rather the circuit abstraction, was
  a lumped matter</span> <span m='119000'>discipline. And there were three
  tenets of</span> <span m='123000'>the lumped matter discipline. One is that
  the rate of change</span> <span m='126000'>of flux was going to be zero within
  our circuits,</span> <span m='130000'>not inside elements, but in the circuit
  itself,</span> <span m='133000'>and second, the dq by dt was going to be zero
  outside the</span> <span m='137000'>elements, and third, something we did not
  dwell upon</span> <span m='140000'>in the course, but it's certainly present
  in</span> <span m='143000'>the course notes is that the speeds of signals that
  we are</span> <span m='147000'>going to consider are going to be much slower
  than the speed of</span> <span m='151000'>light. OK, so we're going to
  be</span> <span m='156000'>working in a realm where we are going to be well
  slower than the</span> <span m='165000'>speed of light. OK, so starting with
  that,</span> <span m='170000'>let me walk you through some examples and some
  fun stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='178000'>So, the first case is called the
  Double Take.</span> </p><p><span m='186000'>So, let me sketch out a small
  little circuit for you,</span> <span m='191000'>and take a look at the
  expected behavior, and then show you what</span> <span m='197000'>really
  happens in real life. So, the first case,</span> <span m='202000'>I have a
  voltage source, and what I'm going to do is</span> <span m='208000'>make a
  transition from a zero to a one.</span> </p><p><span m='213000'>Think of it as
  a step input, and through a Thevenin like</span> <span m='219000'>resistance,
  I want to feed it to a circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='225000'>The circuit
  will go to an inverter.</span> </p><p><span m='229000'>This node goes to an
  inverter, and goes through some other</span> <span m='236000'>circuits within
  our own design here.</span> </p><p><span m='242000'>So, again, remember, a
  step input here,</span> <span m='245000'>and this input goes through a
  Thevenin like resistance,</span> <span m='251000'>or is applied to some other
  circuit elements.</span> </p><p><span m='255000'>So, if I apply a step here,
  what do you expect?</span> </p><p><span m='260000'>You expect that, so let me
  call that VI,</span> <span m='264000'>and let me call that Vo. So, if I plot
  VI as a function</span> <span m='269000'>of time, and let's say this step
  input happens at t=0.</span> </p><p><span m='276000'>So let's say this is t=0
  here, and let's say this is a 5V</span> <span m='284000'>step. So, I expect
  that this input</span> <span m='289000'>here is going to go to, VI here, is
  going to go to 5V</span> <span m='297000'>at t=0. What do I expect at
  Vo?</span> </p><p><span m='303000'>At Vo, based on our circuit abstraction, I
  get a step input</span> <span m='307000'>here. I should get a step of
  some</span> <span m='309000'>magnitude here, depending on what's
  connected</span> <span m='312000'>in this direction. And let's simply say
  that</span> <span m='316000'>what's connected here is an inverter, and maybe
  other</span> <span m='319000'>inverters at the other side. So
  essentially,</span> <span m='323000'>as far as this node is concerned, it's
  got some wires</span> <span m='326000'>connected to it. And at the end of the
  wires,</span> <span m='330000'>it has an open circuit, an open circuit,</span>
  <span m='332000'>for example, like the gate input of this</span> <span
  m='335000'>inverter. So what do you expect at V</span> <span
  m='341000'>nought? A step input here,</span> <span m='344000'>and at V nought
  I see an open circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='349000'>OK, so I expect the same
  step at V nought: 5V.</span> </p><p><span m='354000'>So, that's what we've
  prepared you for, OK?</span> </p><p><span m='361000'>But, the fun thing that
  we're going to see,</span> <span m='364000'>so this is what you expect, and
  I'll show you a little demo</span> <span m='369000'>that is going to show you
  something very different.</span> </p><p><span m='373000'>What you're going to
  see is not this.</span> </p><p><span m='376000'>OK, you're not going to be
  seeing that.</span> </p><p><span m='379000'>Rather, I'm going to show you
  something that looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='396000'>So, at t=0, I
  do see Vo looking like a step, and approximately</span> <span
  m='400000'>halfway through, decides, ah,</span> <span m='403000'>well never
  mind, and flattens out,</span> <span m='405000'>OK, then says, oh, OK, and
  zoom,</span> <span m='408000'>it goes back up to 5V. So, it sort of does a bit
  of a</span> <span m='412000'>double take up there saying, hey, what's going on
  here?</span> </p><p><span m='417000'>And zoom, jumps up to 5V, and then it's
  five as you</span> <span m='421000'>expect. OK, so this is some finite</span>
  <span m='425000'>amount of time that looks like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='429000'>OK, so try to understand what's going on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='434000'>So let me show you a quick little demo.</span> </p><p><span
  m='438000'>So that's the input VI. OK, so that's the input VI that</span>
  <span m='444000'>you expect, and I won't do anything to my circuit at
  this</span> <span m='450000'>point. And, go ahead.</span> </p><p><span
  m='454000'>So, let's see what happens now. There you go.</span> </p><p><span
  m='457000'>So now, I'm showing you the output here at Vo.</span> </p><p><span
  m='461000'>So at VI, there's a nice little step, and at Vo,</span> <span
  m='464000'>notice that I get something that behaves like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='468000'>OK, and I promise you, nothing we've taught you
  in</span> <span m='472000'>6.002 prepares you for this. OK, and as I mentioned
  at the</span> <span m='477000'>beginning of this lecture, it would behoove you
  to forget</span> <span m='481000'>about everything you learn in today's
  lecture for the next two</span> <span m='486000'>weeks at least. So what's
  going on here?</span> </p><p><span m='491000'>Any ideas? Anybody?</span>
  </p><p><span m='492000'>Any thoughts? So what's up with my circuit</span>
  <span m='496000'>here? It says, oh,</span> <span m='497000'>OK, a step. It
  starts off and says,</span> <span m='500000'>oh, never mind, and then meanders
  along at 2.5V</span> <span m='504000'>and then says oh, step, yes, I
  remember,</span> <span m='508000'>and then boom, it jumps up to 5V.</span>
  </p><p><span m='512000'>So, any theories? Any guesses?</span> </p><p><span
  m='515000'>Any wild guesses? OK, so let me draw you a little</span> <span
  m='520000'>bit more of a detailed circuit, and see if you can explain</span>
  <span m='526000'>what's going on here. So, the circuit that I've drawn</span>
  <span m='532000'>there is not quite the circuit I have at least in terms of
  my</span> <span m='538000'>wires. So, what I have is something</span> <span
  m='542000'>that looks like this, VI, and this is going to step</span> <span
  m='547000'>to 5V. I do have a resistance,</span> <span m='553000'>R. This is
  Vo, this does go to an</span> <span m='558000'>inverter. But what is also
  happening is</span> <span m='564000'>that I have a long wire. OK, you see this
  guy here?</span> </p><p><span m='574000'>We had one of our union folks stretch
  out along the floor</span> <span m='579000'>here. We have a really long wire
  that</span> <span m='582000'>connects to the Vo node, and there's also a
  long</span> <span m='586000'>corresponding ground. So, this wire is a
  coaxial</span> <span m='591000'>cable that is used for Ethernet and such
  like.</span> </p><p><span m='595000'>It's got a core that carries a signal,
  and around the core is</span> <span m='601000'>shielding that is the ground.
  OK, so that goes a long way,</span> <span m='607000'>and at the end, it is
  open.</span> </p><p><span m='610000'>OK, it's an open circuit at the
  end.</span> </p><p><span m='614000'>I haven't connected anything out there:
  open circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='619000'>So, you know, something's
  happening here</span> <span m='623000'>that's making the circuit behave like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='628000'>So, this is VI. At Vo --</span> <span
  m='648000'>So at Vo I'm getting this funny behavior.</span> </p><p><span
  m='651000'>OK, so does anybody want to take the next piece of clues</span>
  <span m='655000'>here, does anybody want to take a stab at guessing what might
  be</span> <span m='660000'>going on here? Yes?</span> </p><p><span
  m='662000'>Ah, we have a shill in the audience here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='666000'>So, the theory is that the step here, think of it as an</span>
  <span m='671000'>electromagnetic pulse that goes from zero to five,</span>
  <span m='676000'>and things in real life don't travel instantaneously.</span>
  </p><p><span m='681000'>So, there's something with a wave that flies
  down,</span> <span m='686000'>and the wave goes to the end, flips, and then
  comes back,</span> <span m='692000'>and then establishes the full voltage
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='698000'>So that is indeed at the root of what's
  going on.</span> </p><p><span m='701000'>And let me put it in layman's terms
  and then describe the</span> <span m='706000'>details of what's going on here.
  OK, so the way to view what's</span> <span m='711000'>going on is that I have
  this long wire.</span> </p><p><span m='714000'>OK, in the very first lecture,
  I started off by saying wires</span> <span m='719000'>are ideal. OK, ideal
  wires are such that I</span> <span m='723000'>can transmit signals on them.
  Wires are small so that the</span> <span m='726000'>propagation time of
  signals is inconsequential compared to the</span> <span m='731000'>rise times
  and fall times of the signals of interest.</span> </p><p><span m='734000'>By
  having this really long cable here, I have clearly</span> <span
  m='738000'>violated that assumption, which is the wires are really,</span>
  <span m='741000'>really long here. OK, and so I somehow need to</span> <span
  m='745000'>model what the wire is doing to my circuit when I don't have
  a</span> <span m='749000'>small wire. So what actually happens,</span> <span
  m='753000'>the way to view it is the following.</span> </p><p><span
  m='757000'>So, although this is a wire, to understand the mechanics of</span>
  <span m='762000'>what's going on, I really have to model it much</span> <span
  m='767000'>more accurately, OK?</span> </p><p><span m='769000'>And, the way to
  model a wire like this is that notice that</span> <span m='775000'>every small
  element of a wire has associated with it some</span> <span
  m='780000'>inductance. OK, so let's take a small</span> <span
  m='784000'>segment of the coax cable here. The coax cable is a small
  core</span> <span m='789000'>surrounded by a metallic shield. OK, that's a
  ground.</span> </p><p><span m='794000'>And so, when I have a wire surrounded
  by a metallic shield,</span> <span m='798000'>that also has the capacitance,
  OK, inductance and capacitance.</span> </p><p><span m='803000'>So this small
  segment can be modeled as a really small</span> <span m='807000'>inductance,
  and a really tiny capacitance.</span> </p><p><span m='812000'>Similarly, the
  next segment can be modeled as a tiny inductance</span> <span m='816000'>and a
  capacitance. There is also a resistance</span> <span m='820000'>here, but
  let's assume that the resistance is zero for our</span> <span
  m='824000'>model, and also the parallel resistance is also infinity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='829000'>OK, so it's an inductor, capacitor, and really
  the</span> <span m='832000'>situation that I have is not a pair of ideal
  wires,</span> <span m='836000'>but really a really, really small
  inductance,</span> <span m='840000'>and a small capacitance in
  parallel.</span> </p><p><span m='844000'>So, it's more of a set of distributed
  elements that I have</span> <span m='848000'>here. Notice that in my lump
  circuit</span> <span m='851000'>abstraction, when we talked about the RLC
  model for the wire</span> <span m='855000'>between two inverters, we lumped
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='858000'>We lumped this thing into a model that
  looked like this.</span> </p><p><span m='862000'>OK, we lumped the resistance
  into a source resistance.</span> </p><p><span m='867000'>We lumped all the
  inductors into a lumped inductor.</span> </p><p><span m='872000'>We lumped all
  the capacitances into a lumped capacitance.</span> </p><p><span m='876000'>OK,
  but in this situation, I can do this when the signal</span> <span
  m='880000'>speeds of interest are much, much, much slower than the</span>
  <span m='884000'>speed of light than the propagation speeds of</span> <span
  m='888000'>electromagnetic signals. In this case,</span> <span m='890000'>that
  is not quite true. And so, therefore,</span> <span m='894000'>we have to model
  it much more exactly.</span> </p><p><span m='896000'>We need to see what's
  going on. So, what's happening here is</span> <span m='901000'>that at t=0, I
  get this step. So, think of that as a pulse of</span> <span m='907000'>energy,
  and the instant it comes here, and instantaneously this</span> <span
  m='911000'>guy looks like a voltage divider, OK?</span> </p><p><span
  m='914000'>I've chosen my resistance, R, here to match the</span> <span
  m='918000'>instantaneous impedance looking in, which is also R.</span>
  </p><p><span m='921000'>I've arranged it to be that way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='924000'>So, instantaneously, the point at which the pulse</span> <span
  m='927000'>appears at this point, looking down here looks like</span> <span
  m='931000'>another resistor to this pulse. OK, therefore,</span> <span
  m='935000'>when I start out, I start out going up and</span> <span
  m='938000'>pausing at 2.5 because instantaneously,</span> <span
  m='941000'>this looks like a resistance, R.</span> </p><p><span m='943000'>So
  instantaneously, it's a voltage divider,</span> <span m='946000'>R, and so
  it's 2.5 here, instantaneously.</span> </p><p><span m='949000'>OK, then what
  happens? Then those little pulse</span> <span m='952000'>propagates down. What
  does it mean for a pulse</span> <span m='955000'>of energy to propagate down?
  Well, it begins sending a</span> <span m='958000'>current through the
  inductor, begins charging up the</span> <span m='962000'>capacitor, current
  here, so that's what I mean by saying</span> <span m='966000'>that the pulse
  of energy goes down.</span> </p><p><span m='970000'>OK, it's a step that sends
  current to the inductor and</span> <span m='974000'>charges of the capacitors,
  and that wave front moves out</span> <span m='979000'>here and comes all the
  way here. What happens there?</span> </p><p><span m='983000'>Well, think about
  it. Supposing you stand here,</span> <span m='987000'>and you hold a long
  string in your hand somehow,</span> <span m='991000'>and just do this Gedanken
  experiment.</span> </p><p><span m='995000'>It's not easy to do. And so, let's
  say you somehow</span> <span m='998000'>have the long string that you're
  holding onto,</span> <span m='1001000'>and the string on the other side is not
  connected to</span> <span m='1005000'>anything. OK, just imagine this</span>
  <span m='1007000'>experiment. OK, and what you do is you</span> <span
  m='1010000'>suddenly raise the string up at your end by about a foot.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1014000'>What are you going to see happen?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1016000'>So instantaneously, the string is up here,</span> <span
  m='1019000'>but the rest of the string is down a foot below.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1024000'>And then you see this wave propagate down the
  string,</span> <span m='1027000'>right? So here's a string.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1029000'>I lift this thing, and you see this wave
  propagate</span> <span m='1032000'>all the way down, the one foot wave
  propagate all</span> <span m='1035000'>the way down until you come
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1037000'>What happens here? So, out here,</span>
  <span m='1040000'>the string is down here, the wave propagates out here</span>
  <span m='1043000'>and pulls it up to one. And then what?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1046000'>There's nothing connected there, so the string is zipped</span>
  <span m='1049000'>up, but it's got the energy. OK, where does energy
  go?</span> </p><p><span m='1054000'>Well, it continues going up, and sends a
  wave back.</span> </p><p><span m='1057000'>OK, so just think of a string that
  you pull up like this and</span> <span m='1060000'>propagates down, boom, hits
  the other end,</span> <span m='1063000'>reverses, and comes back at me. OK,
  you can look at a</span> <span m='1066000'>complementary situation, not the
  same as this,</span> <span m='1068000'>but complementary by taking a string,
  tying it to a door,</span> <span m='1071000'>and lifting it up. It's not the
  same situation.</span> </p><p><span m='1074000'>It's a complementary situation
  where it's tied down.</span> </p><p><span m='1077000'>Tying down a string is
  tantamount to shorting the ends</span> <span m='1080000'>here. OK, in that
  case what you'll</span> <span m='1083000'>see happen: as the wave goes down,
  at the end the string</span> <span m='1087000'>can't move, so the wave goes
  and flips around and comes back.</span> </p><p><span m='1091000'>Try it out at
  home. Take a long piece of string,</span> <span m='1093000'>tie it up there,
  do this, OK?</span> </p><p><span m='1095000'>And you'll see the wave go out,
  flip, and then come back at</span> <span m='1099000'>you. So, if your friends
  see you</span> <span m='1101000'>tying a long piece of string doing this,
  hopefully they won't</span> <span m='1105000'>think you're nuts or something.
  OK, so the same way here:</span> <span m='1109000'>this thing flies down, OK,
  there's no way to dissipate</span> <span m='1113000'>the energy here, so this
  thing continues up.</span> </p><p><span m='1115000'>And then, what I'm going
  to see happen is the wave move back.</span> </p><p><span m='1119000'>OK, the
  wave begins to move back, and that's another 2.5V,</span> <span
  m='1123000'>resulting in a net 5V at this terminal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1126000'>That wave begins to blast back, OK, and then when it comes
  back</span> <span m='1130000'>here, after some amount of time, it raises this
  to 5V,</span> <span m='1133000'>and that's what you see happen here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1136000'>So, this is a wave going down, and then after a
  time,</span> <span m='1139000'>2t, it goes back up to 5V. That's a return
  wave.</span> </p><p><span m='1144000'>It's 2t because to get down here is t
  seconds,</span> <span m='1147000'>and then t seconds to come back, which is
  why we have 2t.</span> </p><p><span m='1152000'>OK, that is why you see that
  pulse at 2.5.</span> </p><p><span m='1155000'>OK, so I'd like to show you a
  few more things here.</span> </p><p><span m='1159000'>Clearly we don't want
  that in our circuits.</span> </p><p><span m='1162000'>Could someone tell me
  what problem would happen if my</span> <span m='1167000'>signals looked like
  this in my digital circuits?</span> </p><p><span m='1172000'>Instead of being
  nice little steps, if there was a little</span> <span m='1179000'>thing in the
  middle and then a step, what's the problem with</span> <span
  m='1186000'>signals like this? In digital circuits,</span> <span
  m='1191000'>what did it violate? Yeah?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1194000'>Exactly. This little sucker here is</span> <span
  m='1199000'>meandering out in the forbidden region for all of 2T.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1205000'>Can't do that. OK, can't have that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1210000'>Well, so we need to fix the problem because this is
  real</span> <span m='1217000'>life. OK, but what if you and your</span> <span
  m='1220000'>buddy were signaling each other but using digital signals
  from</span> <span m='1223000'>one dorm room to another maybe a few hundred
  feet down?</span> </p><p><span m='1224000'>Your circuit isn't going to work
  because the signal's going</span> <span m='1226000'>to meander around in the
  forbidden region for some time.</span> </p><p><span m='1228000'>So, any ideas
  what might you do?</span> </p><p><span m='1229000'>Yeah? Put a resistor on the
  end.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>OK, trick the circuit. So, what you can
  do,</span> <span m='1232000'>and I'm going to show you a little demo
  here,</span> <span m='1233000'>what you can do is the reason I got this wave
  propagating back,</span> <span m='1235000'>was that there was nothing to
  absorb the energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1238000'>So instead, what if I put
  another resistor here,</span> <span m='1241000'>R? So, as far as a burst of
  energy</span> <span m='1244000'>is concerned, it says, oh,</span> <span
  m='1246000'>yeah, it just looks the same. It's R, and goes and
  dissipates</span> <span m='1250000'>in this resistor, R, and guess
  what?</span> </p><p><span m='1253000'>I don't have any wave going back, and
  I'm done.</span> </p><p><span m='1256000'>So, what I'm going to find, then, is
  that out here,</span> <span m='1260000'>this goes up to 5V, but out
  here,</span> <span m='1263000'>I will have a signal that starts out and goes
  up to 2.5,</span> <span m='1267000'>and that's it. OK, I lift it up,</span>
  <span m='1271000'>it goes down, it goes to 2.5 because in the</span> <span
  m='1274000'>lumped model that you've been dealing with,</span> <span
  m='1277000'>it's a resistor R, a resistor R to ground,</span> <span
  m='1280000'>and you're taking the connection here or here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1283000'>So, it's your standard lumped model, your voltage resistive</span>
  <span m='1287000'>divider, and it just simply works.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1289000'>Yeah, that's it. So, this is the end of the</span> <span
  m='1294000'>cable. OK, if somehow you could watch</span> <span
  m='1297000'>this and that at the same time, so what I'm going to do,</span>
  <span m='1303000'>and this is a resistor, R, I'm just going to plug it</span>
  <span m='1307000'>in. OK, if the fates are smiling at</span> <span
  m='1311000'>me, what should you see there? What should happen is that
  the</span> <span m='1316000'>second jump from 2.5 to 5 should simply go
  away.</span> </p><p><span m='1321000'>It should just go to 2.5. Let's try
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='1326000'>There you go. I take it out,</span>
  <span m='1330000'>it jumps back up. OK, so all I've done here is</span> <span
  m='1336000'>put in a resistor at the end, and I'm still measuring the</span>
  <span m='1344000'>voltage here. So, that's one solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1350000'>One solution is to put a resistor here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1352000'>So, I absorb the energy, and the resistance has to be</span> <span
  m='1356000'>equal to the instantaneous impedance looking in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1359000'>And the instantaneous impedance, for many of
  these</span> <span m='1362000'>cables is 50 ohms. It's called a
  characteristic</span> <span m='1365000'>impedance. OK, you'll learn a lot
  more</span> <span m='1367000'>about it if you take 6.014. That course starts
  out with</span> <span m='1371000'>assuming that things are distributed in that
  matter.</span> </p><p><span m='1376000'>OK, so if you want to design
  multi-gigahertz chips,</span> <span m='1379000'>it turns out that if you have
  signals that are traveling</span> <span m='1384000'>around at edge speeds in
  the 0.1-1 nanosecond range,</span> <span m='1388000'>remember, light travels
  roughly one nanosecond a foot.</span> </p><p><span m='1392000'>And if the
  signals are roughly of interest are 0.1 nanoseconds,</span> <span
  m='1396000'>then if the chips are one inch in size, right there,</span> <span
  m='1400000'>the propagation speed of a signal across a chip is 0.1</span>
  <span m='1404000'>nanoseconds. OK, so today,</span> <span m='1406000'>we have
  to deal with these issues and try to figure out</span> <span m='1410000'>what
  to do about them. OK, so that's one solution that</span> <span
  m='1416000'>somebody pointed out. There is a second solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1420000'>Anybody else have a second solution for me?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1423000'>And then there's a third solution, too.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1426000'>So it's OK. You can give me either the</span> <span
  m='1429000'>second or the third solution. It doesn't matter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1433000'>Anybody? You have two to choose from,</span> <span
  m='1436000'>come on. Yeah?</span> </p><p><span m='1437000'>You can do that,
  yeah.</span> </p><p><span m='1440000'>So we could define the problem away by
  saying this transition</span> <span m='1445000'>is such that my high is
  below</span> <span m='1447000'>So, once it goes above 2.5, who cares what it
  does?</span> </p><p><span m='1452000'>That's a good point. That's solution
  number four,</span> <span m='1456000'>and that works. OK, so I still need two
  and</span> <span m='1459000'>three. Put a diode in there?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1461000'>Yeah, I guess you could. If the diode had the same kind</span>
  <span m='1466000'>of impedance looking in, it kind of may work.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1470000'>That's solution 4.2. I'm still waiting for
  solution</span> <span m='1474000'>two and three. Pardon?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1477000'>Cut off the cable? Exactly.</span> </p><p><span m='1480000'>So,
  the solution says, work on a different problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1485000'>And that is solution number two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1489000'>OK, so the idea is, the root of all evil,</span> <span
  m='1493000'>this long wire, which is why I had this thing</span> <span
  m='1498000'>here. So instead, if I had short</span> <span m='1502000'>wires,
  then what will happen is if it's a very small wire,</span> <span
  m='1507000'>it'll look like this. And the wire's small enough.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1512000'>I will see an itty-bitty thingamajig out
  there,</span> <span m='1516000'>but not a whole lot. By the way, the fun thing
  is</span> <span m='1520000'>that you can actually calculate the speed of
  light,</span> <span m='1525000'>the experiment I just showed you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1528000'>Can we put that up again? No, the big one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1533000'>So, in the experiment that I showed you, this
  distance was</span> <span m='1537000'>about 500 nanoseconds, OK?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1539000'>This distance was 500 nanoseconds this time
  interval.</span> </p><p><span m='1542000'>The length of this cable is about
  500 feet,</span> <span m='1546000'>somewhere around 500 feet. So you can
  figure out the speed</span> <span m='1550000'>of light. What's the speed of
  light?</span> </p><p><span m='1552000'>So, this is about 500 nanoseconds, and
  this cable is</span> <span m='1556000'>roughly 500 feet. What's the speed of
  light?</span> </p><p><span m='1561000'>Roughly a foot per nanosecond. So,
  would you believe that in</span> <span m='1564000'>6.002 we've figured out the
  speed of light from a simple</span> <span m='1568000'>experiment? All right,
  so let's do the next</span> <span m='1571000'>experiment now. Let's take out
  the long cable,</span> <span m='1574000'>and connect a short cable
  instead.</span> </p><p><span m='1576000'>So, what I'm going to do is
  disconnect the long cable,</span> <span m='1580000'>and instead, connect a
  small cable.</span> </p><p><span m='1582000'>It's still relatively long, but
  much shorter than the 500</span> <span m='1586000'>foot cable. So what you
  should see happen</span> <span m='1588000'>now is that the little step should
  not be this big,</span> <span m='1592000'>but much, much smaller. So, take a
  look up there.</span> </p><p><span m='1597000'>There you go. OK, so with this
  thingamajig,</span> <span m='1600000'>the little blip there is very
  small.</span> </p><p><span m='1603000'>And of course, if I make it even
  smaller,</span> <span m='1607000'>then that can virtually vanish. OK, so that
  is solution number</span> <span m='1612000'>two. So, we've done one,</span>
  <span m='1614000'>two, four, 4.2. So, what's solution number</span> <span
  m='1618000'>three? One more solution.</span> </p><p><span m='1621000'>Pardon?
  So, another solution we</span> <span m='1624000'>mentioned is we change this
  resistance.</span> </p><p><span m='1628000'>and that will work, if I make this
  very,</span> <span m='1631000'>very low, then I'll get much closer to 5V
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1636000'>Yeah, that's a possibility. That's
  solution six I guess.</span> </p><p><span m='1641000'>So what was solution
  number three?</span> </p><p><span m='1644000'>And you all should be able to
  solve this.</span> </p><p><span m='1650000'>You guys know the answer. OK, you
  folks should be able to</span> <span m='1654000'>solve this. Yes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1655000'>Ah, clock. So, what I can do is just as</span> <span
  m='1658000'>was pointed out, that I leveraged my abstraction</span> <span
  m='1662000'>by changing my VOH and VIH thresholds.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1665000'>So that'll work. The alternative thing is to use</span> <span
  m='1669000'>a clock. A clock is a distinguished</span> <span
  m='1672000'>signal that I send around in my digital circuit,</span> <span
  m='1676000'>OK? So all I do is if I arrange it</span> <span m='1680000'>such
  that my clock doesn't happen in this vicinity,</span> <span m='1684000'>but
  rather, my clock happens late enough, then I'm going to</span> <span
  m='1690000'>sample and look at my signals only on the rising and
  falling</span> <span m='1695000'>edges of the clock, in which case I won't
  be</span> <span m='1698000'>looking at the signal, but the signal is doing
  weird</span> <span m='1703000'>things. OK, so a decent clock would</span>
  <span m='1706000'>also solve the problem. OK, any last minute questions</span>
  <span m='1710000'>before we go onto the next one? OK, the next problem that
  we're</span> <span m='1720000'>going to look at is titled the Double
  Dip.</span> </p><p><span m='1727000'>OK, so what I'm going to do here is our
  Vs power supply,</span> <span m='1736000'>and what I'm going to do is feed the
  power supply to an</span> <span m='1746000'>inverter. OK, so we've been doing
  this</span> <span m='1752000'>all along; Vs, I feed the supply to an</span>
  <span m='1756000'>inverter. And what I'm also going to do</span> <span
  m='1760000'>is, so this is ground, and I'm going to feed it to,</span> <span
  m='1766000'>so feed the power supply connection to a couple of</span> <span
  m='1771000'>inverters. OK, and what I'm going to do is</span> <span
  m='1779000'>apply some sort of a signal to this inverter,</span> <span
  m='1787000'>and I'm going to observe, and I'm going to look at this</span>
  <span m='1797000'>signal here. So, the abstraction should tell</span> <span
  m='1803000'>you that here's a power supply. This is 5V, or whatever the</span>
  <span m='1807000'>supply voltage is to these two inverters.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1810000'>That should be fine, and feed some sort of input
  to</span> <span m='1814000'>this inverter, OK, and the output here
  should</span> <span m='1818000'>be simply determined by this input.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1820000'>This signal can have absolutely no bearing on this
  output.</span> </p><p><span m='1825000'>OK, and let's look at that and
  actually confirm it.</span> </p><p><span m='1830000'>So, I build a circuit
  like this, and we look at this</span> <span m='1835000'>output, and initially
  there should not be any,</span> <span m='1840000'>it should simply work fine.
  OK, so it should work now,</span> <span m='1846000'>right? OK.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1847000'>So what you have here, this input here is the
  input</span> <span m='1853000'>that I'm feeding to this inverter.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1856000'>That is a straight line. Is that the power
  supply?</span> </p><p><span m='1862000'>It doesn't matter? OK, so I believe
  this is the,</span> <span m='1866000'>we'll check in a few minutes, but I
  suspect this is the power</span> <span m='1870000'>supply, and this guy here
  is the output looking here.</span> </p><p><span m='1874000'>So, the green one
  is the look here part.</span> </p><p><span m='1877000'>So, there must have
  been a one-to-zero transition here,</span> <span m='1881000'>and that's all
  fine. So, so far, so good.</span> </p><p><span m='1884000'>OK, no problem so
  far. Now what I'm going to do is I'm</span> <span m='1888000'>going to do
  something to the circuit that as far as</span> <span m='1892000'>abstraction
  is concerned, it doesn't show up on the</span> <span m='1895000'>circuit. OK,
  it's below the abstraction</span> <span m='1901000'>layer. OK, I'm going to do
  something,</span> <span m='1905000'>and suddenly, some things are going
  to</span> <span m='1908000'>happen. Look up there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1911000'>The circuit hasn't changed. It's the same circuit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1916000'>I've done nothing to the circuit.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1919000'>OK, look at the green output. I've done nothing to the</span>
  <span m='1925000'>circuit that is visible here. OK, it's below the radar
  screen</span> <span m='1929000'>here. It's below the abstraction</span> <span
  m='1931000'>barrier. But, look at the disaster here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1934000'>OK, in particular, the spikes going up are not so</span> <span
  m='1937000'>much of a problem. Because of the static</span> <span
  m='1940000'>discipline, if I am at five or six or seven,</span> <span
  m='1943000'>it doesn't matter as long as I am higher than VOH.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1947000'>So as long as I'm higher than VOH I don't have a
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='1952000'>But the problems are these repeated
  dips.</span> </p><p><span m='1954000'>OK, the dips are a problem here, which
  is why I labeled</span> <span m='1958000'>this experiment the Double Dip. OK,
  the dips are bad because if</span> <span m='1962000'>they are large enough,
  they can then group the output</span> <span m='1966000'>down into the
  forbidden region, or worse yet,</span> <span m='1969000'>make it look like a
  zero. OK, so you're not prepared for</span> <span m='1973000'>this. So what
  I'm going to do is tell</span> <span m='1975000'>you what I did to the
  circuit, and then ask you to help me</span> <span m='1979000'>figure it out.
  So all I did was applied a load</span> <span m='1988000'>resistance to this, I
  think of 50 ohms or some RL.</span> </p><p><span m='1997000'>I just applied a
  load resistor. And this inverter here,</span> <span m='2008000'>I believe, is
  a CMOS inverter that looks, OK?</span> </p><p><span m='2018000'>So I have this
  input applied to this inverter,</span> <span m='2021000'>and all I did is I
  applied an RL load here.</span> </p><p><span m='2023000'>And notice that the
  load here should not really change what's</span> <span m='2028000'>happening
  if this is an ideal inverter, OK,</span> <span m='2030000'>the load here
  should simply draw some current but really</span> <span m='2034000'>should not
  change any other property.</span> </p><p><span m='2038000'>OK, so just
  remember, what's the signal doing?</span> </p><p><span m='2042000'>The signal
  is high. This guy turns on,</span> <span m='2045000'>and current flows like
  this. So, let's say I had some sort</span> <span m='2050000'>of a capacitor
  here. This charges like this,</span> <span m='2054000'>and when it's slow, the
  PFET is on,</span> <span m='2057000'>and current flows through here down
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2060000'>And then when this goes high, this guy
  goes off,</span> <span m='2065000'>and this guy turns on. OK, so the current
  flows out</span> <span m='2069000'>this way and this charges through this
  guy.</span> </p><p><span m='2075000'>When I turn it off, the P fret turns on
  and draws</span> <span m='2079000'>current from the top. OK, so do we have any
  theories</span> <span m='2084000'>as to why I'm getting that messy stuff, the
  dips and the spikes,</span> <span m='2090000'>on the output of this inverter?
  So why does this inverter care</span> <span m='2096000'>what the load of this
  inverter is?</span> </p><p><span m='2099000'>I mean, who cares? So, put your
  thinking caps on.</span> </p><p><span m='2104000'>Any theories? You guys did
  pretty well with</span> <span m='2108000'>the previous one. And this is much
  easier,</span> <span m='2111000'>actually. Need a better power supply;</span>
  <span m='2115000'>OK, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to replace the
  power</span> <span m='2120000'>supply, and instead, use a much bigger power
  supply</span> <span m='2124000'>at 5V. A big, mongo power supply that</span>
  <span m='2128000'>can supply 100 amps, and guess what,</span> <span
  m='2131000'>I've made the changes, but guess what,</span> <span m='2134000'>I
  still see the spikes. Good try, but it didn't work</span> <span
  m='2141000'>out. Good try, good try.</span> </p><p><span m='2143000'>What
  next? Any other solutions?</span> </p><p><span m='2146000'>Yes? So dips are
  because of the</span> <span m='2150000'>resistance, and the spikes are because
  of the inductance?</span> </p><p><span m='2156000'>You're half correct. So,
  which one is it?</span> </p><p><span m='2162000'>So, dips are because of
  resistances, and spikes are</span> <span m='2167000'>because of inductances.
  You're half correct.</span> </p><p><span m='2171000'>It turns out that both
  the dips and the spikes are because of</span> <span m='2177000'>inductances.
  OK, but be that as it may,</span> <span m='2181000'>let me give you the next
  clue here, and then see if you can</span> <span m='2187000'>come closer to the
  answer. So, what I've done here is I've</span> <span m='2193000'>made this
  wire really, really long.</span> </p><p><span m='2198000'>OK, it's a really
  long wire, OK, but it's a thick wire,</span> <span m='2201000'>so it's a long,
  long, thick wire.</span> </p><p><span m='2204000'>So it's not the resistance.
  It's really,</span> <span m='2206000'>really thick and mongo, and it's a long
  wire,</span> <span m='2210000'>so a signal wire above a ground plane behaves
  like an inductor.</span> </p><p><span m='2214000'>And so here, it has the
  capacitance to,</span> <span m='2217000'>but in this case it's
  inductance.</span> </p><p><span m='2219000'>It's inductance here. So, I'll
  give you another ten</span> <span m='2224000'>seconds to think about it and
  then tell you the answer.</span> </p><p><span m='2230000'>But despite the
  inductance here, it turns out if I take out</span> <span m='2235000'>this
  resistor, the problem goes away.</span> </p><p><span m='2239000'>Look, I take
  out the resistor, the problem goes away.</span> </p><p><span m='2244000'>Yes,
  there is an inductor here. OK, I take out this resistor,</span> <span
  m='2254000'>problem goes away. I put the resistor back in,</span> <span
  m='2264000'>boom. Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='2266000'>OK, pretty good. That's
  86 points.</span> </p><p><span m='2274000'>So here's what's going on. There's
  an inductor here,</span> <span m='2283000'>and when I put a 50 ohm resistor
  here,</span> <span m='2286000'>I put this resistor. When the PFET turns
  on,</span> <span m='2290000'>it draws a current. OK, it's going to draw
  a</span> <span m='2293000'>current. It draws a current;</span> <span
  m='2295000'>remember that across an inductor, I have a drop.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2299000'>And the drop relates to the di/dt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2302000'>Remember, for a capacitor, the current is
  Cdv/dt.</span> </p><p><span m='2306000'>For the inductor, the voltage across
  the inductor</span> <span m='2309000'>is Ldi/dt. So, if di/dt,</span> <span
  m='2313000'>from switching a large current through the inductor every</span>
  <span m='2317000'>cycle, OK, big di/dt, di/dt is large.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2320000'>I've made it large by having a very small RL,</span> <span
  m='2324000'>so, you know, pulling a big current through</span> <span
  m='2327000'>every few, whatever, every cycle,</span> <span m='2330000'>and
  then stopping it. And so therefore,</span> <span m='2333000'>I'm getting these
  big drops across this inductor that relate</span> <span m='2338000'>to Ldi/dt.
  In other words,</span> <span m='2340000'>the power supply here is fine. While
  you guys were watching,</span> <span m='2345000'>I switched to the huge, mongo
  power supply,</span> <span m='2348000'>and so this voltage is fine. But then
  this voltage after the</span> <span m='2352000'>wire is the problem. So, this
  voltage here doesn't</span> <span m='2356000'>look like this anymore. Rather,
  it has spikes that go</span> <span m='2359000'>down, for example, and when I
  switch the other</span> <span m='2362000'>way, they go up. OK, so
  therefore,</span> <span m='2364000'>what I end up having here is big spikes on
  this power supply.</span> </p><p><span m='2370000'>And when this guy's power
  supply goes wacko,</span> <span m='2373000'>then I see the spikes on its
  output as well.</span> </p><p><span m='2377000'>OK, so what are the solutions
  for that?</span> </p><p><span m='2380000'>Any solutions here? What can I do to
  fix the</span> <span m='2383000'>problem? Pardon?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2385000'>Stop using the, exactly.</span> </p><p><span m='2386000'>When in
  doubt, do something else.</span> </p><p><span m='2389000'>Build a different
  design. So what I could do is this is</span> <span m='2394000'>pretty dumb,
  using a long wire. And so, no, but trust me,</span> <span
  m='2399000'>oftentimes you go to the store room and they give you a big</span>
  <span m='2404000'>roll of wire, and you're too lazy to cut a</span> <span
  m='2407000'>piece out. Use the whole roll,</span> <span m='2410000'>and use
  the two ends, and connect it in,</span> <span m='2413000'>OK? So, if I had a
  much shorter</span> <span m='2415000'>piece of wire, then that can solve my
  problem.</span> </p><p><span m='2418000'>But again, remember, what's small to
  you may not be</span> <span m='2422000'>small to the circuit. OK, so let's
  say,</span> <span m='2425000'>for example, I'm Intel, and I'm building
  a</span> <span m='2429000'>10 GHz Pentium 6 processor. OK, it's 0.1 nanosecond
  is my</span> <span m='2433000'>cycle time. There, even a small,</span> <span
  m='2437000'>itty bitty wire can be a real problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2440000'>OK, and so therefore, distributing power throughout a</span> <span
  m='2444000'>one inch chip that's clocking at 10 GHz is a really,</span> <span
  m='2447000'>really hard problem. And our own David Perreault,</span> <span
  m='2451000'>who is doing one of our sections, is one of the world's</span>
  <span m='2455000'>experts in this field. Distributing power,</span> <span
  m='2458000'>something as simple as, how do I get 1V in a stable</span> <span
  m='2462000'>manner to every single device on my chip?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2465000'>It's a hard problem. OK, so now, you have to begin</span> <span
  m='2470000'>feeding your power supply connections much like RC</span> <span
  m='2475000'>circuits, OK, and you have to solve some hard</span> <span
  m='2479000'>problems to be able to simply distribute power decently</span>
  <span m='2485000'>throughout your circuit. So, what else can I do?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2489000'>Yeah? Say it again?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2492000'>Ah, I can do that. I could use different wires to</span> <span
  m='2495000'>connect each of the inverters. That's a good point.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2499000'>So here, the coupling happens because I connect the
  two</span> <span m='2504000'>inverters way out here. So instead, I use a
  different</span> <span m='2508000'>cable. I hadn't thought of that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2510000'>That's a creative solution. OK, so in fact,</span>
  <span m='2514000'>if you build a chip, so we built this chip called</span>
  <span m='2517000'>RAW in our group, and it has on the order of 10</span> <span
  m='2521000'>million gates. And this chip we built with</span> <span
  m='2526000'>IBM's technology, and it turns out that you don't</span> <span
  m='2529000'>send power supply in through a pin and then connect that
  1.5V</span> <span m='2534000'>supply to all your gates. What you do is from
  that pin,</span> <span m='2538000'>you then build special power supply
  buffering trees.</span> </p><p><span m='2542000'>And each tree, each leaf of
  the tree drives a</span> <span m='2545000'>subcircuit. In other words,</span>
  <span m='2547000'>if this is a chip, you have lots and lots of gates</span>
  <span m='2551000'>throughout your chip. What you do not do is bring in</span>
  <span m='2556000'>a power supply like this, and then connect.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2560000'>You don't do that. That's the worst possible
  thing</span> <span m='2565000'>you can do. It's an absolute disaster
  for</span> <span m='2569000'>the reason just brought up. OK, so instead what
  you do is</span> <span m='2575000'>divide up the chip into, say, four
  quadrants.</span> </p><p><span m='2579000'>OK, in our case, we have 16
  quadrants.</span> </p><p><span m='2584000'>And then what you do is from this
  point, you take one wire</span> <span m='2588000'>that goes to this quadrant,
  one wire that comes here,</span> <span m='2592000'>one here, and one here, so
  that you're getting the</span> <span m='2595000'>power supply very close to
  the source, and you have different</span> <span m='2600000'>connections going
  to each quadrant so that switching in</span> <span m='2604000'>this quadrant
  will not affect this guy because of the</span> <span m='2607000'>inductance of
  this lead here. OK, and if you hadn't taken</span> <span m='2613000'>6.002,
  you'd have been arguing with IBM, I don't want 16 wires.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2617000'>I want just one wire. OK, so there are other</span> <span
  m='2620000'>solutions, of course. There's a couple more solution.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2624000'>One is that what you can do is part of the problem
  here is that</span> <span m='2629000'>all my transitions are really, really
  sharp.</span> </p><p><span m='2632000'>OK, so di/dt is very, very
  large.</span> </p><p><span m='2634000'>So, there's a whole new technique in
  design of digital</span> <span m='2638000'>and analog circuits, which talks
  about,</span> <span m='2641000'>maybe I should call it waveform engineering,
  OK,</span> <span m='2645000'>or edge engineering. OK, it's also called
  edge</span> <span m='2649000'>smoothing. The idea is that rather than</span>
  <span m='2652000'>have very sharp edges in your circuit, you try to
  have</span> <span m='2656000'>smoother edges. And when you have
  smoother</span> <span m='2659000'>edges, OK, then your di/dt is now going to
  be less.</span> </p><p><span m='2662000'>It's not going to be very, very
  high.</span> </p><p><span m='2665000'>Rather, your delta I is spread out over
  a longer period of</span> <span m='2669000'>time. Of course, that means
  the</span> <span m='2671000'>circuits may have to run a little slower,</span>
  <span m='2674000'>but that can also solve the problem.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2678000'>And in fact, that same smoothing of the</span> <span
  m='2681000'>waveforms was also the solution you saw in the capacitive</span>
  <span m='2686000'>coupling we saw a month and a half ago.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2689000'>And let me show you the demo, and then close up.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2693000'>Not working? OK, that's OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2695000'>It doesn't matter. So if you remember the demo</span> <span
  m='2700000'>from the lecture about a month and a half ago in
  capacitors,</span> <span m='2705000'>I talked about a chip with two pins, and
  there was this</span> <span m='2710000'>capacitive coupling between the
  pins.</span> </p><p><span m='2714000'>And because of this, if this waveform is
  switching,</span> <span m='2718000'>then because of this coupling, you will
  end up getting,</span> <span m='2723000'>if this is the signal here, you will
  end up getting spikes</span> <span m='2729000'>on this pin because of the
  signaling of the other pin.</span> </p><p><span m='2733000'>And that's good
  old capacitive coupling.</span> </p><p><span m='2739000'>OK, and to eliminate
  this, what you can do is much like</span> <span m='2742000'>with the
  inductance system, if you, rather than having</span> <span m='2745000'>sharp
  transitions on this pin, if you have smooth transitions</span> <span
  m='2749000'>that look like this, then what you can do is you'll</span> <span
  m='2752000'>now spread delta V from here to here over a longer delta T.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2756000'>OK, delta T has become longer, and because of
  that,</span> <span m='2759000'>you end up getting much better behavior, and
  you don't end up</span> <span m='2763000'>getting these spikes. So
  therefore,</span> <span m='2766000'>if you want to build really, really fast
  circuits,</span> <span m='2770000'>you have to be really careful. You can
  build fast circuits,</span> <span m='2773000'>but watch out for them fast
  edges.</span> </p><p><span m='2775000'>OK, fast edges are nasty. They kill
  you.</span> </p><p><span m='2778000'>That's something to remember as you build
  the next generation of</span> <span m='2782000'>circuits. Well, thank you
  all.</span> </p><p><span m='2784000'>I had a blast, and I hope you guys had
  fun</span> <span m='2787000'>too. Thank you.</span> </p>
