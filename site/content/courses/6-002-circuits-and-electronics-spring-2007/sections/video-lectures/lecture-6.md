title: 'Lecture 6: Nonlinear Analysis'
transcript: >-
  <p><span m='0'>-- will try it again at the end of this lecture and you show
  you</span> <span m='4000'>that stuff hopefully next time. For today we are
  going to start</span> <span m='9000'>with nonlinear analysis. Before we do
  that I wanted to</span> <span m='13000'>do a little bit of review.</span>
  <span m='29000'>I wanted to give you the past three weeks in perspective
  and</span> <span m='34000'>show you how all of these things fit into the grand
  scheme of</span> <span m='39000'>things. We began by building a great</span>
  <span m='43000'>little playground, and within that playground we</span> <span
  m='47000'>said that by enforcing upon ourselves the lumped matter</span> <span
  m='52000'>discipline we created the lumped circuit abstraction.</span> <span
  m='58000'>So within that playfield we assumed that we had dq by dt and</span>
  <span m='63000'>d phi by dt to be 0 so that gave us as the lumped
  circuit</span> <span m='68000'>abstraction. And within that lumped
  circuit</span> <span m='71000'>abstraction, within this playground we looked
  at several</span> <span m='76000'>methods of analyzing circuits, including the
  KVL,</span> <span m='81000'>KCL method. We also learned the method</span>
  <span m='84000'>involving composing resistors, the voltage dividers and so
  on</span> <span m='89000'>and solving circuits intuitively.</span> <span
  m='94000'>And we also looked at the node method, which is kind of the</span>
  <span m='98000'>workhorse of the circuits industry.</span> <span m='101000'>So
  when in doubt apply the node method and it will get you where</span> <span
  m='106000'>you want to go. Now, we also said that this is</span> <span
  m='110000'>good, here is our playground. We said hey,</span> <span
  m='113000'>if we focus on those circuits that are linear we come to the</span>
  <span m='118000'>left part of our playground. And we said that for
  linear</span> <span m='124000'>circuits in this part of the playground we can
  further use a</span> <span m='128000'>couple of techniques, a few
  techniques,</span> <span m='132000'>superposition, Thevenin, Norton and so
  on.</span> <span m='135000'>So these techniques allow you to very quickly
  analyze</span> <span m='139000'>complicated circuits, especially when you're
  looking</span> <span m='143000'>to find a single current, or voltage or some
  parameter of</span> <span m='148000'>interest. Whenever you see,</span> <span
  m='151000'>if you see a circuit containing multiple voltage sources or
  two</span> <span m='156000'>or more voltage sources or current sources,</span>
  <span m='160000'>as a first step think superposition.</span> <span
  m='163000'>And so these are very powerful techniques that let you
  analyze</span> <span m='168000'>very complicated circuits very
  effectively.</span> <span m='172000'>After we did this we said, oh, let me
  draw another</span> <span m='176000'>playground here. This is another piece of
  our</span> <span m='181000'>playground. And if these are linear circuit</span>
  <span m='185000'>then this half of the playground is nonlinear
  circuits.</span> <span m='190000'>And we said that if you further focus on
  discretized values,</span> <span m='196000'>if you discretized values and
  focused only on circuits that</span> <span m='201000'>dealt with binary
  signals, highs and lows,</span> <span m='205000'>then we came into this small
  regime of the playground.</span> <span m='212000'>And notice that digital
  circuits are,</span> <span m='216000'>by their very nature, nonlinear.</span>
  <span m='220000'>Remember the circuit, A, B, this was one of our NOR</span>
  <span m='226000'>gate circuits? And if you look at transfer</span> <span
  m='231000'>functions, that is if I plot, let's say for example,</span> <span
  m='238000'>for some combination of input values.</span> <span m='244000'>Let's
  say I plot v in verses v out.</span> <span m='246000'>Let's say, for example,
  I turned this guy off by</span> <span m='250000'>setting B to 0 and then I
  simply apply a low to high transition</span> <span m='255000'>at v in, then
  what I would see at the output is a transfer</span> <span m='259000'>function
  of the following sort where as v in changes the output</span> <span
  m='264000'>switches at some point and then stays at a low value.</span> <span
  m='269000'>So when v in is low v out is high and v in and high v out is</span>
  <span m='273000'>low. So that's kind of the v out</span> <span
  m='276000'>versus v in when B is set at 0. So notice that this is a</span>
  <span m='281000'>nonlinear curve. This is not a straight line.</span> <span
  m='284000'>It's a nonlinear curve. And so therefore in the digital</span>
  <span m='289000'>domain we see highly nonlinear functions that look like
  this</span> <span m='294000'>and so on. However, take a look at this</span>
  <span m='297000'>circuit. Suppose I focus on the circuit</span> <span
  m='301000'>for a given set of switch settings.</span> <span m='304000'>Let's
  say, for example, I focus on the circuit when A</span> <span m='308000'>and B
  are both 1s. For a given set of switch</span> <span m='312000'>settings,
  notice that I'm going to be either in this region or</span> <span
  m='317000'>in this region. Notice that this region is a</span> <span
  m='321000'>straight line. So if I focus on let's say both</span> <span
  m='324000'>A and B at once then I get something like this.</span> <span
  m='335000'>And in this situation, for a given set of switch</span> <span
  m='339000'>settings, notice that my digital circuit now can be analyzed</span>
  <span m='345000'>using linear techniques. So therefore my digital gets</span>
  <span m='350000'>moved into the linear domain for a given set of switch
  settings.</span> <span m='362000'>So if I fix my switch settings and look at
  the circuit then</span> <span m='366000'>each circuit, for a given set of
  switch</span> <span m='368000'>settings, is comprised of voltage sources and
  some</span> <span m='372000'>resistors and it's a linear circuit.</span> <span
  m='374000'>Again, I can go back and apply all my linear techniques to</span>
  <span m='379000'>virtually all the digital circuits that you will be</span>
  <span m='382000'>dealing with in 6.002. Again, remember if I fix my</span>
  <span m='386000'>switch settings, if I fix the inputs then the</span> <span
  m='389000'>output can be determined using linear techniques.</span> <span
  m='394000'>Because the digital circuits we're showing you in 6.002</span>
  <span m='397000'>simply comprise linear elements like voltage sources
  and</span> <span m='401000'>resistors and so on. You'll see some more
  later.</span> <span m='404000'>But you can apply your linear techniques and
  analyze them.</span> <span m='408000'>The cool thing here is that with just
  two weeks of stuff</span> <span m='411000'>that you've learned in 6.002, you
  are well on our way to</span> <span m='415000'>being able to analyze certain
  classes of digital circuits for</span> <span m='419000'>a given set of switch
  settings and many, many,</span> <span m='422000'>many linear circuits. What we
  will do today is focus</span> <span m='428000'>on nonlinear circuits. So we
  look at this space.</span> <span m='433000'>Notice again that up until now
  we've dealt with these three</span> <span m='439000'>methods, which apply to
  all circuits within this playground,</span> <span m='445000'>the lumped
  circuit playground. And the subset of that is the</span> <span
  m='451000'>linear domain. And we can analyze linear</span> <span
  m='454000'>circuits in this way. And digital circuits,</span> <span
  m='457000'>for a given set of switch settings, also fall within this</span>
  <span m='462000'>category. So notice that you can go ahead</span> <span
  m='465000'>and analyze the digital circuits using superposition or
  other</span> <span m='470000'>techniques like that. The next big step for us
  is to</span> <span m='474000'>begin our analysis of nonlinear circuits
  today.</span> <span m='479000'>The important thing to remember is that
  nonlinear circuits are</span> <span m='483000'>also within this big playground
  in which we are going under the</span> <span m='487000'>lumped matter
  discipline. So nonlinear circuits are also</span> <span m='491000'>lumped
  circuits. And therefore because we are in</span> <span m='495000'>that
  playground we can use any one of our techniques,</span> <span m='499000'>KVL,
  KCL or the node method to analyze nonlinear circuits.</span> <span
  m='503000'>So if you see a nonlinear circuit, don't get daunted.</span> <span
  m='508000'>Just remember this is meant to be simple stuff.</span> <span
  m='511000'>So let me simply write down the node equation and analyze
  it.</span> <span m='517000'>There is really nothing new in today's
  lecture.</span> <span m='521000'>I'm just going to show you a nonlinear
  circuit and analyzing</span> <span m='526000'>using techniques that you
  already know.</span> <span m='529000'>Today nonlinear circuits. And we look at
  several methods</span> <span m='534000'>of analyzing nonlinear circuits. We
  look at the "Analytic</span> <span m='541000'>Method". We look at a
  "Graphical</span> <span m='545000'>Method". You will look at a
  "Piecewise</span> <span m='551000'>Linear Method" in the book.</span> <span
  m='567000'>I won't be covering this in lecture.</span> <span m='569000'>You
  can read Section 4.4 for the piecewise linear method.</span> <span
  m='573000'>In this method you take your curves and you approximate them</span>
  <span m='578000'>with a bunch of straight line segments, kind of like the
  v</span> <span m='584000'>out, v in curve I've shown you there, and analyze
  the circuit</span> <span m='589000'>using linear techniques within any given
  straight line segment.</span> <span m='595000'>We will also do incremental
  analysis.</span> <span m='599000'>This is also called small signal
  analysis.</span> <span m='604000'>So I will cover these two today, I will
  introduce this one</span> <span m='608000'>today, and wrap that up during the
  next lecture.</span> <span m='625000'>Let's start with a simple
  example.</span> <span m='636000'>So I have some voltage, V, some voltage
  source V.</span> <span m='640000'>And I have some resistor, R.</span> <span
  m='643000'>And I have a fictitious device here that I labeled D.</span> <span
  m='649000'>Let's call this fictitious device the "Expo Dweeb".</span> <span
  m='654000'>I purposely chose a funky name because this is a fictitious</span>
  <span m='660000'>device. Let's call it the Expo Dweeb.</span> <span
  m='664000'>And let me write down the associated variables for this</span>
  <span m='669000'>device as follows. iD is the current flowing into</span>
  <span m='673000'>this terminal and vD is the voltage across this
  device.</span> <span m='677000'>So this is a nonlinear device.</span> <span
  m='689000'>And this device is characterized by the following</span> <span
  m='693000'>equation. Much like resistors were</span> <span
  m='695000'>characterized by an iV relation, V is equal to iR,</span> <span
  m='700000'>or i is equal to V/R. This device is also</span> <span
  m='703000'>characterized by the following element relationship.</span> <span
  m='707000'>It's a e raised to bvD. So there is an exponentiation</span> <span
  m='712000'>here. Again, this is a fictitious</span> <span m='715000'>device.
  And I'll show some funky things</span> <span m='718000'>that it does in a
  second. It's a very simple relation.</span> <span m='725000'>It's an
  exponential relation where the current relates to the</span> <span
  m='733000'>exponentiated value of the voltage vD across the element.</span>
  <span m='741000'>So I can plot iD versus vD for this element as
  follows.</span> <span m='749000'>Notice that when vD is 0 iD is a, so I have a
  here,</span> <span m='754000'>and it looks like this. It's a funny
  device,</span> <span m='759000'>a fictitious device. So when vD is 0,</span>
  <span m='762000'>I have some current flowing the device, and as vD increases
  I</span> <span m='769000'>get an exponential increase in the current through
  that device.</span> <span m='777000'>This device is funny in the sense that it
  is not a passive</span> <span m='780000'>device in that notice that when vD
  and iD are positive the</span> <span m='784000'>product is positive, which is
  fine,</span> <span m='786000'>which says that it is consuming power.</span>
  <span m='788000'>On the other hand, on the left-hand side notice</span> <span
  m='791000'>that the vI relation is negative, which means that when</span>
  <span m='795000'>I put a negative voltage on it, it can still sustain a
  positive</span> <span m='799000'>current. This must imply that the
  device</span> <span m='801000'>is producing power. But for the purpose of
  a</span> <span m='804000'>nonlinear analysis we don't have to worry about
  that.</span> <span m='809000'>Let's just do it mathematically and find out
  what it looks like.</span> <span m='813000'>So back to this again. I have a
  voltage source,</span> <span m='816000'>a resistor and my Expo Dweeb connected
  in that manner.</span> <span m='820000'>Now, again, reflect on this
  pattern.</span> <span m='823000'>A voltage source or a current source, a
  resistor and some</span> <span m='827000'>device. This is a very standard
  pattern</span> <span m='830000'>you will see again and again and again.</span>
  <span m='832000'>In particular, if you look at this device,</span> <span
  m='835000'>it's a nonlinear device here. And facing the nonlinear
  device</span> <span m='841000'>is a voltage source in series with a
  resistor.</span> <span m='845000'>And the reason I say that this is an
  incredibly important</span> <span m='849000'>pairing is the following. Notice
  that if on the left-hand</span> <span m='854000'>side I had any linear circuit
  and I had a single nonlinear</span> <span m='859000'>element in that circuit.
  Notice that by a Thevenin</span> <span m='863000'>reduction that you've
  learned you can take this entire mess.</span> <span m='869000'>If all you care
  about is the behavior of the nonlinear</span> <span m='872000'>device, for the
  purpose of analyzing this nonlinear device,</span> <span m='876000'>you can
  take this entire linear circuit, no matter how</span> <span
  m='879000'>complicated it is, voltage sources,</span> <span m='881000'>current
  sources, resistors and a bunch of other</span> <span m='884000'>funky stuff,
  you can boil all of that down to a Thevenin</span> <span
  m='887000'>equivalent, a voltage and a resistor in series.</span> <span
  m='890000'>So we can trick you. We can give you a complicated</span> <span
  m='894000'>circuit and say ah-ha, tell me what the current is</span> <span
  m='897000'>through this device if I apply some voltage,</span> <span
  m='899000'>3 volts there. What you can do is you can say</span> <span
  m='903000'>ah-ha, I don't care what happens here so I'm just going to</span>
  <span m='907000'>replace the whole thing with a Thevenin equivalent.</span>
  <span m='909000'>And you've done your homework now and you can
  calculate</span> <span m='913000'>Thevenin equivalents for circuits.</span>
  <span m='915000'>And simply replace this and then go ahead and solve
  the</span> <span m='918000'>circuit. Again, remember we are</span> <span
  m='919000'>engineers. We are looking for answers.</span> <span m='922000'>We
  are looking to build interesting systems.</span> <span m='924000'>And, in
  general, we like to take the simplest</span> <span m='927000'>path possible to
  the solution. So simplify your lives and</span> <span m='931000'>create a
  simple Thevenin coupled to a nonlinear device and then</span> <span
  m='935000'>you will be rolling. When we talk about a variety of</span> <span
  m='939000'>other circuits, nonlinear circuits,</span> <span
  m='941000'>time-varying circuits and so on in the rest of this course,</span>
  <span m='945000'>we will look at this pattern again and again and again
  and</span> <span m='948000'>again until we are blue in the face.</span> <span
  m='952000'>And, just remember, the reason we keep looking at</span> <span
  m='956000'>this pattern is that whenever you have some big linear mess</span>
  <span m='961000'>connected to some interesting device what you can do is if
  all</span> <span m='966000'>you care about is analyzing the behavior of that
  device,</span> <span m='971000'>you can take this linear mess and simply
  figure out the</span> <span m='976000'>Thevenin equivalent, or the Norton
  equivalent if you</span> <span m='981000'>like and replace this whole thing
  with its equivalent and</span> <span m='986000'>then go ahead and analyze it.
  So boil an arbitrarily circuit</span> <span m='992000'>down to a very simple
  pattern of this sort.</span> <span m='995000'>What this means is because of
  this brilliant Thevenin</span> <span m='998000'>simplification, going forward
  through the rest</span> <span m='1001000'>of this course we will mostly deal
  with very simple circuits</span> <span m='1005000'>like this, voltage source,
  resistor and the device.</span> <span m='1009000'>That's it. Very, very, very
  rarely will</span> <span m='1012000'>you see multiple sources and lots of
  resistors in a circuit.</span> <span m='1016000'>It's usually going to be
  simple stuff.</span> <span m='1020000'>And remember how we got here, by making
  a Thevenin</span> <span m='1023000'>simplification of a linear mess. All
  right.</span> <span m='1027000'>If in homeworks or quizzes or in real
  life,</span> <span m='1030000'>or in many examples of real life, if you find
  that you have</span> <span m='1035000'>to deal with a lot of grunge and a lot
  of mess,</span> <span m='1039000'>step back and think a little bit.</span>
  <span m='1041000'>Try to use intuition and see if you can simplify things
  using</span> <span m='1046000'>some clever trick or method. Method 1 of
  analysis.</span> <span m='1052000'>Let's go ahead and analyze this pattern
  here,</span> <span m='1056000'>this template circuit, if you will,</span>
  <span m='1060000'>a voltage source a resistor and a nonlinear device.</span>
  <span m='1066000'>This is the analytical method. And remember the node
  method</span> <span m='1072000'>applies, so let me go ahead and apply the node
  method.</span> <span m='1079000'>To apply the node method, what do I
  do?</span> <span m='1081000'>I first have to select a ground node.</span>
  <span m='1083000'>Let me insulate this as my ground node.</span> <span
  m='1086000'>Let me label all the nodes with their voltages.</span> <span
  m='1089000'>So this node has voltage V and this node has label the
  capital</span> <span m='1093000'>D. So let me go ahead and analyze</span>
  <span m='1095000'>this using the node method. So the node method says
  for</span> <span m='1099000'>each of the nodes in the circuit whose voltage is
  not known go</span> <span m='1103000'>ahead and write down KCL implicitly
  applying the element</span> <span m='1107000'>relationships to replace the
  current values with the voltage</span> <span m='1111000'>values. Let's start
  with the current</span> <span m='1115000'>going in that direction. Current
  going from the vD node</span> <span m='1120000'>through resistor R, which
  looks as follows,</span> <span m='1124000'>vD - V divided by R. That's a
  current going that</span> <span m='1128000'>way. And the current going down
  is</span> <span m='1131000'>iD. In general, when I apply the</span> <span
  m='1134000'>node method, I don't write iD here but I go ahead and write</span>
  <span m='1139000'>the element relation ae to the bvD here.</span> <span
  m='1144000'>Then I get an equation in vD and I just solve the mode</span>
  <span m='1148000'>voltage. However, just to make a couple</span> <span
  m='1152000'>of extra points later, let me go ahead and do that in</span> <span
  m='1156000'>two steps, write down this and then go ahead and write down
  iD</span> <span m='1162000'>separately as ae to the bvD. Again,
  remember,</span> <span m='1165000'>don't get confused here. In a node
  method,</span> <span m='1170000'>I don't write down a second step.</span>
  <span m='1172000'>I directly write down ae to bvD in place of iD.</span> <span
  m='1175000'>I get one equation in vD, I go solve it.</span> <span
  m='1178000'>Just for fun today, I'm taking two steps here,</span> <span
  m='1181000'>writing iD and explicitly putting down iD as ae to the</span>
  <span m='1185000'>bvD. Now, that's it.</span> <span m='1186000'>I mean this is
  all there is to it.</span> <span m='1188000'>You guys can now go ahead and
  analyze nonlinear circuits.</span> <span m='1192000'>You get a bunch of
  equations, a bunch of unknowns,</span> <span m='1196000'>go solve. I have two
  equations here.</span> <span m='1200000'>vD and iD are my unknowns and I can
  just go ahead and solve for</span> <span m='1204000'>them. Now, in general
  with nonlinear</span> <span m='1206000'>circuits, often times it's hard to get
  a closed form solution so</span> <span m='1210000'>you may have to use a bunch
  of methods.</span> <span m='1212000'>You can try a closed form solution or you
  can try</span> <span m='1216000'>numerical solutions or you can do trial and
  error.</span> <span m='1219000'>In this case, I'll just go ahead and
  tell</span> <span m='1221000'>you. Suppose I choose V as 1 volt,</span> <span
  m='1227000'>R is 1 ohm and b is 1 over volt and a is º amps for those</span>
  <span m='1236000'>values, approximately vD is roughly 0.5 volts and iD
  is</span> <span m='1245000'>roughly 0.4 volts. You can do this by using
  trial</span> <span m='1253000'>and error or other methods. In 6.002 we don't
  dwell on</span> <span m='1260000'>working too hard to solve equations of this
  sort.</span> <span m='1263000'>If you cannot substitute this in here and solve
  it directly,</span> <span m='1266000'>we don't ask you to go and learn
  numerical method and the</span> <span m='1270000'>techniques and so on to
  solve it.</span> <span m='1272000'>But just remember that you can use trial
  and error or you can</span> <span m='1275000'>use back substitution and other
  techniques that you will learn</span> <span m='1279000'>in future numerical
  methods classes and apply it here.</span> <span m='1282000'>But suffice it to
  say that, for here we can stick with</span> <span m='1285000'>trial and error
  if you like. And for these values,</span> <span m='1290000'>vD and iD are 0.5
  and approximately 0.4.</span> <span m='1293000'>You're done. It's really that
  simple.</span> <span m='1297000'>Yes. Oh, I'm sorry.</span> <span
  m='1299000'>Good catch. I know there is one person</span> <span
  m='1302000'>that's not sleeping here. Good.</span> <span m='1305000'>So, as I
  said, there's not a whole lot to it.</span> <span m='1309000'>Whether it's a
  nonlinear circuit or a linear circuit and</span> <span m='1315000'>as long as
  I am inside this playground here where the lumped</span> <span
  m='1320000'>circuit abstraction holds, I can apply my node equations</span>
  <span m='1326000'>and then go ahead and solve it.</span> <span m='1337000'>Let
  me show you a few more methods so we can articulate</span> <span
  m='1343000'>your repertoire of tools for nonlinear circuits.</span> <span
  m='1350000'>And I'd like to show you a graphical technique.</span> <span
  m='1353000'>I personally rarely use a graphical technique to solve</span>
  <span m='1357000'>circuits. And why am I sharing this with</span> <span
  m='1360000'>you? It turns out that often times</span> <span m='1362000'>by
  looking at things graphically you can get some better insights</span> <span
  m='1367000'>into circuit behavior. You can also show cool demos</span> <span
  m='1371000'>when you show graphs of responses kind of playing with</span>
  <span m='1375000'>each other and so on. So this is fun for getting</span>
  <span m='1380000'>intuition and things like that. Graphically all I'm
  really</span> <span m='1386000'>going to do is solve those two equations
  graphically.</span> <span m='1391000'>So I'm going to plot equation
  one.</span> <span m='1395000'>Let me rewrite equation one as follows.</span>
  <span m='1399000'>iD is --</span> <span m='1406000'>I'm just rewriting
  equation one as follows.</span> <span m='1410000'>V/R - vD/R. And I can also
  draw the second</span> <span m='1420000'>guy --</span> <span m='1431000'>OK, I
  can do this as well. I can do an iD versus vD plot.</span> <span
  m='1444000'>And in this particular situation, you've seen this</span> <span
  m='1449000'>already, that's my iD versus vD curve right there.</span> <span
  m='1454000'>And I can do the same for this one here.</span> <span
  m='1459000'>So this equation establishes the following straight line</span>
  <span m='1465000'>relationship. It says that when vD is 0,</span> <span
  m='1469000'>iD is V/R. So that's here.</span> <span m='1473000'>And similarly
  when iD is 0 then vD is equal to V so I get</span> <span m='1478000'>something
  here. So that's my straight line</span> <span m='1481000'>relationship
  corresponding to this equation here.</span> <span m='1486000'>So what I can do
  is I can simply solve these by</span> <span m='1490000'>superimposing the two
  curves on the same vD, iD template here</span> <span m='1495000'>and finding
  the intersection of the curves.</span> <span m='1500000'>So I can take this
  curve corresponding to two and I can</span> <span m='1506000'>take this curve
  corresponding to one, and this is V/R and this is</span> <span m='1514000'>V,
  0, and I can find the intersection point.</span> <span m='1519000'>This curve
  here, for reasons that will be</span> <span m='1524000'>obvious about three
  weeks from now, is called the load line.</span> <span m='1533000'>It's called
  the load line. You will understand why that is</span> <span m='1537000'>so in
  a later lecture. So I've given you a template on</span> <span m='1542000'>Page
  6 to boil these two down into one equation.</span> <span m='1546000'>So there,
  again, you can substitute the values</span> <span m='1549000'>for V is 1 volt
  and R is 1 and so on and so forth and get the</span> <span m='1554000'>same
  kind of result as you did previously.</span> <span m='1565000'>So there is
  really nothing new here.</span> <span m='1567000'>All I've done in the second
  method is combined the two</span> <span m='1570000'>equations graphically and
  found the solution by looking at where</span> <span m='1574000'>the two curves
  intersect.</span> <span m='1586000'>At the start of the lecture I also told
  you that you may want</span> <span m='1590000'>to go and check out the
  piecewise linear technique --</span> <span m='1602000'>-- in Section 4.4 of
  the course notes.</span> <span m='1613000'>All right. For today let me do a
  third</span> <span m='1618000'>method called "Incremental Analysis".</span>
  <span m='1633000'>This technique is also called the small signal
  method.</span> <span m='1650000'>I'm going to show you, before I go into the
  method,</span> <span m='1653000'>in today's lecture what I'll do is I'll give
  you a motivating</span> <span m='1658000'>example for why we need the small
  signal approach.</span> <span m='1662000'>I'll give you a motivating example
  and show you a little</span> <span m='1667000'>demo. And then I will close
  with</span> <span m='1669000'>showing you a problem with applying a standard
  approach,</span> <span m='1673000'>and I'll ask you to see if you can figure
  out a way to handle</span> <span m='1678000'>it in time for next lecture. So
  let me give you the</span> <span m='1683000'>motivation here.</span> <span
  m='1690000'>So here is what I want to do. Many of you have seen one of</span>
  <span m='1694000'>those electric eye garage door openers, right?</span> <span
  m='1697000'>You have a receiver at one end and you have some kind of a</span>
  <span m='1702000'>light beam at the other, and when you walk through it</span>
  <span m='1706000'>stops, or rather it cuts the circuit and stops the door
  from</span> <span m='1710000'>closing. And when no one is going</span> <span
  m='1713000'>through it maintains a connection and lets the door</span> <span
  m='1717000'>close. So what we did is we went to</span> <span m='1720000'>Home
  Depot, or one of those stores, and bought a very</span> <span
  m='1724000'>standard device that essentially produces some response
  when</span> <span m='1729000'>light impinges on it. And my goal will be to see
  if I</span> <span m='1733000'>can send music over the light beam using a
  simple garage door</span> <span m='1737000'>opener device. So here is the
  little circuit</span> <span m='1741000'>that I will do. We actually went there
  and</span> <span m='1743000'>built this. I will also show you a demo.</span>
  <span m='1751000'>Here is my time-varying voltage, vI(t),</span> <span
  m='1755000'>and this is some music signal.</span> <span m='1768000'>And get
  some music signal. And I want to connect this to</span> <span m='1772000'>this
  device, which is a device found in garage door openers.</span> <span
  m='1778000'>I am going to call it a LED. If you like,</span> <span
  m='1783000'>you can view it as, this is very similar to our</span> <span
  m='1787000'>Expo Dweeb. This is called a "Light</span> <span
  m='1791000'>Emitting Expo Dweeb". That's why it is LED.</span> <span
  m='1795000'>So what the LED does is, as I apply this voltage across</span>
  <span m='1800000'>it, that same voltage appears across the Light Emitting
  Expo</span> <span m='1806000'>Dweeb. And there is some current that</span>
  <span m='1811000'>flows through the device. And for our analysis we
  will</span> <span m='1815000'>assume that this device virtually has an
  identical iD</span> <span m='1819000'>characteristic to the Expo Dweeb just
  that it emits light.</span> <span m='1824000'>So when I pass a current through
  it, it emits light.</span> <span m='1829000'>And the light intensity is
  proportional to the current that</span> <span m='1834000'>flows through. So it
  emits light and light</span> <span m='1838000'>intensity, LD, is proportional
  to iD.</span> <span m='1847000'>Here is my little light emitting
  device,</span> <span m='1849000'>which when current flows through it,
  itproduces light</span> <span m='1852000'>because its intensity is
  proportional to the current.</span> <span m='1856000'>And what I will do is I
  will stick in the receiver here.</span> <span m='1860000'>Think of it as a
  photo resistor or some other device where I am</span> <span m='1865000'>going
  to connect that in a circuit.</span> <span m='1868000'>I am not going to spend
  too much time on this side.</span> <span m='1873000'>I'm going to focus on the
  left-hand side here.</span> <span m='1877000'>And let's say I have some kind
  of amplifier and speakers and so</span> <span m='1882000'>on and so forth.
  Suffice it to say that when the</span> <span m='1887000'>light falls on this
  device PR that iR that goes through here</span> <span m='1893000'>is
  proportional to the received light intensity.</span> <span m='1897000'>So if
  the current is proportional to the received</span> <span m='1901000'>light
  intensity then I amplify that signal in my amplifier and</span> <span
  m='1907000'>I get the music playing out here.</span> <span m='1910000'>And
  notice that the following chain of dependences apply.</span> <span
  m='1915000'>So I have an input music signal VI.</span> <span m='1920000'>That
  gets converted to some iD. These are all time-varying</span> <span
  m='1926000'>signals, so VI is a time-varying signal and so is iD.</span> <span
  m='1933000'>And iD gets converted to light of some intensity LD.</span> <span
  m='1939000'>This in turn gets attenuated somewhat and is received at
  the</span> <span m='1946000'>photo resistor. And I get some intensity
  LR</span> <span m='1951000'>impinging on that device there. And that in turn
  produces a</span> <span m='1956000'>current iR and then iR is amplified and
  goes through a</span> <span m='1960000'>speaker and so on and produces
  sound.</span> <span m='1963000'>Notice that using this chain I've taken a
  music signal here</span> <span m='1968000'>and I am playing it here. And just
  imagine that this is</span> <span m='1973000'>your garage door opener device
  here where the light emitted is</span> <span m='1978000'>being articulated by
  the voltage signal VI.</span> <span m='1983000'>And received here. So notice
  that if I cut this,</span> <span m='1986000'>if I stick something in here and
  block it then I get no</span> <span m='1989000'>response here, but if I take
  my hand away then</span> <span m='1992000'>I do get some response. But this is
  fine.</span> <span m='1995000'>This should work. You could try this at home
  if</span> <span m='1998000'>you'd like. If you have a garage door</span> <span
  m='2000000'>opener, just stick a little circuit like this and it should</span>
  <span m='2004000'>simply work. We have a problem,</span> <span
  m='2006000'>though. The problem is that,</span> <span m='2010000'>as I said,
  I'm using the Expo Dweeb here, the light emitting</span> <span
  m='2016000'>Expo Dweeb, and its characteristics are as follows.</span> <span
  m='2021000'>iD is exponentially related to the voltage vD,</span> <span
  m='2026000'>so this is nonlinear.</span> <span m='2037000'>And that's a real
  problem. Because this is nonlinear,</span> <span m='2042000'>I am going to get
  a distorted output.</span> <span m='2045000'>Let me show you a little wave
  form, a little graph to show you</span> <span m='2050000'>how the distortion
  happens and then show you a little demo</span> <span m='2054000'>showing you
  the distortion. Let me graphically show you the</span> <span m='2059000'>kind
  of distortion that is happening here,</span> <span m='2063000'>and I will do
  it by drawing the following graph.</span> <span m='2076000'>So this is the vD,
  iD curve for our device.</span> <span m='2080000'>And what I'm going to plot
  for you is if I have a time-varying</span> <span m='2086000'>vD voltage, I
  just want to see what the time-varying iD current</span> <span
  m='2092000'>looks like. And a trick to plot that is to</span> <span
  m='2096000'>take your input voltage like so. And let's say I apply a</span>
  <span m='2102000'>sinusoid. So I am just taking a</span> <span
  m='2104000'>time-varying sinusoidal voltage and rotating the plot 90
  degrees</span> <span m='2110000'>like so, so I can see where these points
  correspond to on</span> <span m='2115000'>that curve. So what this says is
  that at</span> <span m='2119000'>some point here, for example,</span> <span
  m='2121000'>where vI, at this point and time, vI is here.</span> <span
  m='2125000'>Notice vI and vD are the same thing because vI is applied</span>
  <span m='2130000'>across vD. vI directly applies across the</span> <span
  m='2135000'>device, and so vI equals vD at all time.</span> <span
  m='2139000'>So this voltage here corresponds to this voltage,</span> <span
  m='2143000'>it corresponds to this current and then I can find out what
  the</span> <span m='2149000'>current is for that voltage. By using the same
  artifice I</span> <span m='2154000'>can plot the output current iD like
  so.</span> <span m='2159000'>So for this value I get some current here.</span>
  <span m='2162000'>And so at time T0 I start here. And notice that as this
  signal</span> <span m='2167000'>moves up here, I can find out the</span> <span
  m='2169000'>corresponding values of iD by looking at where a straight
  line</span> <span m='2174000'>intersects here and plotting the values
  here.</span> <span m='2178000'>I have a nice little graphical animation to
  show you this.</span> <span m='2182000'>Hopefully, the laptop will work
  tomorrow and we can check that.</span> <span m='2189000'>I am doing nothing
  new here. Just showing you a trick to be</span> <span m='2193000'>able to plot
  vI versus v out relationships,</span> <span m='2197000'>or vI or versus other
  relationships based on some kind</span> <span m='2201000'>of a transfer
  function. So what you end up getting is</span> <span m='2206000'>something
  that looks like this. Why is that?</span> <span m='2209000'>Notice that this
  curve here corresponds to the signal.</span> <span m='2214000'>As this signal
  moves from here to here, this point moves from</span> <span m='2219000'>here
  to here and that corresponds to this iD.</span> <span m='2224000'>When this
  moves from here to here that corresponds to a point</span> <span
  m='2228000'>moving from this part of the curve to here,</span> <span
  m='2231000'>and that looks like so. And then for the whole negative</span>
  <span m='2236000'>incursion, notice that the whole negative incursion moves
  here,</span> <span m='2240000'>so for that entire negative incursion I get an
  output that</span> <span m='2245000'>looks like this. Notice that this device
  has</span> <span m='2248000'>completely cut off and hammered negative going
  signals.</span> <span m='2254000'>What it's done is that rather than giving me
  a nice little</span> <span m='2257000'>negative spike incursion here, or
  excursion here,</span> <span m='2261000'>what this is doing is that it is
  taking this excursion and</span> <span m='2265000'>simply slamming it down to
  this value here.</span> <span m='2267000'>And then again, when I go back
  up,</span> <span m='2270000'>I get this peak here. So notice that what was a
  nice</span> <span m='2273000'>little sinusoid out there gets hammered and
  squished into this</span> <span m='2277000'>funny curve here. What this device
  is doing is</span> <span m='2281000'>for positive values it tends to produce
  exponentially greater</span> <span m='2286000'>current so I get boom,
  high-rising peaks corresponding</span> <span m='2289000'>to these two, and for
  negative going voltages</span> <span m='2292000'>it simply compresses them to
  a low positive value here.</span> <span m='2296000'>And that's what I see here
  corresponding to negative</span> <span m='2299000'>excursion. So notice that
  what this will</span> <span m='2302000'>do, if I view sound, if I input sound
  here,</span> <span m='2305000'>and sound has negative going excursions it will
  simply</span> <span m='2308000'>scrunch them. But more or less let the</span>
  <span m='2312000'>positive things through. And that is going to give
  rise</span> <span m='2316000'>to a bunch of distortion in my signal.</span>
  <span m='2318000'>So I would like to show you a little demo.</span> <span
  m='2321000'>Actually, we've gone ahead and built a little device like
  this.</span> <span m='2325000'>We have an honest to goodness little device
  costing,</span> <span m='2328000'>I don't know, 50 cents or $1 or
  something,</span> <span m='2331000'>which is a little voltage, it's a device
  that emits light</span> <span m='2334000'>proportional to the current flowing
  through it.</span> <span m='2339000'>I have a receiver. And I am going to play
  some</span> <span m='2341000'>music, and you will listen to the output
  here.</span> <span m='2344000'>And hopefully you should see a bunch of
  distortion because of</span> <span m='2347000'>that effect that I showed
  you.</span> <span m='2356000'>And what I will do is, before we do that,</span>
  <span m='2359000'>you will see two curves up there.</span> <span
  m='2361000'>The yellow, I believe is the vI, is the input,</span> <span
  m='2365000'>and the green, I believe, is a signal</span> <span
  m='2367000'>proportionate to -- The other way around.</span> <span
  m='2371000'>Oh, I see. So green is the input.</span> <span m='2373000'>So
  green, the lower one is the input and the upper one is the</span> <span
  m='2377000'>distorted output. So we are going to play some</span> <span
  m='2380000'>sound through it, music through it and you can</span> <span
  m='2383000'>listen, through a little CD player.</span> <span m='2425000'>So a
  couple of things. The good news is that it works.</span> <span
  m='2430000'>However, I doubt that music artists will come to my studio</span>
  <span m='2433000'>to record if this is the quality of what I produce.</span>
  <span m='2437000'>Do notice that there are hardly any negative going
  excursions in</span> <span m='2441000'>that curve up there, right?</span>
  <span m='2443000'>All the negative ones have been like scrunched up down into
  a</span> <span m='2447000'>flat line there, and that's the reason I get</span>
  <span m='2450000'>this distortion. And just to prove to you that I</span>
  <span m='2454000'>am indeed using a garage door opener device and not faking
  it</span> <span m='2458000'>here, I am going to just shut the signal off by
  stopping the</span> <span m='2462000'>light using a piece of paper
  here.</span> <span m='2466000'>So notice that this device here is the little
  device that has a</span> <span m='2471000'>light beam going through the
  center, and I am going to take</span> <span m='2476000'>this piece of paper,
  can you turn it up?</span> <span m='2494000'>So let's have some fun with
  this.</span> <span m='2496000'>If I were to put this piece of paper halfway
  down,</span> <span m='2499000'>I should get half the intensity, right.</span>
  <span m='2502000'>So my sound should diminish in volume a little bit.</span>
  <span m='2506000'>Maybe that will work. Let's see if it works.</span> <span
  m='2509000'>Nothing to do with 002 but it's just fun.</span> <span
  m='2512000'>Louder. You can make it loud.</span> <span m='2532000'>Too much
  coffee. My hand is shaking.</span> <span m='2535000'>I guess you did see the
  lowering of volume,</span> <span m='2539000'>right?</span> <span
  m='2550000'>OK. Just way too much coffee,</span> <span m='2552000'>and so my
  hand was shaking too fast imposing its own sine wave</span> <span
  m='2558000'>on top of the signal. What did I show you?</span> <span
  m='2561000'>This was garbage, right?</span> <span m='2563000'>We had a nice
  little signal input, and the output was</span> <span m='2568000'>completely
  distorted because I was playing sound over this and</span> <span
  m='2574000'>this is what happened. Switch to Page 9.</span> <span
  m='2579000'>Now, this is what I would have liked to have happened.</span>
  <span m='2583000'>On Page 9 what I would have liked to see happen is
  this.</span> <span m='2596000'>Suppose I had a light emitting device that
  looked linear,</span> <span m='2602000'>a straight line where the current was
  linearly related to</span> <span m='2609000'>vD. Then what I would see,</span>
  <span m='2611000'>if I had a sinusoid here then I would get a sinusoid
  here.</span> <span m='2615000'>No distortion there, right?</span> <span
  m='2617000'>If only things were like I wanted them, if I had a linear</span>
  <span m='2621000'>device, but I don't have a linear device.</span> <span
  m='2624000'>I have an Expo Dweeb. Now you know why I call it a</span> <span
  m='2628000'>dweeb. Well, I'd like a linear device</span> <span m='2631000'>and
  it's exponential. But this is what I would like.</span> <span m='2642000'>And
  if I had this I wouldn't show it to you today.</span> <span m='2645000'>If I
  had this my music would go through without any distortion</span> <span
  m='2649000'>and I wouldn't have to run cables through my attic.</span> <span
  m='2652000'>I could just use my garage door opener to play signals from
  my</span> <span m='2656000'>bedroom and living room and so on, right?</span>
  <span m='2658000'>So the key thing here is how do I get this?</span> <span
  m='2661000'>And what I would like you to do is think about it
  yourselves.</span> <span m='2665000'>What I am given is something like
  this.</span> <span m='2669000'>This about it yourselves, you know, what would
  you do?</span> <span m='2672000'>See if you can come to me before lecture
  tomorrow or</span> <span m='2675000'>Thursday and tell me the answer,
  OK?</span> </p>
