transcript: >-
  <p><span m='0'>So, one question to ask ourselves is,</span> <span
  m='4000'>what is engineering? How do we define,</span> <span m='8000'>what is
  engineering? Well, the definition I like to</span> <span m='15000'>use is one
  put forth by Steve Senturia, one of our professors</span> <span m='22000'>who
  is now retired. He defined engineering to be</span> <span m='28000'>the
  purposeful use of science. All right, so what is 6.002</span> <span
  m='35000'>about? So, 6.002 is a first course in</span> <span
  m='38000'>engineering. And I like to view 6.002 as the</span> <span
  m='41000'>gainful employment of Maxwell's equations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='44000'>Many of you have seen Maxwell's equations before.</span>
  </p><p><span m='48000'>Most of you should have. And they are hard
  stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='52000'>6.002 is all about teaching you how to
  simplify our lives,</span> <span m='57000'>make things simple. So, if you can
  gainfully employ</span> <span m='62000'>Maxwell's equations, gainfully employ
  the facts of</span> <span m='67000'>nature to build very interesting
  systems.</span> </p><p><span m='71000'>So let me show you how the transition
  is made.</span> </p><p><span m='75000'>So, there's a world around us, nature,
  so we made some</span> <span m='80000'>observations in nature. We make
  measurements,</span> <span m='84000'>and we can write down large tables of
  measurements.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>So, for example, we can take
  objects and measure</span> <span m='93000'>the voltage across them, and look
  at the resulting</span> <span m='97000'>current through the elements. So, we
  may end up getting a</span> <span m='101000'>bunch of values such as
  [CHALKBOARD].</span> </p><p><span m='104000'>So, we start out life with making
  measurements on what</span> <span m='108000'>exists. And we build a bunch of
  tables.</span> </p><p><span m='111000'>Now, we could directly take these
  tables,</span> <span m='114000'>and based on observations of these
  tables,</span> <span m='117000'>we could go ahead and build very interesting
  engineering</span> <span m='121000'>systems that help us out in day-to-day
  lives.</span> </p><p><span m='126000'>But that's incredibly hard. Imagine
  having to resort to a</span> <span m='130000'>set of tables to do any kind of
  useful work.</span> </p><p><span m='134000'>So what we do as engineers, we
  first layer a level of</span> <span m='138000'>abstraction. We look at all the
  data,</span> <span m='141000'>and somehow layer abstraction such that we can
  simplify or</span> <span m='145000'>much more succinctly put in a simple
  equation or a simple</span> <span m='150000'>statement what these numbers are
  telling us.</span> </p><p><span m='155000'>OK, so for example, our physics
  laws,</span> <span m='157000'>so laws of physics for example are simply
  abstractions,</span> <span m='161000'>the laws of abstractions. So, these sets
  of numbers can</span> <span m='165000'>be codified by Ohm's law, for
  example,</span> <span m='168000'>V is equal to RI, the voltage current,</span>
  <span m='171000'>relates to the resistance of the object.</span> </p><p><span
  m='174000'>So, V is equal to RI is a law that succinctly describes a
  set</span> <span m='178000'>of experiments, and replaces a large number
  of</span> <span m='182000'>tables with a very simple statement.</span>
  </p><p><span m='186000'>You could call this the law, or you could call it
  an</span> <span m='189000'>abstraction. OK so you see laws of physics,</span>
  <span m='193000'>call them abstractions of physics if you like.</span>
  </p><p><span m='196000'>Similarly, there are Maxwell's equations and so on and
  so</span> <span m='201000'>forth. So, this is what is.</span> </p><p><span
  m='203000'>This is what's out there. OK, and a law as an abstraction</span>
  <span m='207000'>describe the properties of nature, as we see it,</span> <span
  m='211000'>in some succinct form. Now, if you want to go and</span> <span
  m='215000'>build useful things, we could take these</span> <span
  m='218000'>abstractions, take Maxwell's equations,</span> <span m='220000'>and
  go and build things. But it's hard.</span> </p><p><span m='223000'>It's
  really, really hard.</span> </p><p><span m='224000'>And what you learn in, at
  MIT is this place is all</span> <span m='228000'>about simplifying things.
  Take complicated things,</span> <span m='231000'>build layers of abstraction,
  and simplify things so that we</span> <span m='235000'>can build useful
  systems. Even in 6.002 we start life by</span> <span m='240000'>making a huge
  leap from Maxwell's equations to a couple</span> <span m='244000'>of very,
  very simple laws. OK, I'm going to show you that</span> <span m='249000'>leap
  that we will make today. So, the first abstraction that</span> <span
  m='254000'>we layer is called the lump circuit abstraction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='258000'>OK, in the lump circuit abstraction, what we do is
  we</span> <span m='262000'>make a set of simplifications that allows us to
  view a set of</span> <span m='267000'>objects as discrete or lumped
  elements.</span> </p><p><span m='272000'>So, we may, I will define voltage
  sources.</span> </p><p><span m='275000'>We'll define resistors. We'll define
  capacitors,</span> <span m='278000'>and so on. OK, and I'm going to make
  the</span> <span m='281000'>jump, and show you how we make the jump in a few
  minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='286000'>So, on that sort of abstraction, we
  then layer yet</span> <span m='289000'>another abstract layer. And let me call
  that the</span> <span m='293000'>amplifier abstraction. OK, remember,</span>
  <span m='296000'>here we are absolutely down and dirty.</span> </p><p><span
  m='300000'>We are setting the probes, measuring objects,</span> <span
  m='302000'>and building huge tables. We abstracted things into</span> <span
  m='305000'>simple laws, and life got a little better.</span> </p><p><span
  m='307000'>OK, I'm going to show you can abstract things further out
  and</span> <span m='311000'>build discrete objects, and, you could build even
  more</span> <span m='314000'>interesting components called amplifiers and
  begin playing</span> <span m='317000'>around with amplifiers. OK, so when you
  are using</span> <span m='320000'>amplifiers, you don't really have to worry
  about the details</span> <span m='323000'>of Maxwell's equations. OK, I'll
  give you some very</span> <span m='326000'>simple abstract rules of behavior
  for an amplifier,</span> <span m='329000'>and you can go build very
  interesting systems without</span> <span m='332000'>really, really knowing how
  Maxwell's equations applies to</span> <span m='335000'>that because you will
  be working at this abstract layer.</span> </p><p><span m='340000'>However,
  since you're engineers, and you are good at</span> <span m='343000'>building
  such systems, it's very important for you to</span> <span
  m='347000'>understand how we make this leap from the laws of physics
  into</span> <span m='351000'>some of our very primitive engineering
  abstractions.</span> </p><p><span m='354000'>So, once we make the amplified
  abstraction in 6.002,</span> <span m='358000'>by the way, 6.002 starts here.
  We start from the laws of</span> <span m='362000'>physics and then proceed all
  the way out.</span> </p><p><span m='366000'>So, once we talk about amplifiers
  we will take two</span> <span m='370000'>pads. On the amplifier,</span> <span
  m='372000'>you will build the next abstraction called the digital</span> <span
  m='378000'>abstraction. OK, and with the digital</span> <span
  m='381000'>abstraction, we will build new elements such as inverters
  and</span> <span m='387000'>combinational gates, OK?</span> </p><p><span
  m='391000'>So, notice we are building bigger, and bigger things,</span> <span
  m='395000'>which have more and more complicated behavior inside</span> <span
  m='398000'>them, but which are very simple to describe, right?</span>
  </p><p><span m='402000'>So, following the digital abstraction, we will
  superimpose</span> <span m='407000'>the combinational logic abstraction on top
  of that,</span> <span m='411000'>and define functional blocks that look like
  this:</span> <span m='414000'>some inputs, some function,</span> <span
  m='416000'>some outputs. The next abstraction on top of</span> <span
  m='421000'>that will be the clock digital abstraction, where we will
  have</span> <span m='426000'>some notion of time introduced into the
  system.</span> </p><p><span m='430000'>There will be a clock, and this will be
  some function.</span> </p><p><span m='434000'>And there will be a clock that
  introduces time into the sort of</span> <span m='439000'>logic values that
  functions operate upon.</span> </p><p><span m='443000'>Following that, the
  next level of abstraction</span> <span m='446000'>that we build is called
  instruction set abstraction.</span> </p><p><span m='452000'>OK, now you begin
  to see things that consumers get to look at.</span> </p><p><span
  m='457000'>Can someone give me an example of, or name an instruction
  set,</span> <span m='462000'>or instruction set abstraction? Bingo.</span>
  </p><p><span m='465000'>So, x86 is one set of abstractions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='468000'>And in fact, in many universities,</span> <span
  m='471000'>education could well start just by saying, OK,</span> <span
  m='475000'>here's an abstraction. These are the x86 instructions,</span> <span
  m='479000'>OK? Some MIT gurus have designed</span> <span m='482000'>this
  awesome little microprocessor,</span> <span m='485000'>OK? So you just worry
  about,</span> <span m='487000'>you take this abstraction layer here, the
  assembly instructions,</span> <span m='491000'>and you go and build systems on
  top of that.</span> </p><p><span m='494000'>OK, so this is an abstraction
  layer called the x86 layer.</span> </p><p><span m='498000'>There are other
  abstraction layers.</span> </p><p><span m='500000'>In 6.004, you will learn
  about, I believe, the alpha or the</span> <span m='504000'>beta, OK, and
  various other abstractions at this point.</span> </p><p><span m='509000'>So,
  6.002 kind of goes until here.</span> </p><p><span m='511000'>6.002 takes me
  from the world of physics all the way to the</span> <span m='516000'>world of
  interesting analog and digital systems.</span> </p><p><span m='520000'>OK,
  004, the course on computation structures,</span> <span m='524000'>will show
  you how to build computers all the way from</span> <span m='528000'>simple
  digital objects all the way to big systems.</span> </p><p><span
  m='533000'>Following that, you learn about language</span> <span
  m='536000'>abstractions, Java, C, and other languages,</span> <span
  m='539000'>and that's in 6.002. And there are several other</span> <span
  m='545000'>courses that will cover that. Following this,</span> <span
  m='548000'>you learn about software system abstractions,</span> <span
  m='552000'>and software systems, you will learn about operating</span> <span
  m='556000'>systems. Any example of an operating</span> <span m='558000'>system
  abstraction that people know out there?</span> </p><p><span m='562000'>What's
  that? Linux.</span> </p><p><span m='563000'>What else? I'm just wondering how
  long</span> <span m='566000'>I'll have to go before I hear what I want to
  hear.</span> </p><p><span m='572000'>[LAUGHTER] OK, so we have a bunch of
  software</span> <span m='575000'>systems. So, if we have a bunch of</span>
  <span m='577000'>software systems, these are nothing but</span> <span
  m='579000'>abstractions. Linux simply implies a set of</span> <span
  m='582000'>system calls that the programs must adhere to.</span> </p><p><span
  m='585000'>Windows is another set of system calls.</span> </p><p><span
  m='588000'>That's it. And see how much money they</span> <span m='590000'>made
  out of it? OK, it's all about abstraction</span> <span m='594000'>layers, that
  all start from nature.</span> </p><p><span m='596000'>All right? Build
  abstraction upon</span> <span m='598000'>abstraction upon abstraction upon
  abstraction,</span> <span m='601000'>and someone out here are lots of
  dollars.</span> </p><p><span m='606000'>OK, so based on these
  abstractions,</span> <span m='609000'>we can then build useful things for
  human beings.</span> </p><p><span m='614000'>We can build very useful things,
  video games,</span> <span m='618000'>so we can send space shuttles up, and a
  whole bunch of other</span> <span m='624000'>systems. But it's based on
  these</span> <span m='627000'>abstraction layers. What's unique about
  education</span> <span m='632000'>at MIT? What's unique about 6.002 and</span>
  <span m='634000'>EECS? Is to my knowledge,</span> <span m='636000'>there are
  not many other places in the world where you will get</span> <span
  m='641000'>an education in everything going all the way from nature to
  how</span> <span m='645000'>to build very complicated analog and digital
  systems.</span> </p><p><span m='649000'>OK, we will show you layer upon layer
  upon layer upon layer,</span> <span m='653000'>peel away the onion until you
  are down to raw nature,</span> <span m='657000'>OK, through Maxwell's
  equations.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>So, 6.002, 004, this is 033,</span>
  <span m='662000'>OK, 6.170, and so on. OK, the whole EECS is about</span>
  <span m='667000'>building abstraction layers, one on top of the other.</span>
  </p><p><span m='671000'>So that's one path. There's the analog path.</span>
  </p><p><span m='674000'>The analog path would take an amplifier, and build
  an</span> <span m='678000'>abstraction layer called the op-amp.</span>
  </p><p><span m='681000'>See how similar they all look? You know the
  amplifier,</span> <span m='685000'>the inverter of the digital world, and the
  operational</span> <span m='689000'>amplifier in the analog world, just
  different ways of looking</span> <span m='694000'>at the same devices. So, to
  build an analog system,</span> <span m='699000'>to build an operational
  amplifier, and then,</span> <span m='703000'>here we go end up building a
  whole bunch of different</span> <span m='708000'>interesting analog system
  components.</span> </p><p><span m='711000'>OK, and these components might look
  like oscillators.</span> </p><p><span m='716000'>They might look like filters.
  OK, they look like power</span> <span m='722000'>supplies, a whole bunch of
  very interesting abstract components,</span> <span m='728000'>which pulled
  together can then give you the next set of</span> <span m='733000'>systems.
  And these systems might be</span> <span m='737000'>toasters, or say for
  example other analog systems like the</span> <span m='742000'>various control
  systems for various power plants and so on</span> <span m='748000'>and so
  forth, and ultimately,</span> <span m='751000'>fun and dollars. OK, so 6.002
  is about going</span> <span m='756000'>from physics all the way to this
  point.</span> </p><p><span m='759000'>We will build interesting analog
  systems,</span> <span m='763000'>and take you up to interesting digital system
  components,</span> <span m='768000'>from which 004 will take you all the way
  to building computer</span> <span m='774000'>architectures. So that, in a
  nutshell,</span> <span m='777000'>kind of gives you a feel for the space of
  EECS.</span> </p><p><span m='783000'>OK, this chart here is almost a vignette
  of what EECS at MIT is</span> <span m='788000'>all about. And this is the
  world according</span> <span m='791000'>to Agarwal, because he's teaching
  002.</span> </p><p><span m='794000'>OK, so this is 6.002, and the rest of EECS
  is</span> <span m='798000'>somewhere out there. OK, so I'm going to do now
  is</span> <span m='802000'>throughout this course; I want you to think about
  which</span> <span m='806000'>part in this vignette we are in. So, right
  now,</span> <span m='810000'>I'm going to start here and take you here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='813000'>OK, and as you get closer and closer, things get
  simpler,</span> <span m='817000'>and simpler, and simpler.</span> </p><p><span
  m='819000'>Still, the final abstractions are pedal, brake,</span> <span
  m='822000'>steering wheel. I mean, that's the abstraction</span> <span
  m='825000'>to play a game, right, four or five very simple</span> <span
  m='828000'>interfaces, and that's all you need to know.</span> </p><p><span
  m='831000'>And everybody in the world can play stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='834000'>So remember, this stuff is complicated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='836000'>This stuff is very, very simple.</span> </p><p><span m='840000'>OK,
  and the more we build abstractions and come to this</span> <span
  m='843000'>side, things get simpler and simpler.</span> </p><p><span
  m='845000'>So, a large part of what I'll cover today is make the
  biggest</span> <span m='849000'>simplification. The biggest simplification
  we</span> <span m='851000'>will make his go from Maxwell's equation to some
  very,</span> <span m='855000'>very simple algebraic rules. OK, I did Maxwell's
  equations</span> <span m='858000'>myself. And I tell you,</span> <span
  m='859000'>they were very interesting stuff but complicated.</span>
  </p><p><span m='862000'>I can't imagine building efficient systems
  using</span> <span m='865000'>Maxwell's equations. So, let's take an
  example,</span> <span m='870000'>OK? So, let's say I have a battery.</span>
  </p><p><span m='874000'>Just switch to page three of your course notes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='879000'>And let's say I connect that to a bulb.</span>
  </p><p><span m='883000'>OK, and this is a wire. And, the battery supplies
  some</span> <span m='889000'>voltage, V, and I ask you a simple
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='893000'>What is the current through the
  bulb?</span> </p><p><span m='897000'>OK, so here is something that I can build
  using objects.</span> </p><p><span m='905000'>I can pick a round from stores
  and so on.</span> </p><p><span m='907000'>And I can collect them up in this
  way, and ask the question,</span> <span m='911000'>what is the current,
  I?</span> </p><p><span m='912000'>Now, if all you've done is learn about
  Maxwell's equations,</span> <span m='916000'>you can roll up your sleeves and
  say, ah-ha!</span> </p><p><span m='919000'>The first step is to write down all
  of Maxwell's equations,</span> <span m='923000'>and you can say, del cross E
  is minus del and go</span> <span m='926000'>on, and on, and on, OK, and write
  out all of</span> <span m='928000'>Maxwell's equations and say, now how do I
  get from there to</span> <span m='932000'>here? OK, it's very good.</span>
  </p><p><span m='935000'>You can do it. OK, you can do it,</span> <span
  m='937000'>but it's very complicated. OK, so instead,</span> <span
  m='939000'>what you're going to do is take the easy way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='942000'>So, what I want to remind you is that this course is
  actually</span> <span m='946000'>very easy. OK remember,</span> <span
  m='947000'>we're going to be building abstraction upon abstraction to</span>
  <span m='951000'>make your lives easier. If you think your lives are</span>
  <span m='954000'>getting more complicated, then you are not using</span> <span
  m='957000'>intuition enough. OK, just remember the big I</span> <span
  m='962000'>word. It's all about making things</span> <span m='964000'>simple.
  OK, so let me give you an</span> <span m='967000'>analogy. So, suppose you
  have an object.</span> </p><p><span m='970000'>OK, and I apply a force to the
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='973000'>It's an analogy, OK to get some insight
  into how</span> <span m='976000'>to do this. So, I say here's an
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='979000'>I apply a force, and I ask you the
  question.</span> </p><p><span m='982000'>What is the acceleration of the
  object when I apply a force,</span> <span m='987000'>F? So, how would you do
  it?</span> </p><p><span m='991000'>OK, and eighth, or ninth, or tenth grader
  can</span> <span m='993000'>do this. OK, they would ask me,</span> <span
  m='996000'>what's the mass of the object? OK, I ask you what is the</span>
  <span m='999000'>acceleration? You would turn around and ask</span> <span
  m='1002000'>me, what is the mass of the object?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1004000'>I tell you, the mass of the object is M.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1007000'>And then you say, oh sure, A is F divided by M,</span> <span
  m='1010000'>done. It's as simple as that.</span> </p><p><span m='1012000'>OK,
  I could have gone into all kinds of differential equations</span> <span
  m='1016000'>and so on to figure that out, but you asked me for the
  mass.</span> </p><p><span m='1022000'>And you gave me the answer, A is F
  divided by M.</span> </p><p><span m='1025000'>So, you ignored a bunch of
  things.</span> </p><p><span m='1028000'>You ignored the shape of the
  object.</span> </p><p><span m='1030000'>You ignored its color. You ignored its
  temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='1034000'>OK, and you ignored the soft or
  hard or whatever.</span> </p><p><span m='1037000'>OK, you ignored a whole
  bunch of things.</span> </p><p><span m='1040000'>You were focused on one
  thing. OK, you're focused on its mass.</span> </p><p><span m='1045000'>And, it
  turns out that the process really was developed</span> <span m='1049000'>from
  a set of simplifications. That is called,</span> <span m='1054000'>does
  anybody remember this? Point mass simplification.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1060000'>OK, so, in physics, you've done this before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1064000'>OK, you've simplified your lives by viewing objects as</span>
  <span m='1069000'>having a mass at a point, and force is acting at that</span>
  <span m='1075000'>point. OK, M is that property of the</span> <span
  m='1078000'>object that is of interest to you.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1082000'>This process is called, in physics, point mass</span> <span
  m='1086000'>discretization. OK, now using an analogy,</span> <span
  m='1094000'>and I'm going to show you a similar simple process to do
  the</span> <span m='1104000'>problem with the light bulb. OK, so take my light
  bulb</span> <span m='1111000'>again,</span> <span m='1122000'>And I focus on
  the filament of the light bulb.</span> </p><p><span m='1124000'>OK, all I care
  about is the current flowing through the</span> <span m='1128000'>light bulb.
  OK, I don't care about whether</span> <span m='1130000'>the filament is
  twisted, whether it's hot.</span> </p><p><span m='1133000'>I don't care about
  its shape. I don't care about its color.</span> </p><p><span m='1137000'>All I
  care about is the current.</span> </p><p><span m='1140000'>OK, so to do that,
  what we can do here at a very</span> <span m='1143000'>high level is since we
  just need the current and don't care about</span> <span m='1147000'>a bunch of
  other properties, we will simply replace the bulb</span> <span
  m='1152000'>with a discrete object called a resistor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1155000'>So the discrete object is a resistor, much like the point</span>
  <span m='1159000'>mass simplification that we did earlier that replaced the
  bulb</span> <span m='1163000'>filament with a object called a resistor, a
  discrete object</span> <span m='1167000'>called a resistor. Or a lump object
  called</span> <span m='1171000'>resister, and put a value next to it just like
  the mass for the</span> <span m='1177000'>object, a resistance value,
  R.</span> </p><p><span m='1179000'>OK, now what I can do is in the same
  manner, replace the battery</span> <span m='1184000'>with an object called a
  battery object, and connect that here,</span> <span m='1189000'>the voltage,
  V, applied to it.</span> </p><p><span m='1192000'>V falls across the resistor,
  and I get my I simply from</span> <span m='1196000'>Ohm's law as we divide by
  R. So, notice here,</span> <span m='1201000'>to replace this complicated bulb,
  this really twisty,</span> <span m='1204000'>weird old thing with this
  discreet thing called a</span> <span m='1207000'>resistor, and its only
  property of interest was its resistance</span> <span m='1211000'>value, R,
  direct analogy to what we did there.</span> </p><p><span m='1214000'>So, since
  R represents the only property of interest,</span> <span m='1218000'>we can
  simply ignore all the other things.</span> </p><p><span m='1221000'>So, notice
  here, we've done things the simple</span> <span m='1224000'>way. And
  remember,</span> <span m='1225000'>in EE, in the electrical engineering, we do
  things the</span> <span m='1228000'>simple way. OK, we could go the hard
  route</span> <span m='1233000'>and do Maxwell's equations, and get PhD's in
  physics,</span> <span m='1237000'>and so on. But out here,</span> <span
  m='1238000'>we are looking to do useful, interesting systems in the</span>
  <span m='1242000'>simplest way that we can. OK, we do things a simple
  way.</span> </p><p><span m='1246000'>All right, so we just did this, and boom,
  I found out what the</span> <span m='1251000'>current was. Now, I cheated a
  little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='1254000'>I've cheated a little bit. R is a
  lumped abstraction for</span> <span m='1258000'>the bulb. So, you look at this
  resistor</span> <span m='1261000'>here. That is simply a placeholder.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1264000'>It's a stand-in for this complicated thing called a
  bulb.</span> </p><p><span m='1268000'>It's a discreet object. It's a lumped
  object,</span> <span m='1271000'>and represents the bulb. Now, so most of
  6.002 will take</span> <span m='1274000'>off from here, OK, and that's
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='1277000'>To very simple stuff, like V is equal to
  IR,</span> <span m='1280000'>it's a simple high school algebra to take off in
  that</span> <span m='1283000'>direction. But before we go there,</span> <span
  m='1285000'>it's important to understand, why was it that we were able
  to</span> <span m='1290000'>make the simplification? OK, we did something
  else.</span> </p><p><span m='1294000'>Something's going on under the covers
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1297000'>On the one hand, I say let's use
  Maxwell's,</span> <span m='1299000'>and then I jump out and say, hey, we can
  just use this</span> <span m='1302000'>simple thing. I did something that
  allowed me</span> <span m='1305000'>to go from here to here. And you need to
  understand why</span> <span m='1308000'>I did that and how I did that.
  Understand it once,</span> <span m='1311000'>and then you won't have to need
  that information again.</span> </p><p><span m='1314000'>You just need to
  understand it. So, let's take a closer look at</span> <span m='1318000'>the
  bulb filament, and look at what we really did.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1322000'>So, here's my filament, A, and let's say that the</span> <span
  m='1328000'>surface area here, I label that SA,</span> <span m='1332000'>and
  the one down here SB, my voltage, V,</span> <span m='1337000'>applied there,
  and this is what I call my</span> <span m='1343000'>black box that I've
  replaced with a resistor.</span> </p><p><span m='1348000'>Notice that, in
  order for this to work,</span> <span m='1353000'>V and I need to be defined.
  So I needs to be defined,</span> <span m='1360000'>and V needs to be defined.
  OK, if I give you a random</span> <span m='1365000'>object, and I don't tell
  you anything else about the object,</span> <span m='1369000'>it's not clear I
  can do that. OK, if it's a much more general</span> <span
  m='1374000'>situation, I have to write down Maxwell's equations,</span> <span
  m='1378000'>and this is what I would write down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1381000'>Write down J dot dS as a function of the coordinate here</span>
  <span m='1385000'>integrated over the area minus, OK, I would have to start
  from</span> <span m='1390000'>there from one of Maxwell's equations.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1395000'>All right, notice that this becomes IA, and this
  becomes IB</span> <span m='1399000'>in our simplification. But, if I don't
  tell you</span> <span m='1403000'>anything else, you have to start from
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='1406000'>You will have some varying current here
  by point.</span> </p><p><span m='1411000'>You might have some other current
  coming out here because</span> <span m='1414000'>I may have some charge
  buildup happening inside.</span> </p><p><span m='1418000'>If charge is
  building up inside the filament;</span> <span m='1421000'>then I would have to
  put del q by del t out here,</span> <span m='1424000'>right, the current in
  minus the current out must equal charge</span> <span m='1428000'>buildup.
  Whoa, where is this and where</span> <span m='1431000'>is that? So this is
  reality.</span> </p><p><span m='1433000'>This is really, really what I have to
  do.</span> </p><p><span m='1435000'>But how did I get there? How did I get
  there?</span> </p><p><span m='1440000'>The key answer is, as engineers,</span>
  <span m='1442000'>when in doubt we simplify. Remember, we are
  engineers.</span> </p><p><span m='1445000'>Our goal in life is to build
  interesting systems.</span> </p><p><span m='1449000'>OK and some are motivated
  by money.</span> </p><p><span m='1451000'>OK, so our goal is to build
  interesting systems and do good</span> <span m='1455000'>to humanity. So, as
  long as we can build a</span> <span m='1458000'>good light bulb, we are
  happy.</span> </p><p><span m='1460000'>So what we can do is we can say, look,
  all I care about is</span> <span m='1463000'>building interesting systems. So
  I can say,</span> <span m='1466000'>hey, this stuff is too hard. Let's make
  the assumption that</span> <span m='1472000'>all the systems that we will
  consider will have this thing be</span> <span m='1476000'>zero. OK, in other
  words,</span> <span m='1477000'>if I take a complete object, if I take an
  element like a</span> <span m='1481000'>resistor or a capacitor, the box
  around the entire</span> <span m='1484000'>element, OK, and I want to just
  deal with those systems in which</span> <span m='1488000'>this thing is zero.
  You can come and beat me up and</span> <span m='1492000'>say, but why? Why
  not?</span> </p><p><span m='1493000'>Why am I doing this? And I am saying the
  world is</span> <span m='1497000'>arbitrary. I'm an engineer;</span> <span
  m='1498000'>I want to build good systems. By making this
  simplification,</span> <span m='1504000'>I eliminate this squiggle thing, and
  so on.</span> </p><p><span m='1507000'>I don't want to deal with it. I want to
  make my life simple.</span> </p><p><span m='1511000'>So this is gone to zero
  because, why?</span> </p><p><span m='1514000'>Because I have said that in the
  future I will only deal with</span> <span m='1519000'>those elements for which
  this is true.</span> </p><p><span m='1521000'>I'm going to discipline myself.
  I'm going to discipline myself</span> <span m='1526000'>to only deal with
  those systems. OK, Maxwell is turning around</span> <span m='1532000'>and, you
  know, mad at me and all that stuff,</span> <span m='1536000'>but tough. So
  this, what I've said about</span> <span m='1539000'>making a simplification
  here, and this is one of the</span> <span m='1543000'>simplifications I'm
  making. And I give a name to the</span> <span m='1548000'>simplification. And
  that's called the lumped</span> <span m='1551000'>matter discipline. OK, so
  I'm saying I will only</span> <span m='1555000'>deal with elements for which
  if I put a black box around it,</span> <span m='1560000'>this is going to be
  true. And if this is going to be</span> <span m='1566000'>true, then notice,
  there is no charge buildup.</span> </p><p><span m='1570000'>Current in must
  equal current out.</span> </p><p><span m='1573000'>Ah-ha! So this becomes
  IA.</span> </p><p><span m='1575000'>This becomes IB. Yes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1576000'>OK, I can now deal with IA's and IB's.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1580000'>And IB and IA are equal because this is zero.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1584000'>Notice that there is a whole bunch of depth here in the
  jump</span> <span m='1589000'>from here to here. As MIT graduates,</span>
  <span m='1593000'>you really, really need to understand why it is that
  we</span> <span m='1597000'>made that jump, and then go and use that,</span>
  <span m='1600000'>and do cool things. All right, this allows us to</span>
  <span m='1603000'>define I. We have a unique I associated</span> <span
  m='1606000'>with an element for the current through the element.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1610000'>We still have to worry about B, and I won't go
  through that in</span> <span m='1615000'>detail. The course notes have
  some</span> <span m='1617000'>discussion of that and so does the
  textbook.</span> </p><p><span m='1622000'>So V, AB is defined when del phi B,
  the rate of change of</span> <span m='1627000'>magnetic flux is zero. So, if I
  take the element and I</span> <span m='1631000'>take any region outside the
  element, this must be true.</span> </p><p><span m='1636000'>And you say, why
  should that be true?</span> </p><p><span m='1640000'>That's not true in
  general. Absolutely.</span> </p><p><span m='1643000'>It's not true in general.
  But I, because I choose to,</span> <span m='1648000'>I going to deal with only
  those elements.</span> </p><p><span m='1653000'>I will discipline myself. But
  these are only those</span> <span m='1656000'>elements for which this is true,
  and this is true.</span> </p><p><span m='1659000'>I'm going to limit my world.
  I'm going to create a play</span> <span m='1662000'>field for myself. You want
  to play;</span> <span m='1664000'>follow my rules. OK, and that's called
  the</span> <span m='1667000'>lumped matter discipline. So once you say that
  I'm going</span> <span m='1670000'>to adhere to the lump matter discipline,
  and this is true</span> <span m='1674000'>inside your elements. This is true
  outside the</span> <span m='1676000'>elements. You can define VA and
  VB,</span> <span m='1679000'>and good things happen to you. OK, let me show
  you a few</span> <span m='1683000'>examples of lumped elements. But
  remember,</span> <span m='1686000'>a large part of what we're doing is based
  on these two</span> <span m='1690000'>assumptions. And to just go through
  the</span> <span m='1693000'>background on that, I would encourage you to go
  to</span> <span m='1697000'>chapter 1 of your course notes and read through
  just as how</span> <span m='1701000'>this came about, that comes about.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1703000'>So, by doing that by adhering to a lumped matter
  discipline,</span> <span m='1708000'>we can now lump objects. We could lump a
  bulb into a</span> <span m='1712000'>resistor. OK, so to be clear,</span>
  <span m='1714000'>a certain number of lumped objects, and now,</span> <span
  m='1716000'>the universe is going to be comprised into lumped objects.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1720000'>OK, so before this, when he went home,</span> <span
  m='1722000'>we talked about eggs, and omelets,</span> <span m='1724000'>and
  light bulbs, and switches,</span> <span m='1726000'>but once you come to MIT,
  and after you've taken 6.002,</span> <span m='1729000'>you begin talking about
  lumped elements, you know,</span> <span m='1732000'>resistors, voltage
  sources, capacitors, little inky-dinky</span> <span m='1735000'>objects that
  follow the lumped matter discipline.</span> </p><p><span m='1740000'>OK, they
  stick to very simple rules, and the math that you</span> <span
  m='1744000'>have to do to analyze them is incredibly simple.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1747000'>What could be simpler than V is equal to IR?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1751000'>So, let me give you an example of interesting lumped
  elements,</span> <span m='1755000'>and then show you a couple of really nasty
  lumped elements.</span> </p><p><span m='1760000'>OK.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1769000'>OK, so what you see out here, so we characterize lumped</span>
  <span m='1773000'>elements by the VI characteristics.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1775000'>OK, you apply voltage, measure the current.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1779000'>OK, so what I can do is I can plot I here, and V here,</span>
  <span m='1783000'>and see what it looks like. OK, I can characterize
  elements</span> <span m='1788000'>by their VI relationship. And there are a
  bunch of</span> <span m='1791000'>elements that I can create based on the VI
  relationship.</span> </p><p><span m='1796000'>So let me show you a few
  examples.</span> </p><p><span m='1800000'>So for the resistor, since V is
  directly</span> <span m='1802000'>proportional to I, and R is a
  constant,</span> <span m='1805000'>I get a straight line. That's the I
  axis,</span> <span m='1808000'>the V axis, and this is the resistor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1811000'>What I actually have is a variable resistor,</span>
  <span m='1814000'>so I'm going to change the resistance value,</span> <span
  m='1817000'>R, and the curve will also change slope.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1820000'>OK, I changed the value of R because it's a variable</span> <span
  m='1824000'>resistor, and the changes slope because my R is different.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1830000'>OK, next, let me go to a fixed resistor, and this guy
  here on</span> <span m='1834000'>the screen to your left is a fixed
  resistor.</span> </p><p><span m='1837000'>And you see that its IV
  characteristic is a line of a</span> <span m='1841000'>given slope, 1 by R,
  and that's it.</span> </p><p><span m='1844000'>I can't change it. Number
  three,</span> <span m='1846000'>I have another lumped element called a Zener
  diode that you</span> <span m='1851000'>will see in the fourth week of this
  class, and the</span> <span m='1854000'>characteristics for the Zener diode
  look like this:</span> <span m='1858000'>IV. If my voltage goes across
  the</span> <span m='1861000'>Zener diode goes up slightly, the current shoots
  up.</span> </p><p><span m='1864000'>But if the voltage becomes negative I
  don't have any</span> <span m='1867000'>current flowing into it until the
  voltage passes on the</span> <span m='1871000'>threshold, at which point my
  current begins to build up.</span> </p><p><span m='1874000'>OK, so I can
  increase the voltage a little bit,</span> <span m='1877000'>and it can show
  that the current starts building up</span> <span m='1880000'>again. So that's
  another interesting</span> <span m='1882000'>lumped element called a Zener
  diode.</span> </p><p><span m='1884000'>Let's switch to the next one called a
  diode.</span> </p><p><span m='1886000'>So a diode looks like this: IV.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1890000'>As the voltage across the diode becomes
  positive,</span> <span m='1893000'>around .6 volts, or thereabout,</span>
  <span m='1895000'>the current begins to shoot up. But when the voltage is
  below</span> <span m='1900000'>that threshold of .6, then my current is almost
  zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1904000'>It's another lumped element called a
  diode.</span> </p><p><span m='1907000'>And you will begin using these elements
  in your 002 lives to</span> <span m='1911000'>build interesting systems. The
  next example is a</span> <span m='1915000'>thermistor. A thermistor is a
  resistor</span> <span m='1917000'>whose resistance varies with
  temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='1922000'>OK, so this is a very expensive
  little hairdryer,</span> <span m='1928000'>and what I'm going to do is blow
  some hot air at my</span> <span m='1934000'>resistor, and you're going to see
  that its value is going to</span> <span m='1942000'>change depending on how
  much I heat it.</span> </p><p><span m='1947000'>So as it cools down, let me
  cool it down,</span> <span m='1952000'>so you can see it's coming down.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1958000'>I can zap it again. I could do this all day.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1961000'>This is so much fun. OK, so that's another</span>
  <span m='1965000'>interesting lumped element. As the temperature rises,</span>
  <span m='1969000'>its resistance changes. The next thing is called a</span>
  <span m='1973000'>photo resistor. It's a resistor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1976000'>It used to be a resistor; Lorenzo?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1980000'>Oh OK, that's fine. So this is a photo resistor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1983000'>And notice that it almost behaves like an open
  circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='1988000'>But what I'm going to do is shine
  some light on it.</span> </p><p><span m='1992000'>When I shine light on it, it
  begins to conduct and</span> <span m='1996000'>becomes a resistor of some
  value.</span> </p><p><span m='1998000'>There you go. OK, so that's a photo
  resistor.</span> </p><p><span m='2002000'>So now I'm going to show you a
  battery.</span> </p><p><span m='2005000'>Notice we did talk about batteries
  before.</span> </p><p><span m='2010000'>I'll show you a battery. So before you
  show a battery,</span> <span m='2013000'>just thinking your own minds, what
  should the IV</span> <span m='2016000'>characteristic of a battery look
  like?</span> </p><p><span m='2019000'>IV. A battery supplies a constant</span>
  <span m='2021000'>voltage. You know your little cell,</span> <span
  m='2024000'>the AA battery, 1.5 volts?</span> </p><p><span m='2025000'>So,
  think of what the IV characteristic of a battery</span> <span
  m='2029000'>should look like for three seconds before it shows you.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2033000'>This is the one I showed, Lorenzo?.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2035000'>It's a straight line. This is a good battery.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2040000'>It's a straight, vertical line,</span> <span
  m='2041000'>but says that the voltage is 1.5 volts, or thereabouts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2045000'>No matter what current it supplies as an ideal
  voltage</span> <span m='2048000'>source, it has a fixed voltage, V, and no
  matter what the</span> <span m='2052000'>current going through is. Now, I'll
  show you a dud,</span> <span m='2055000'>a bad battery, and this is what the
  bad</span> <span m='2058000'>battery looks like. So, many of you have had
  your</span> <span m='2061000'>car batteries die on you. When you go to the
  store,</span> <span m='2064000'>they check your batteries. They use exactly
  this</span> <span m='2067000'>principle, that dead batteries have
  resistance.</span> </p><p><span m='2072000'>By the way, you see slopes
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2074000'>You're thinking of resistance. OK, they
  can use this property</span> <span m='2078000'>to figure out that your battery
  is dead.</span> </p><p><span m='2081000'>So that's a dead battery. And
  finally,</span> <span m='2084000'>let me show you a bulb. We started with a
  bulb,</span> <span m='2087000'>and so I need to end, OK, we started with a
  bulb,</span> <span m='2091000'>so I need to end with a bulb. And what you will
  see is that a</span> <span m='2095000'>bulb simply behaves like a
  resistor.</span> </p><p><span m='2097000'>Its IV curve is going to look like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='2102000'>OK, notice this is my bulb. And guess
  what,</span> <span m='2104000'>it behaves like a resistor. It's a very
  interesting kind of</span> <span m='2108000'>resistor, so I won't go into
  details for now.</span> </p><p><span m='2111000'>But notice its IV
  characteristic behaves like a</span> <span m='2114000'>resistor. OK, so those
  are some pretty</span> <span m='2117000'>standard lumped elements. You deal
  with a lot more sets</span> <span m='2120000'>of lumped elements, switches,
  MOSFETs,</span> <span m='2123000'>capacitors, inductors, a bunch of other fun
  stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='2126000'>But before we do that, what I wanted to
  tell you,</span> <span m='2129000'>don't go berserk on this abstraction
  binge.</span> </p><p><span m='2134000'>Too much of anything is bad for
  you.</span> </p><p><span m='2136000'>So what I'm going to show you is,
  abstractions or models are</span> <span m='2139000'>only valid provided you
  work within a set of constraints.</span> </p><p><span m='2143000'>Notice, we
  have already had this tacit handshake which said</span> <span m='2146000'>that
  we follow the discipline. Even after we follow the</span> <span
  m='2149000'>discipline, there are ranges to how well physical elements
  can</span> <span m='2153000'>behave like ideal lumped elements.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2155000'>OK, for example, what we will do is show you
  the</span> <span m='2158000'>resistor. And it's going to look like a</span>
  <span m='2162000'>resistor. And I'm going to keep</span> <span
  m='2164000'>increasing the voltage around it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2167000'>OK, what's going to happen at some point?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2170000'>I just keep doing that. If it's an ideal element,</span> <span
  m='2174000'>if you're a theorist, you say, oh yeah,</span> <span
  m='2177000'>the curve will keep extending until I reach infinity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2182000'>But this is a practical resistor, so people out here
  can</span> <span m='2186000'>cover your eyes or something. OK, so you're
  abstraction can't</span> <span m='2191000'>predict that. All it says is the
  current is</span> <span m='2196000'>an amp. It can't predict the heat,</span>
  <span m='2198000'>light, or the smell. In the laboratory,</span> <span
  m='2201000'>even, you get the smell. You know what somebody has just</span>
  <span m='2205000'>done. So that's one example of the</span> <span
  m='2207000'>lumped abstraction breaking down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2210000'>So, if I really believe that my own BS, anything is a
  lumped</span> <span m='2214000'>element. So here's a pickle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2216000'>A pickle is a lumped element. I can choose it as a
  lumped</span> <span m='2222000'>resistor. But this is a very
  interesting</span> <span m='2225000'>lumped resistor. Don't try this at
  home.</span> </p><p><span m='2229000'>This is a standard pickle into which you
  are pumping 110 V AC.</span> </p><p><span m='2234000'>I promise you, this is a
  standard pickle.</span> </p><p><span m='2238000'>So, it has a fixed
  resistance, but your lumped abstraction</span> <span m='2243000'>cannot
  predict the nice light and sound effect.</span> </p><p><span m='2247000'>OK,
  so the last two or three minutes what I want to do,</span> <span
  m='2252000'>so remember, don't get carried away by</span> <span
  m='2255000'>abstractions. There are limits.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2259000'>OK, you can't predict everything.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2262000'>OK, that's the smell of a pickle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2265000'>OK, so let me give you a preview of some upcoming</span> <span
  m='2269000'>attractions, and show you one more quick simplification in
  the</span> <span m='2275000'>last few minutes. So what we can do,</span> <span
  m='2278000'>once we build these lumped elements, we can connect them in</span>
  <span m='2283000'>circuits. OK, so I can build a circuit,</span> <span
  m='2287000'>of the sort. So here's a voltage source with</span> <span
  m='2290000'>a bunch of resistors. I can connect them with wires</span> <span
  m='2294000'>and build a circuit of the sort. One interesting question we
  can</span> <span m='2298000'>ask ourselves is, under the lumped matter</span>
  <span m='2301000'>discipline, what can we say about the voltages?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2304000'>OK, if I go around the loop, provided my world
  adheres to</span> <span m='2308000'>the lumped matter discipline, what can I
  say about the</span> <span m='2312000'>voltages around this loop? Ah-ha,
  Maxwell again,</span> <span m='2316000'>right? So, I can write
  Maxwell's</span> <span m='2319000'>appropriate equation to solve that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2322000'>OK, voltages have something to do with E and your
  integral of E</span> <span m='2327000'>dot dl and all of that stuff,
  right?</span> </p><p><span m='2330000'>So this is the appropriate Maxwell's
  equations to use.</span> </p><p><span m='2334000'>And I want to find out what
  happens here.</span> </p><p><span m='2338000'>Now remember, under LMD, I made
  the</span> <span m='2340000'>assumption. OK, my world,</span> <span
  m='2344000'>my playground, has del phi B by del t being</span> <span
  m='2349000'>zero. The rate of change of flux is</span> <span m='2353000'>zero.
  So, under these circumstances,</span> <span m='2356000'>I can write this. I
  can break up this line</span> <span m='2361000'>integral into three parts
  across the voltage source and across</span> <span m='2368000'>the two
  resistors and write that down.</span> </p><p><span m='2374000'>OK, and then
  when I can do, is now that the right-hand side</span> <span m='2378000'>is
  zero, I can simply take this. And I know that E dot dl across</span> <span
  m='2382000'>this element is simply VCA. This is VAB,</span> <span
  m='2385000'>and this is VBC equals zero. OK, so when I make the</span> <span
  m='2389000'>assumption that del phi B by del t is zero, and I go around
  this</span> <span m='2393000'>loop, apply Maxwell's equations, what do I
  find?</span> </p><p><span m='2398000'>I find that the sum of the voltages, VCA
  plus VAB plus VBC,</span> <span m='2403000'>is zero. That's fantastic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2406000'>So now, I could say hasta la vista to this baby
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2411000'>And I can focus on this guy and say,
  Maxwell's equations,</span> <span m='2417000'>this thing with squiggles and
  dels and all that stuff,</span> <span m='2422000'>can be simplified to the sum
  of the voltages across a set of</span> <span m='2428000'>elements in a loop in
  a circuit is zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2434000'>OK, and this is called
  Kirchhoff's first first law,</span> <span m='2439000'>KVL. OK,
  similarly,</span> <span m='2440000'>in recitation section, you'll see the
  application of</span> <span m='2446000'>Kirchhoff's current law, which comes
  from this be equal</span> <span m='2451000'>to zero, and all the currents
  coming into a node being zero.</span> </p><p><span m='2457000'>So, KVL and KCl
  directly come out of the lumped matter</span> <span m='2462000'>discipline.
  And you can use those to solve</span> <span m='2466000'>circuits like
  this.</span> </p>
