Sample Topics for the Final Paper
---------------------------------

Twenty-five percent of the course grade is based upon a final paper on a math finance topic of the student's choice. Below are some sample topics. Students may propose other topics as well.

### Portfolio Management

Based on what you learned in class, research further and come up with your own views in portfolio risk management.

### Regime-Shift Modeling

Detail one or more approaches to regime-shift modeling, addressing the statistical modeling methodology and its use in a specific, real-world application.

### Low-Volatility Investing

Critically review the rationales of low-volatility investing strategies in the U.S. equity market and their connection to the portfolio theory covered in class; evaluate the performance of such strategies as implemented in exchange-traded funds and / or mutual funds.

### Modeling Financial Bubbles

Detail one or more approaches to modeling asset bubbles; e.g., the work of Didier Sornette.

### Relationship between Black-Scholes and Heat Equations

*   Go through the change of variables to get from Black-Scholes PDE to Heat Equation.
*   Go through calculations verifying that a European call option price for a lognormaly distributed stock is in fact a discounted expected value of the pay-off under risk neutral measure.
*   Explore possible numerical methods for the solution with various boundary conditions.
*   Go through computations showing that Black-Scholes price of a digital option is a partial derivative of the call option price with respect to strike.

### Hybrid products

*   Price zero coupon bonds in USD and EUR in this jump–diffusion model.
*   Determine the dynamic hedging strategy. There are two sources of risk, so need at least 2 hedging instruments. FX forwards are a great candidate.

### HJM vs Short-Rate Interest Rate Models.

*   Start from the equation for forward rates _df__tT_ = _μtT dt_ + _σtTdB__t_ and derive the no-arbitrage condition for drift _μ__tT_.
*   Derive drift _at_ for the short rate Ho-Lee Model _dr__t_ = _atdt + σdB__t_. Next, show that the Ho-Lee model can be written in the HJM form. Remember that _r__t_ = _f__tt_.
*   Add a mean reversion to the Ho-Lee model _drt = (at - κrt)dt + σdB__t_ and write it in the HJM form.

### Ross Recovery

*   Try to offer financial intuition for the Perron Forbenius theorem for positive matrices.
*   Try to extend Ross recovery to a countable state space for a Markov chain.
