Introduction to Linear Algebra. 4th ed. [Wellesley-Cambridge Press](http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/), 2009. ISBN: 9780980232714.

The Table of Contents, Preface, and selected chapters are [freely available online](http://math.mit.edu/linearalgebra/).

There is newer edition of the book: [![Buy at Amazon](images/a_logo_17.gif)](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0980232775/ref=nosim/mitopencourse-20?linkCode=w61&imprToken=88O6qQed.wV654ySgRZ8OQ&slotNum=1) Strang, Gilbert.

NOTE: More material on linear algebra (and much more about differential equations) is in Professor Strang's 2014 textbook [Differential Equations and Linear Algebra](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/dela). In 2016, the textbook was developed into a series of 55 short videos, [Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with Gilbert Strang and Cleve Moler](http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-009-learn-differential-equations-up-close-with-gilbert-strang-and-cleve-moler-fall-2015/index.htm).

## Previous Years' Problem Sets and Exams
Problem sets, quizzes, and exams from [previous years are also available](http://web.mit.edu/18.06/www/old.shtml).
