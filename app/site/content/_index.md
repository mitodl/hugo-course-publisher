##### **Course Highlights**
This course parallels the combination of theory and applications in Professor Strangâ€™s textbook Introduction to Linear Algebra. The course picks out four key applications in the book: Graphs and Networks; Systems of Differential Equations; Least Squares and Projections; and Fourier Series and the Fast Fourier Transform.
