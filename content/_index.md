course-description: "This is a basic subject on matrix theory and linear algebra. Emphasis is given to topics that will be useful in other disciplines, including systems of equations, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvalues, similarity, and positive definite matrices."
course-highlights: "This course parallels the combination of theory and applications in Professor Strangâ€™s textbook Introduction to Linear Algebra. The course picks out four key applications in the book: Graphs and Networks; Systems of Differential Equations; Least Squares and Projections; and Fourier Series and the Fast Fourier Transform."
