    <p>NOTE: More material on linear algebra (and much more about differential equations) is in Professor Strang's 2014
        textbook <em><a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/dela">Differential Equations and Linear Algebra</a></em>. In 2016,
        the textbook was developed into a series of 55 short videos,&nbsp;<em><a

    <h2 class="subhead">Goals</h2>
    <p>The goals for 18.06 are using matrices and also understanding them.</p>
    <p>Here are key computations and some of the ideas behind them:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Solving Ax = b for square systems by elimination (pivots, multipliers, back substitution, invertibility of A,
            factorization into A = LU)</li>
        <li>Complete solution to Ax = b (column space containing b, rank of A, nullspace of A and special solutions to Ax =
            0 from row reduced R)</li>
        <li>Basis and dimension (bases for the four fundamental subspaces)</li>
        <li>Least squares solutions (closest line by understanding projections)</li>
        <li>Orthogonalization by Gram-Schmidt (factorization into A = QR)</li>
        <li>Properties of determinants (leading to the cofactor formula and the sum over all n! permutations, applications
            to inv(A) and volume)</li>
        <li>Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (diagonalizing A, computing powers A^k and matrix exponentials to solve difference
            and differential equations)</li>
        <li>Symmetric matrices and positive definite matrices (real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, tests for x'Ax
            &gt; 0, applications)</li>
        <li>Linear transformations and change of basis (connected to the Singular Value Decomposition - orthonormal bases
            that diagonalize A)</li>
        <li>Linear algebra in engineering (graphs and networks, Markov matrices, Fourier matrix, Fast Fourier Transform,
            linear programming)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="subhead">Homework</h2>
    <p>The homeworks are essential in learning linear algebra. They are not a test and you are encouraged to talk to other
        students about difficult problems-after you have found them difficult. Talking about linear algebra is healthy. But
        you must write your own solutions.</p>
    <h2 class="subhead">Exams</h2>
    <p>There will be three one-hour exams at class times and a final exam. The use of calculators or notes is not permitted
        during the exams.</p>
    <h2 class="subhead">Grading</h2>

    <h2 class="subhead">MATLAB&reg;</h2>
    <p>Some homework problems will require you to use MATLAB, an important tool for numerical linear algebra. No previous
        MATLAB experience is required in 18.06. The <a
            href="/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/related-resources">related resources</a> section has
        links to information about MATLAB, including a tutorial.</p>
